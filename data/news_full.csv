Updated

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says he will not accept an offer to resettle asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru in New Zealand at this stage.

Key points: Malcolm Turnbull says Australia has an arrangement with the US

""We cannot ignore the human face of what Australia is dealing with,"" Jacinda Ardern says

Bill Shorten earlier called on Mr Turnbull to accept the offer

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern discussed the offer with Mr Turnbull today, as close to 600 men refuse to leave the now closed centre, despite water, food and power being cut off.

Many of the men say they are too afraid to resettle in alternative accommodation and are refusing to leave the detention centre, which is also a Papua New Guinea (PNG) naval base.

Mr Turnbull thanked Ms Ardern for the offer, which was first made by former prime minister John Key, and said his Government remained focused on a refugee resettlement deal with the United States.

""The offer has been restated, we thank New Zealand for making that offer, we are not taking it up at this time,"" Mr Turnbull said.

But Mr Turnbull did not rule out accepting Ms Ardern's offer at a later stage.

""What we are seeking to do is ensure there are opportunities for resettlement for the people on Manus Island and Nauru,"" he said.

""We have an arrangement with the United States where a substantial number — 1,250 — can, subject to the US rigours vetting, be resettled in the United States.

""We want to pursue those, conclude those arrangements, and then in the wake of that obviously we can consider other ones.""

Ms Ardern said some of the discussions with Mr Turnbull were ""challenging"" and ""frank"".

""This is a very genuine offer,"" she said.

""We of course do not have the circumstances that Australia is operating under, but we also cannot ignore the human face of what Australia is dealing with.

""The offer absolutely remains on the table.""

New Zealand has a more compassionate approach: Di Natale

Mr Turnbull's decision not to accept the offer may prolong what Greens leader Richard Di Natale has called a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" on Manus Island.

The PNG Supreme Court ruled the detention of asylum seekers was illegal and the PNG Government says it is Australia's responsibility to deal with those who do not want to resettle in the country.

The stand-off at the Manus Island detention centre prompted Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to issue a statement on Friday, calling on Mr Turnbull to accept the offer, describing it as not dissimilar to the US deal.

That was dismissed by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, who said Mr Shorten was trying to appease the left of his party with ""cheap political stunts and mealy-mouthed words"".

He said the statement would be ""music to the ears of people smugglers"" and that he was making policy on the run.

But this morning, a Government backbencher, former defence minister Kevin Andrews, said the proposal should be seriously considered.

""The reality is, we have an intractable problem at the present time,"" he told Sky News.

""Yes, the United States are going to accept some of these people but there is still a large number there.""

Mr Andrews said any deal would need to ensure people smugglers were not encouraged to restart dangerous voyages to Australia.

Senator Di Natale said New Zealand had a more compassionate approach to refugees.

""It is so important that we bring them here and allow them to make a contribution and our neighbours across the ditch are showing us up,"" he told ABC Insiders.

""They have said they are prepared to shelter some of these people and they are showing the decency and compassion that this Australian Government is so lacking.""

The Greens leader also defended Adam Bandt's description of Mr Dutton as a ""terrorist"", remarks made during a refugee rally yesterday.

""Amnesty International have said that Peter Dutton presides over a regime that tortures people,"" Senator Di Natale said.

""We are talking about people who have been attacked and assaulted in these camps, where women who have been raped have been denied terminations.""

Updated

From high stakes to well done steaks. It says something about the state of the world that the pre-arrival media briefing for Donald Trump's visit to Japan covered possible nuclear war and whether the US President will have ketchup with his beef.

Key points: Japan is the first stop on Trump's 12-day Asian trip

Visit includes Wagyu beef and golf with Japanese Prime Minister and world-ranked player Hideki Matsuyama

Discussions between Mr Trump and Mr Abe likely to revolve around trade and North Korea

The focus on North Korea's nuclear ambitions is an obvious one.

A Japanese official told reporters the country's famed Wagyu beef will be on the menu today, prompting fears of a culinary gaffe.

In May, Mr Trump shocked the foodie world by ordering his $71 steak cooked ""well done"" and (gasp) smothering it in tomato sauce.

Asked about the prospect of a similar food snob crime against high-end Wagyu, the Japanese foreign affairs official implied a subtle dance of manners is at play.

""We will prepare ketchup,"" the official said.

""If President Trump wants to use ketchup, we will provide it.""

After a stopover in Hawaii, Japan is the first stop on Mr Trump's 12-day Asian trip.

Air Force One touched down at the US air base at Yokota on Sunday just before 1:00pm (AEDT), and Mr Trump stepped onto the tarmac as a band played Uptown Funk.

Mr Trump and first lady Melania were welcomed by an enthusiastic crowd and he was presented with a bomber jacket, which he quickly put on after removing his suit coat.

Mr Trump addressed American service personnel, calling Japan a treasured partner and crucial ally and telling his audience no dictator or regime should ever underestimate American resolve.

""We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defence of our freedom,"" Mr Trump said.

Golf diplomacy

The first thing on Mr Trump's agenda was a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is riding high after a solid election win two weeks ago.

At Mr Trump's request, they were joined by one of the world's best golfers, Hideki Matsuyama.

""Golf diplomacy"" has provided common ground in the past, with Mr Abe gifting Mr Trump an expensive gold-coloured driver in May, and the US leader giving a golf shirt in return.

Mr Trump claims a handicap of 2.8, although Golf Magazine has questioned that, saying that while Mr Trump is a surprisingly good player, a 73 round (as claimed recently) would put him in the league of retired professionals.

The US President has denied allegations — including claims from actor Samuel L Jackson and retired boxer Oscar De La Hoya — that he cheats at golf.

Mr Abe's handicap is unknown but he is thought to average 90-100 over 18 holes, and is known to hold the flag while others putt — a humble act for a man of great power.

The big issues

The conversation on and off the golf course will likely revolve around trade and North Korea, cited by both sides as the main issues for the leaders to discuss.

The Obama-era policy of ""strategic patience"" has been thrown out the window by Mr Trump, who has bluntly confronted the paranoid regime and hurled insults at ""Rocket Man"" Kim Jong-un.

North Korea is reportedly getting close to developing a missile that could hit the west coast of the US and shrinking a nuclear device small enough to go into that missile — raising the threat level from serious to existential.

""We want to get it solved. It's a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved,"" Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One before landing.

He said a decision would be made soon on whether to add reclusive North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

As a near neighbour, Japan has long lived with the prospect of being attacked by North Korea, with Pyongyang firing two test missiles over the nation in recent months.

""The greatest concern is that Trump may prove to be a 'wild card' in the carefully orchestrated and balanced geo-politics of the region,"" said Annelise Riles, a professor of law and anthropology at Cornell University.

""Asian politicians and diplomats will surely seize of this occasion to try to educate the President about the subtle ways they effectively manage the North Korean threat.""

The US President will meet the families of Japanese people abducted by North Korea and forced to teach Japanese.

Mr Trump appears to have taken up the issue with some enthusiasm after Mr Abe personally explained it to him and asked for his support.

Despite their differences the two leaders appear to get along well, a bond secured over the course of nine meetings and 16 phone calls.

North Korea remains the focus, but the militarisation of Japan's Self Defence Force and the future of trade after the US withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations are also likely to be on the agenda.

""One of the things we're going to be very focused on is trade because trade has not been done well for 25 years by the United States with this part of the world, with any part of the world,"" Mr Trump said on Air Force One.

""We're going to be discussing reciprocal trade. Fair, free but reciprocal.""

Japan represents something of a soft landing for the US President's foray into Asia — a chance to stretch his legs on the golf course after long flights and warm up his diplomatic skills with a friend.

Updated

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says constitutional recognition of an Indigenous voice to Parliament would have been ""contrary to the principles of equality and citizenship"".

Key points: Body to which only Indigenous Australians can be elected not a desirable model, PM says

Referendum Council recommended Indigenous voice to Parliament after nationwide meetings

PM's decision described by Labor as ""kick in the guts"" for the council

The advisory body was the key recommendation of the Referendum Council and the landmark Uluru Statement from the Heart.

Mr Turnbull abandoned plans to hold a referendum to recognise Indigenous Australians last month, saying the body was neither ""desirable or capable of winning acceptance"".

The decision has been described by Labor ""a kick in the guts"" for the council, who described the proposal as ""modest"", ""reasonable"" and ""capable of attracting the necessary support of the Australian people"".

Mr Turnbull said he supported a stronger voice for Indigenous Australians in all aspects of society, before criticising the Referendum Council's recommendation.

""Our view is that is not a model that is desirable and the reason for that is our national representative institutions are based on the proposition that they are open to every Australian,"" Mr Turnbull said.

""To have a national representative assembly — which is what we are talking about here — would be in the Constitution and to which only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders can be elected.

""This is contrary to principles of equality and of citizenship.""

PM's comments on recommendation 'misconceived'

The Prime Minister said the advisory body would have effectively been a third chamber of Federal Parliament, despite proponents of the body denying this.

""You don't respect people by telling them what they want to hear or by kicking ideas you think have no merit off into the long grass or into a committee,"" Mr Turnbull said.

""You have got to be fair dinkum, you've got to be forthright.

""We believe it is important to deliver recognition, but focus on things that are achievable.""

But the president of the NSW Bar Association, Arthur Moses SC, said the Prime Minister has misunderstood the recommendations of the Referendum Council.

""In no way does the voice recommendation impact on the sovereignty of the Parliament or create a third chamber of Parliament,"" he said.

""What the Prime Minister has misunderstood is it is no different to the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council which the Prime Minister and Minister for Indigenous Affairs appoints.""

Mr Moses also criticised Mr Turnbull's comments on the constitutional recognition of an Indigenous voice to Parliament being ""contrary to equality and citizenship"".

""With the greatest respect to the Prime Minister I think on this issue those comments are misconceived,"" he said.

""It is important that the report be properly understood, first of all by our political leaders and explained by our political leaders to the community and we should never underestimate the decency and intelligence of Australians when it comes to dealing with such sensitive issue.

""As a nation we are better than that and that is an issue that warrants serious consideration rather than being dismissed.""

The Referendum Council's Noel Pearson described the decision to reject the body as devastating for the Indigenous community.

""I think Malcolm Turnbull has broken the First Nations hearts of this country, expressed in the Uluru Statement from the Heart,"" Mr Pearson said.

""He accused John Howard of doing that in 1999 and he has done the same thing in relation to recognition of Indigenous Australians.""

Joel Werner,"It's probably the most famous chord in popular music — but for decades, no-one could figure out exactly how to play the opening chord of A Hard Day's Night.",2017-11-05T02:00:35Z,abc-news-au,How mathematics revealed a Beatles secret,http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2017-11-05/a-hard-days-night-how-mathematics-revealed-beatles-secret/9093348,http://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/9093946-1x1-large.jpg?v=2,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"It's probably the most recognisable sound in popular music.

""This is the one chord that everyone around the world knows,"" says Randy Bachman, a rock star in his own right from The Guess Who and Bachman Turner Overdrive.

It dates to July 1964 — the height of Beatlemania. The band was about to release its third album.

For the first time, it was all original music. Plus, the Beatles were shifting away from their rock 'n' roll roots to a more poppy sound, and this album was to be the soundtrack for their first feature film.

They needed to make a statement.

After a lot of experimentation, the band come up with a wondrous, jangling cacophony of sound: the opening chord to the song, album, and film A Hard Day's Night.

""To me, it's like the feeling I might get if I jumped into a lake on a hot summer's day,"" Beatles superfan Jason Brown says.

""I don't think there's another song with an opening like that. It's just an indescribable chord of beauty.""

Indescribable and — as it turns out — really rather mysterious.

Because for decades, no-one could figure out exactly how those two seconds of music were made.

Share The Beatles brave the rain in Sydney on their Australian tour in 1964.

The magical mystery

You might be wondering how a chord could be a mystery — especially one of the most well-known chords played by one of history's most famous bands.

Surely anyone trained in music theory could figure out what notes fit together to make a particular sound?

It's not that easy.

For starters: we're humans, with human flaws. Even the most well-trained musicians will sometimes disagree when transcribing chords by ear, and nonstandard chords are obviously even harder.

""It's hard to tell exactly what is being played,"" says Jason Brown, who also happens to be a professor of mathematics at Dalhousie University in Canada, and a musician himself.

""People hear notes that aren't in chords, and they miss notes that are there. Every musician, no matter how schooled, will hear different things.""

The physics of sound isn't on your side, either.

""When a string is plucked, you not only get the main frequency, but you get harmonics, which are higher multiples of that original frequency.""

This shifting mish-mash of sound swamps your brain, along with incidental noise. ""Anything else rattling in the room"" will produce its own frequencies, Dr Brown says.

So it's not entirely surprising that the particular notes in this chord remained a bit of a puzzle.

But why not just ask a Beatle?

Share The Beatles arriving at London Airport after a trip to Paris in 1964.

Ask Paul

Well, somebody tried that back in February 2001. In an online chat, someone asked George Harrison how he played the opening chord to A Hard Day's Night — and he could only vaguely remember his own part in the chord, let alone what any of the other Beatles were playing.

""You'll have to ask Paul about the bass note to get the proper story,"" he wrote.

So there appears to be no first-hand account on record. And even if there were, it might not be reliable.

""In the absence of having anyone there transcribe what actually was being played, it is a mystery,"" says Dr Brown.

1964 was a chaotic time for the Beatles. They were constantly busy recording, playing live, filming movies and just generally being the biggest band on the planet.

The song A Hard Day's Night was recorded in a single day.

""I think it's hard [for them] to remember exactly what was played,"" Dr Brown explains. ""They remember big-picture things … but not all the details.""

Everybody has a view

So the chord became not just a mystery, but a favourite subject of debate among Beatles fans and musicians.

Rock star Randy Bachman, of The Guess Who and Bachman Turner Overdrive, was pretty sure he'd solved the mystery when he got behind the scenes at Abbey Road Studios with George Martin's son Giles.

Bachman heard what he thought were the original source tapes, reproduced track-by-track from a computer, and pieced together his own version of the chord.

""It was George on a 12-string [electric guitar] ... And it's an F chord, but you put a G on top, and you put a G on the bottom, and you put a C next to that G,"" he explains. ""Paul's playing a D on the bass, and John's rhythm guitar was a Dsus4.""

And it was close — but not close enough for Dr Brown.

He has his doubts about those ""source tapes"". That's because when A Hard Day's Night was recorded, the drums, bass and two guitars were all recorded onto the same track.

""The process of separating the instruments was done through software,"" he explains. But the software isn't perfect.

And Dr Brown would know. He's run a similar analysis himself.

""I'd known about the controversy since I tried to play the chord on the guitar.""

As a teenager, he discovered the Beatles at the same time as he was learning to play guitar.

""I would spend eight to ten hours a day in the summer during high school, teaching myself to play The Beatles' songs.""

He'd pore over Beatles songbooks with chord charts to all the songs. But every book seemed to have a different transcription for the opening chord of A Hard Day's Night.

""Every book was transcribing what they thought the Beatles had played, but there was no way of telling what was right and what was wrong.""

Music + mathematics

In 2004, celebrations for the album's 40th anniversary reignited Dr Brown's fascination with the mystery. By then, he was a maths professor.

""I was in the habit of just picking up math books to read for interest, and one of the books that I picked up had a chapter on mathematics and sound,"" he explains.

""I thought of combining the music with the mathematics, and whether there'd be a scientific way to decide how the chord was being played — as opposed to just using your ears.""

That crucial chapter introduced Dr Brown to Fourier transforms: a mathematical technique that lets you take a signal, like a musical a chord, and break it down into its component parts.

""I could decompose the opening chord into a bunch of these fundamental notes. I got in the order of 30,000 of them,"" he says.

That's a lot of frequencies for one chord. But of course, some of them are loud, and some are very faint.

""I realised that the notes that were actually being played in the chord would be amongst the loudest ones,"" Dr Brown says.

""This allowed me to start making some mathematical deductions from the data that I got.""

He matched the loud frequencies to the instruments that must have played them, finding a bunch of notes that he — and everyone else before him — expected to be there. But there were also things missing.

""There were other notes that I thought were in the chord that weren't there — that people had transcribed into the chord because they believed that it had to be in the chord, but actually weren't there.""

Share The Beatles with fill-in drummer Jimmie Nicol in Melbourne, 1964.

Ghost notes

These are called ghost notes: notes that your brain expects to hear, based on the context they appear in, but that aren't actually present. For example, most Beatles songbooks transcribe the chord with a G note on the lowest guitar string.

""There are Gs in the chord, there's just no low G on the bottom,"" Dr Brown says.

""In fact, the bottom note being played is a D on Paul McCartney's bass, and the notes being played by George Harrison ... actually have an A on the bottom.""

Alongside all of these deductions, Dr Brown also made allowances for human — or Beatle — error.

""When I was moving the frequencies to the closest notes, some were quite a distance away. It's slightly out of tune — forever! That's part of the beauty of the chord.""

But even after all this effort, something was still amiss.

No matter which way Dr Brown arranged his data, it never completely lined up with the instruments that were assumed to have played the chord.

This arresting, infuriating musical moment, deconstructed mathematically, just wasn't playable by three Beatles on three Beatle guitars.

""From everything that I had read before ... I had expected that it was just George Harrison's 12-string. But I ran into a roadblock because it wasn't playable on a guitar.

""[Yet] I still ran into logical problems, even if I allowed the chord to be not just being played by George Harrison, but by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.""

Dr Brown's roadblock came in the form of three frequencies for a certain F note that couldn't be attributed to any of the guitars, no matter how many possibilities he entertained.

""I almost gave up looking at the chord, but then I realised that I had an assumption I'd carried with me — that the Beatles had played that opening chord.

""What happens if that assumption wasn't quite true? What happens if there was another instrument?""

Another instrument — with keys

""Later on in the song, you can clearly hear a piano doubling George Harrison's lead guitar solo. So I thought, maybe there is a piano in the song.

""A piano typically has three strings tuned identically corresponding to each note, and a hammer hits them. So perhaps those three frequencies could come from a single note on the piano.""

Dr Brown ran down to his local music store to test if his hunch was true.

""Before I got thrown out of the store by the manager, I managed to determine yes, it was possible, and it actually told me a little deduction about the piano used in the Abbey Road Studios to record that chord.

""It told me that it was a mid-sized grand piano, as opposed to a much larger grand piano, because of where where that note sits.""

Those missing F frequencies, Dr Brown concluded, came from a single note played on a mid-sized grand piano.

The final piece slid into place: buried deep in the mix of that shimmering opening chord, someone — maybe Ringo, but probably George Martin — had played an F on a piano.

Dr Brown remembers that moment very clearly. The feeling that he'd just solved a Beatles mystery — one that had been buzzing around his subconscious brain for decades.

""It was extraordinarily exciting. The chord was a mystery for such a long time, and people still talk about it,"" he said.

""I think that maybe one of the legacies of the Beatles' music is the brilliance of what they put into their songs, on so many levels, so that people 40-50 years later will still be analysing them, still trying to figure out what made them so great."""

The stage is set for the 157th running of the Melbourne Cup. Explore our interactive guide to the horses chasing Australian racing's greatest prize.

$26: 1. Hartnell

Hartnell has arguably been Australia's best horse over the past two seasons — excluding the great mare Winx of course!

The former European-trained galloper will be running in his third Melbourne Cup on Tuesday after finishing 15th in 2015 and third when favourite last year.

He began his spring campaign with a victory in the PB Lawrence Stakes (1,400m) but was then no match for Cup rival Humidor in the Makybe Diva Stakes (1,600m) at Flemington.

The seven-year-old then finished second behind top New Zealand mare Bonneval in the Underwood Stakes (1,800m) before striking plenty of trouble when ninth in the Caulfield Stakes (2,000m).

The decision to step up Hartnell over the 3,200 metres in the Cup came as somewhat of a surprise, but one thing is for sure — his trainer's grandfather knew a thing or two about training Cup winners.

$8: 2. Almandin

Age, sex 8yo gelding Starts 15 (6 wins, 5 placings) Prize money $4,262,558 Trainer Robert Hickmott Jockey Frankie Dettori Last 5 starts 1st, 1st, 2nd, 1st, 4th This track 5 starts (3 wins) Barrier 14 This distance 1 start (1 win) Weight 56.5kg Odds $8 Breeding Germany

It's been almost 80 years since an eight-year-old won the Melbourne Cup, and that's a piece of history Almandin is looking to rewrite on Tuesday.

But the reigning Cup champion is lightly raced for his age and has an enviable record over distances of 2,400 metres and beyond.

Almandin has raced just three times since his triumph last November and looked to be as good as ever with a dominant win carrying 61 kilograms over 2,500 metres at Flemington in September.

He then started a short-priced favourite in the Bart Cummings (2,500m) but laboured into fourth under another big weight behind Cup rival Amelie's Star.

Owner Lloyd Williams and trainer Robert Hickmott plotted the same path for Almandin last year and he should be primed to win back-to-back Cups.

He will also have the services of champion jockey Frankie Dettori, who's looking for his first success in the great race at his 16th attempt.

$9: 3. Humidor

Age, sex 5yo gelding Starts 21 (6 wins, 9 placings) Prize money $2,459,915 Trainer Darren Weir Jockey Blake Shinn Last 5 starts 8th, 1st, 3rd, 5th, 2nd This track 4 starts (2 wins, 1 placing) Barrier 13 This distance First start Weight 56kg Odds $9 Breeding New Zealand

Humidor surged towards the top of Cup betting markets after he gave the champ Winx an almighty scare when running a close second in the Cox Plate just over a week ago.

If the former New Zealand galloper reproduces anything like that performance on Tuesday he'll be very hard to beat.

But he is not without his quirks and is often his own worst enemy with a penchant for not running straight when put under full pressure.

Humidor boasts an excellent Flemington record including an Australian Cup win and a dominant victory in the Makybe Diva Stakes this spring when he left Hartnell and others in his wake.

His poor racing manners were then on show when third in the Turnbull Stakes before he ran fifth in the Caulfield Cup (2,400m) when he had excuses.

The five-year-old is unproven over the Cup distance of 3,200 metres but has the services of in-form jockey Blake Shinn.

$31: 4. Tiberian

Age, sex 6yo stallion Starts 17 (6 wins, 4 placings) Prize money $517,000 Trainer Alain Couetil Jockey Olivier Peslier Last 5 starts 1st, 1st, 7th, 1st, 1st This track First start Barrier 23 This distance First start Weight 55.5kg Odds $31 Breeding France

Tiberian may have been bred and trained in France, but he'll have a big group of Australian owners cheering him on in the hope of fulfilling their Melbourne Cup dreams.

The six-year-old has been racing in fine form in Europe, putting together four wins from five starts and proving effective on Good and Soft ground.

His final run before heading to Australia was a narrow victory over 2,500 metres in the Grand Prix de Deauville in late August.

Tiberian is accustomed to running in small fields and it will be interesting to see how he copes against 23 other runners on Tuesday.

His wide barrier draw ensures he'll have plenty of racing room and he has tactical speed to go forward in search of a position near the rails.

It's no mean feat, but Tiberian has one of Europe's best jockeys in Olivier Peslier in the pilot's seat.

$9.50: 5. Marmelo

Age, sex 5yo stallion Starts 11 (3 wins, 5 placings) Prize money $365,165 Trainer Hughie Morrison Jockey Hugh Bowman Last 5 starts 1st, 5th, 2nd, 1st, 6th This track First start Barrier 16 This distance First start Weight 55kg Odds $9.50 Breeding Great Britain

Few people, and certainly no bookmakers, failed to notice Marmelo's powerful finish into sixth in last month's Caulfield Cup (2,400m).

The effort saw him emerge as a leading contender for Tuesday's big race when he's expected to relish the step up to 3,200 metres.

British trainer Hughie Morrison puts the polish on this five-year-old, whose final run before heading to Australia was an all-the-way victory in the Prix de Kergorlay (3,000m) in France.

This race has been used as a stepping stone towards Flemington, and the double was completed by Americain (2010) and Protectionist (2014).

By all reports Marmelo has taken improvement out of his first Australian experience and is primed to run boldly again.

He'll be partnered by champion jockey Hugh Bowman, who'll be hoping to add the Cup to his three Cox Plates won with the mighty Winx.

$18: 6. Red Cardinal

Age, sex 6yo gelding Starts 10 (5 wins, 4 placings) Prize money $460,572 Trainer Andreas Wohler Jockey Kerrin McEvoy Last 5 starts 3rd, 2nd, 1st, 1st, 5th This track First start Barrier 24 This distance 2 start (2 wins) Weight 55kg Odds $18 Breeding Ireland

Andreas Wohler, the German trainer who oversaw Protectionist's triumphant Cup raid in 2014, is back with the lightly raced Red Cardinal.

The six-year-old has missed the placings only once in 10 career starts; it happened to be at his latest start when fifth behind Cup rival Marmelo in the Prix de Kergorlay (3,000m) in France.

Red Cardinal did not handle the track and was suffering a skin allergy on that occasion but Wohler says he still ran in order to keep his Cup campaign on track.

Before that hiccup the horse had scored back-to-back wins including the Belmont Gold Cup (3,200m) in the US, where fellow Cup runners Wicklow Brave and Wall Of Fire were left in his wake.

He was handed no favours with the barrier draw but he'll have the services of Kerrin McEvoy, who is aiming for a third Cup victory after success aboard Brew (2000) and Almandin (2016).

$10: 7. Johannes Vermeer

Age, sex 5yo stallion Starts 14 (4 wins, 6 placings) Prize money $940,080 Trainer Aidan O'Brien Jockey Ben Melham Last 5 starts 7th, 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 3rd This track First start Barrier 3 This distance First start Weight 54.5kg Odds $10 Breeding Ireland

With a little more luck, Johannes Vermeer's record could have painted a far rosier picture following his two Australian starts this spring.

A handy stakes-performed European galloper, Johannes Vermeer surged into Caulfield Cup favouritism with a fast-closing second in the Caulfield Stakes (2,000m) last month.

The five-year-old then allayed any doubts over his ability to run 2,400 metres when he had little luck gaining clear running when third behind Boom Time and Single Gaze in the Caulfield Cup (2,400m) a week later.

Johannes Vermeer must again head into uncharted territory over the 3,200 metres of the Melbourne Cup, but he's been given the ideal barrier to help him conserve energy until the closing stages.

His trainer Aidan O'Brien is one of the all-time greats but he has yet to add a Melbourne Cup to his peerless record.

$61: 8. Bondi Beach

Age, sex 6yo gelding Starts 13 (4 wins, 5 placings) Prize money $562,019 Trainer Robert Hickmott Jockey Michael Walker Last 5 starts 3rd, 3rd, 13th, 9th, 11th This track 4 starts (no placings) Barrier 1 This distance 2 starts (no placings) Weight 54kg Odds $61 Breeding Ireland

This former European-trained gelding will be contesting his third Melbourne Cup on Tuesday, following 16th (2015) and 13th (2016) placings.

Bondi Beach first came to Australia with big wraps after class performances at elite level in England and Ireland for master trainer Aidan O'Brien.

After his Cup failure in 2015, he returned to Europe for a light preparation before again heading Down Under to be beaten almost 11 lengths by Almandin last year.

He then remained in Australia and joined the Lloyd Williams-owned contingent being prepared out of Macedon Lodge by Robert Hickmott.

Bondi Beach has run only twice since the 2016 Cup and was last seen in September when he was well beaten by Almandin over 2,500 metres.

Despite being expeced to start as an outsider, his connections remain confident of a forward showing on Tuesday.

$16: 9. Max Dynamite

Age, sex 8yo gelding Starts 23 (4 wins, 7 placings) Prize money $1,306,007 Trainer Willie Mullins Jockey Zac Purton Last 5 starts 2nd, 3rd, 10th, 9th, 1st This track 1 start (1 placing) Barrier 2 This distance 9 starts (1 win, 4 placings) Weight 54kg Odds $16 Breeding France

Irish visitor Max Dynamite is back for another shot at the Melbourne Cup after finishing a close second to Prince Of Penzance in 2015.

With a bit more luck that day Max could have won the Cup, but time moves on and he'll be asked to carry a kilogram less than he did two years ago.

Injury has meant the eight-year-old has only raced four times since his last visit to Flemington.

In his only runs this year, Max Dynamite was a well-beaten ninth over the hurdles at Galway in August.

Three weeks later he was back in the winner's circle over 3,400 metres but against modest opposition at Killarney.

It's hardly a classic Melbourne Cup preparation, but never underestimate legendary trainer Willie Mullins whose camp reports Max Dynamite is once again thriving with some Aussie sunshine on his back.

$34: 10. Ventura Storm

Age, sex 5yo stallion Starts 17 (6 wins, 3 placings) Prize money $774,125 Trainer David & Ben Hayes & Tom Dabernig Jockey Glen Boss Last 5 starts 5th, 7th, 6th, 2nd, 13th This track 3 starts (1 placing) Barrier 6 This distance First start Weight 54kg Odds $34 Breeding Ireland

This former British-trained galloper now races with one of Australia's leading stables, and travelled here with impressive credentials.

Ventura Storm raced in elite company, highlighted by a runner-up finish in the English St Leger (2,900m) and victory in the Italian Derby (2,400m).

The five-year-old was brought Down Under with the Cups in mind, and he showed he was on track with a determined second behind Winx in the Turnbull Stakes (2,000m) last month.

He then was considered a leading hope in the Caulfield Cup (2,400m) only to finish 13th behind his stablemate Boom Time.

The stable reported that he pulled up a bit sore from that run but has since recovered well enough to warrant lining up in the big race on Tuesday.

Glen Boss, a three-time Cup winner, takes the ride on Ventura Storm following the suspension of Regan Bayliss.

$51: 11. Who Shot Thebarman

Age, sex 9yo gelding Starts 47 (10 wins, 10 placings) Prize money $3,069,071 Trainer Chris Waller Jockey Tommy Berry Last 5 starts 9th, 4th, 4th, 9th, 1st This track 6 starts (2 wins, 1 placing) Barrier 20 This distance 8 starts (1 win, 3 placings) Weight 54kg Odds $51 Breeding New Zealand

This ageless warrior with an irresistible name for once-a-year punters is back for a fourth attempt at the Melbourne Cup.

Who Shot Thebarman's best result in the race was third behind Protectionist in 2014, and he's lost none of his zest for racing as evidenced by his victory in the Moonee Valley Gold Cup (2,600m) just over a week ago.

Behind him on that occasion were fellow Cup contenders Libran, Cismontane and Big Duke.

It was the veteran's first victory in almost two years but in that time he seldom ran poorly, especially over longer staying trips.

But despite his record Who Shot Thebarman is likely to start at long odds on Tuesday.

He faces the same obstacle as Wicklow Brave in that he'll have to create history and become the first nine-year-old to win the Cup.

$51: 12. Wicklow Brave

Age, sex 9yo gelding Starts 38 (10 wins, 9 placings) Prize money $1,260,788 Trainer Willie Mullins Jockey Stephen Baster Last 5 starts 2nd, 4th, 4th, 4th, 12th This track 1 start (no placing) Barrier 8 This distance 19 starts (7 wins, 3 placings) Weight 54kg Odds $51 Breeding Great Britain

This veteran Irish galloper is back for his second attempt at the Melbourne Cup after finishing down the track (22nd) behind Almandin last year.

Champion trainer Willlie Mullins has had Wicklow Brave in work for most of the year and says his charge continues to race in good heart.

The horse has recent form around Cup contender Rekindling, to whom he finished behind in the Curragh Cup (2,800m) and Irish St Leger Trial.

Wicklow Brave then finished a well-beaten fourth behind top European stayer Order Of St George in the St Leger before travelling to Australia.

He went round at long odds in the Caulfield Cup (2,400m) a fortnight ago and was safely held.

History does not favour a Wicklow Brave victory in the Cup as he must become the first nine-year-old to win the race.

In-form jockey Stephen Baster snapped up the ride on Tuesday after his initial Cup mount Jon Snow was ruled unfit to start by the stewards.

$21: 13. Big Duke

Age, sex 6yo gelding Starts 19 (7 wins, 7 placings) Prize money $1,165,274 Trainer Darren Weir Jockey Brenton Avdulla Last 5 starts 5th, 10th, 2nd, 1st, 4th This track First start Barrier 5 This distance 1 start (1 placing) Weight 53.5kg Odds $21 Breeding Ireland

Big Duke is one of three runners in the Cup for Victoria's leading trainer Darren Weir.

The former European-trained gelding has raced well since arriving Down Under and has wins in the Launceston Cup (2,400m), Manion Cup (2,400m) and the Chairman's Handicap (2,600m) on his resume.

This spring the six-year-old was a close second in The Metropolitan (2,400m) in Sydney before proving too classy in the ATC St Leger (2,600m).

Big Duke then started odds-on in the Moonee Valley Gold Cup but became strung up in traffic and could only manage fourth behind fellow Cup challengers Who Shot Thebarman, Libran and Cismontane.

Weir wasn't particularly impressed by that performance but has nevertheless decided to press ahead to the Melbourne Cup.

Big Duke has drawn ideally in barrier five for Brenton Avdulla, who returns to where he rode a daring race aboard 100-1 shot Lasqueti Spirit to win last year's Victoria Oaks.

$61: 14. US Army Ranger

Age, sex 5yo stallion Starts 12 (2 wins, 5 placings) Prize money $856,333 Trainer Joseph O'Brien Jockey Jamie Spencer Last 5 starts 2nd, 10th, 3rd, 8th, 6th This track First start Barrier 22 This distance 1 start (no placing) Weight 53.5kg Odds $61 Breeding Ireland

US Army Ranger showed great promise as a three-year-old in Europe, where he ran second as favourite in the time-honoured Epsom Derby (2,400m) at only his third career start.

But since then master trainer Aidan O'Brien has been unable to get the best out of the well-bred stallion on race day.

The five-year-old has been tried in various conditions and even contested the marathon Queen Alexandria Stakes (4,350m) at Royal Ascot, where he finished behind Cup rival Thomas Hobson.

O'Brien transferred the training of US Army Ranger to his son Joseph in the hope the change of routine would reignite the old spark.

To that end the horse has been working well since arriving in Australia, but even his connections concede they don't know which US Army Ranger will turn up on Tuesday.

He is part of owner Lloyd Williams' six-strong team seeking his sixth Cup victory.

$26: 15. Boom Time

Age, sex 6yo stallion Starts 32 (7 wins, 9 placings) Prize money $2,459,025 Trainer David & Ben Hayes & Tom Dabernig Jockey Cory Parish Last 5 starts 3rd, 9th, 3rd, 4th, 1st This track 3 starts (2 wins) Barrier 9 This distance 1 start (no placing) Weight 53kg Odds $26 Breeding Australia

Boom Time raced into Melbourne Cup calculations with his surprise victory in the Caulfield Cup (2,400m) just over a fortnight ago.

He saluted at 50-1 after making the most of inside runs navigated by his young jockey Cory Parish to defeat many of his rivals on Tuesday, including placegetters Single Gaze and Johannes Vermeer.

Before that Boom Time boasted decent form but in much lower grades, with his best results being wins at Listed level.

His only run over the Cup distance of 3,200 metres was a well-beaten 11th in the Sydney Cup in April when Parish said the horse didn't handle racing in the clockwise direction.

Boom Time's connections will be hoping he can continue the good performances of Caulfield Cup winners in the Melbourne Cup.

The last horse to complete the famous double was Ethereal in 2001.

$101: 16. Gallante

Age, sex 7yo gelding Starts 19 (4 wins, 4 placings) Prize money $2,007,794 Trainer Robert Hickmott Jockey Michael Dee Last 5 starts 2nd, 7th, 20th, 15th, 7th This track 1 start (no placing) Barrier 18 This distance 2 starts (1 win) Weight 53kg Odds $101 Breeding Ireland

Like most of the horses owned by five-time winner Lloyd Williams, Gallante began his career in Europe.

Since his Australian debut in April 2015, the lightly raced seven-year-old has only won one race — the rich Sydney Cup over 3,200 metres last year.

This will be Gallante's second shot at the Melbourne Cup after finishing down the track (20th) behind his stablemate Almandin in 2016.

He's only had two starts since then, the best of which was seventh, beaten four lengths, in the Geelong Cup (2,400m) a fortnight ago.

Gallante is expected to start one of the outsiders on Tuesday when he'll need a wet track to bring out his best.

Jockey Michael Dee has the ride and is full of confidence after a big-race success at Flemington's Derby Day meeting on Saturday.

$41: 17. Libran

Age, sex 7yo gelding Starts 29 (9 wins, 4 placings) Prize money $1,038,373 Trainer Chris Waller Jockey Dwayne Dunn Last 5 starts 6th, 1st, 6th, 5th, 2nd This track 1 start (no placing) Barrier 7 This distance 2 starts (1 placing) Weight 53kg Odds $41 Breeding Ireland

Libran is the second of champion trainer Chris Waller's two Cup runners this year but is likely to run as one of the outsiders.

The former European-trained galloper put a few wins together in his autumn campaign of 2016 which culminated with a second to Gallante in the Sydney Cup (3,200m).

Fast-forward to autumn this year and Libran's form had gone off the boil before injury curtailed his preparation.

After a spell the seven-year-old showed he was back on track with a fast-finishing victory in the Kingston Town Stakes (2,000m) at Randwick.

But he failed to reproduce that form when sixth in The Metropolitan (2,400m) and then fifth in the ATC St Leger (2,600m) behind Cup rival Big Duke.

However a closing second to stablemate Who Shot Thebarman in the Moonee Valley Gold Cup (2,600m) convinced Waller it was worthwhile having a shot at the Cup.

$34: 18. Nakeeta

Age, sex 7yo gelding Starts 31 (5 wins, 11 placings) Prize money $573,409 Trainer Iain Jardine Jockey Glyn Schofield Last 5 starts 2nd, 10th, 2nd, 4th, 1st This track First start Barrier 19 This distance 1 start (1 placing) Weight 53kg Odds $34 Breeding Great Britain

For the first time, Scotland will have a horse to cheer home in the Melbourne Cup when Nakeeta steps out on Tuesday.

It will be the seven-year-old's toughest test to date, but he should have no issues staying the 3,200 metres and can act on soft ground in case there's some rain about.

Nakeeta comes to Australia on the back of a victory in the rich Ebor Handicap (2,800m) at the York festival in August.

The Ebor has been a good form reference in recent Cup history, with runners-up Purple Moon (2007) and Heartbreak City (2016) taking the race at York before heading to Flemington.

Nakeeta's trainer Iain Jardine was philosophical about coming up with barrier 19 but said his horse was primed to run at his best.

$41: 19. Single Gaze

Age, sex 5yo mare Starts 27 (5 wins, 9 placings) Prize money $2,031,100 Trainer Nick Olive Jockey Kathy O'Hara Last 5 starts 10th, 5th, 4th, 4th, 2nd This track 1 start (no placing) Barrier 11 This distance First start Weight 53kg Odds $41 Breeding Australia

If the tiny mare Single Gaze was to win the Cup, it would be one of the great fairytale stories in the race's history.

What the five-year-old lacks in stature she more than makes up for in determination as she's been consistently tested at the elite level.

Single Gaze is the first Melbourne Cup runner for Canberra trainer Nick Olive and will be the first ride in the race for Kathy O'Hara.

The Sydney jockey has formed a special bond with the mare, having been aboard in 23 of her 27 starts, including wins in the Vinery Stakes (2,000m) and PJ O'Shea Stakes (2,200m).

The pair also finished a gallant second behind Boom Time in the Caulfield Cup (2,400m) a fortnight ago, convincing Olive it was worth having a crack at the Melbourne Cup.

For O'Hara, she will be only the sixth woman to ride in a Melbourne Cup and hopes to emulate Michelle Payne and Prince Of Penzance in 2015.

$13: 20. Wall Of Fire

Age, sex 5yo stallion Starts 14 (4 wins, 3 placings) Prize money $356,570 Trainer Hugo Palmer Jockey Craig Williams Last 5 starts 2nd, 4th, 8th, 2nd, 2nd This track First start Barrier 15 This distance 2 starts (no placings) Weight 53kg Odds $13 Breeding Ireland

Wall Of Fire is rated among the leading contenders for this year's Cup on the back of his strong-finishing second in the Herbert Power Stakes (2,400m) at Caulfield over a fortnight ago.

It's the same lead-up race used by 2014 winner Protectionist and proves that the English-trained five-year-old has travelled well and settled into his new surroundings.

He gets a nice five-kilogram weight drop from his Caulfield run and will be at his peak on Tuesday.

Before coming to Australia, Wall Of Fire contested the Belmont Gold Cup (3,200m) in the US where he finished 8th behind Cup rival Red Cardinal.

Back on softer ground he finished a close second in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes (2,700m), which has been a regular lead-up run for British raiders heading towards the Cup.

Craig Williams has taken the ride on Wall Of Fire as he looks to finally add a Melbourne Cup to his crowded trophy cabinet.

$18: 21. Thomas Hobson

Age, sex 8yo gelding Starts 24 (9 wins, 6 placings) Prize money $376,218 Trainer Willie Mullins Jockey Joao Moreira Last 5 starts 7th, 1st, 2nd, 7th, 2nd This track First start Barrier 21 This distance 5 starts (2 wins, 1 placing) Weight 52kg Odds $18 Breeding Great Britain

The big-striding Thomas Hobson just made it into the field for Tuesday's race much to the relief of his connections.

He's certainly more than just a travel companion for Max Dynamite and Wicklow Brave, as he's shown by his three victories over 4,000 metres and beyond.

Thomas Hobson almost completed the rare feat of winning two staying races over the five days of Royal Ascot; he narrowly failed to add the Queen Alexandria Stakes to his Ascot Stakes victory on day one.

Since then he's stepped up in grade and most recently finished second in the Doncaster Cup over 3,600 metres. Thomas Hobson is another eight-year-old looking to become only the third horse of that age to win the Cup.

One good sign is that the ""Magic Man"" of the saddle, Joao Moreira, lobbied for the ride in a bid to go one better than his narrow defeat aboard Heartbreak City last year.

$14: 22. Rekindling

Age, sex 4yo stallion Starts 9 (3 wins, 2 placings) Prize money $273,308 Trainer Jospeh O'Brien Jockey Corey Brown Last 5 starts 4th, 16th, 1st, 2nd, 4th This track First start Barrier 4 This distance First start Weight 51.5kg Odds $14 Breeding Great Britain

Rekindling is the youngest horse to contest this year's Cup; while he's listed as a four-year-old in Australia, he's actually only three in his native Northern Hemisphere.

He comes to Australia with promising staying form. A month after failing in the Epsom Derby (2,400m) in June, he returned to the winner's circle in the Curragh Cup (2,800m) and defeated Cup rival Wicklow Brave in the process.

He was then far from disgraced when runner-up to top European stayer Order Of St George in the Irish St Leger Trial (2,800m), and had excuses when fourth in the English St Leger (2,900m).

Rekindling looks to be the leading contender of the two runners for trainer Joseph O'Brien, a former jockey and the son of master Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien.

He rounds out the team of six owner Lloyd Williams has in this year's Cup. In the saddle he'll have Corey Brown, a winner aboard in Shocking in 2009.

$18: 23. Amelie's Star

Age, sex 6yo mare Starts 18 (6 wins, 4 placings) Prize money $573,385 Trainer Darren Weir Jockey Dean Yendall Last 5 starts 3rd, 9th, 4th, 1st, 11th This track 3 starts (1 win, 1 placing) Barrier 10 This distance First start Weight 51kg Odds $18 Breeding Australia

This spring Amelie's Star is fulfilling the potential she showed as a younger stayer before a leg injury threatened to end her career in 2015.

Since returning to the track she ran promisingly over shorter, unsuitable distances before booking her place in the Cup with victory in the Bart Cummings (2,500m) a month ago.

That win saw her lower the colours of reigning Cup champion Almandin by more than three lengths and they meet on the same weight terms on Tuesday.

Her final lead-up run saw her start as one of the main chances in the Caulfield Cup (2,400m), but she raced too close to the pacesetters and had nothing left in the straight, weakening into 11th.

A return to Flemington, with a low weight and a more quiet ride, will likely see Amelie's Star show her best.

But it will be no easy feat, with mares winning the Cup just 13 times in more than 150 years, and none since Makybe Diva claimed her third in 2005.

$51: 24. Cismontane

Age, sex 5yo gelding Starts 19 (5 wins, 9 placings) Prize money $424,425 Trainer Gai Waterhouse & Adrian Bott Jockey Beau Mertens Last 5 starts 1st, 12th, 3rd, 3rd, 1st This track 3 starts (1 win) Barrier 17 This distance First start Weight 50kg Odds $51 Breeding New Zealand

Cismontane earned his ticket into Tuesday's big race with a dogged victory in the Lexus Stakes (2,500m) at Flemington on Saturday.

He set a solid speed in the lead and held off all challengers to give trainers Gai Waterhouse and Adrian Bott their lone Cup runner this year.

The five-year-old has been in work for a long time and obviously doesn't lack in toughness.

Before his Lexus win, Cismontane had been stepped up in class and finished third, beaten more than three lengths, behind Cup rival Big Duke in the ATC St Leger (2,600m).

That was followed with another brave effort to narrowly go down behind other Cup challengers Who Shot Thebarman and Libran in the Moonee Valley Gold Cup (2,500m).

Winners of the Lexus often go on to run well in the Cup, with Brew (2000) and Shocking (2009) winning the double.

Al Jazeera,Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal reportedly among 11 princes and several ministers held in anti-corruption probe.,2017-11-04T19:47:00Z,al-jazeera-english,"Saudi Arabia princes detained, ministers dismissed",http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/saudi-ministers-national-guard-economy-dismissed-171104190619900.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/5/ba43f441d0a14844b13461f4de9af534_18.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Saudi Arabia dismissed a number of senior ministers and detained nearly a dozen princes in an investigation by a new anti-corruption committee, state media reported on Saturday.

Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire businessman who owns investment firm Kingdom Holding, was among those held, according to Reuters news agency, citing an unnamed senior official.

The senior ministers who were sacked include Prince Meteb bin Abdullah, the head of the National Guard, and Adel Fakeih, the economy minister.

Abdullah al-Sultan, commander of the Saudi navy, was replaced by Fahad al-Ghafli.

No official explanation was given for the dismissals.

Meanwhile, the official Saudi news agency SPA reported that a new anti-corruption committee had been created by royal decree. Saudi-owned al-Arabiya added that at least 11 princes, four current ministers and several former ministers had been detained in an anti-corruption investigation.

According to al-Arabiya, the new committee, which is headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is looking into the 2009 floods that devastated parts of Jeddah, as well as the government's response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus outbreak.

The reports come just months after Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud replaced his nephew Mohammed bin Nayef with his son Mohammed bin Salman as the kingdom's crown prince.

Mohammed bin Salman has been responsible for pushing through a number of changes both at home and abroad since he became first in line to the Saudi crown.

{articleGUID}

Ian Black of the London School of Economics said the move fit a ""pattern of accelerated change"" since Mohammed bin Salman became heir.

""We've seen since June this year, very far-reaching changes,"" he said, adding: ""That was when Mohammed bin Salman, the son of King Salman, was appointed crown prince.

""Since Mohammed bin Salman became the crown prince in June, we've seen a lot of upheaval. We've seen the announcement of this very ambitious Saudi plan to transform the country the Saudi economy, Vision 2030.""

The dismissal of Meteb bin Abdullah as National Guard minister came shortly after a missile attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on Riyadh's King Khaled International Airport.

However, Black said the two were probably not related as the sacking came bundled with changes to other ministerial portfolios.

In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has announced an end to its long-standing ban on allowing women to drive, and Mohammed bin Salman has also promised to return the country to a ""moderate"" form of Islam.

Since 2015 Saudi Arabia has been at war against Houthi rebels, who control much of northern Yemen on the kingdom's southern border."
Faisal Edroos,Saudi security official says missile fired from Yemen intercepted near the capital's King Khalid International Airport.,2017-11-04T18:24:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Yemen's Houthis fire ballistic missile at Riyadh,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/yemen-houthi-fire-missile-saudi-arabia-riyadh-171104180946302.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/4/6ec8e07f1616462f976ed8c189f0fc1c_18.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for a loud explosion in Riyadh, saying they fired a long-range ballistic missile that travelled more than 800km over the border with Saudi Arabia.

A spokesman for the rebels told Al Jazeera they launched a Burkan 2-H missile - a Scud-type missile with a range of more than 800km - towards Riyadh late on Saturday.

""The capital cities of countries that continually shell us, targeting innocent civilians, will not be spared from our missiles,"" the spokesman said.

Al Masirah, a TV network run by the Houthi rebels, also claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter.

Videos on social media showed smoke rising from an area near Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport.

The official Saudi news agency SPA quoted Colonel Turki al-Maliki as saying that at exactly 8:07pm local time (17:07 GMT), a ballistic missile was fired from Yemeni territory towards the kingdom.

Maliki said Saudi forces used a surface-to-air Patriot missile to destroy the missile, which shattered into fragments in an uninhabited area east of the airport.

He added that there were no reported casualties.

Al Jazeera could not independently verify the reports.

In an interview to Al Jazeera earlier this month, Mohammed Abdul Salam, a spokesman for the Houthi rebels, threatened to to escalate operations on the Yemen-Saudi border and target deep inside the kingdom.

""The Saudis started the war. Our response will continue and increase, whether it's targeting deep inside Saudi Arabia, targeting military positions where Saudi jets fly from or military bases inside Yemeni territory,"" Abdul Salam said.

""Abu Dhabi and others that target Yemen, are as far as we're concerned - a fair military target. Any country that targets Yemen will be struck by our missiles.""

The war in Yemen, the region's poorest country, started in 2014 after Houthi rebels seized control of the capital Sanaa and began pushing south towards the country's third-biggest city, Aden.

Concerned by the rise of the Houthi rebels, believed to be backed by regional rival Iran, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Sunni Arab states launched an intervention in 2015 in the form of a massive air campaign aimed at reinstalling President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government.

In a televised speech on Saturday, he said he suspected there were covert plans to target his life, but he did not elaborate.

Hariri, who made the statement during a visit to Saudi Arabia, said Iran planted ""disorder and destruction"" in the country and meddled in the internal issues of Lebanon as well as other Arab countries.

Referring to Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, Hariri said, ""Iran's arm ... has managed to impose a fait accompli on Lebanon through the power of its weapons"" in the last few decades.

""They have built a state within a state,"" said Hariri from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.

""I say to Iran and its allies - you have lost in your efforts to meddle in the affairs of the Arab world,"" he continued, adding that the region ""will rise again and the hands that you have wickedly extended into it will be cut off.""

Hariri, a leading Sunni politician, has been in office for less than a year, but previously served as prime minister between 2009 and 2011.

He assumed office as prime minister again in December 2016 in a power-sharing government headed by President Michel Aoun, a supporter of Hezbollah, whose members have been charged by the International Court of Justice with assassinating Hariri's father, Rafik, in a 2005 bombing.

The country spent two years in political deadlock without a president before Aoun's election in October 2016, after Hariri endorsed the latter, a move seen by some analysts as a sign of Iran's influence in Lebanon.

His resignation now casts doubt on Lebanon's political future.

Walid Jumblatt, leader of Lebanon's Druze and the Progressive Socialist Party, said Hariri's resignation could adversely affect the country.

He said it was the latest evidence of a power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran and urged intensification of diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions.

""Lebanon is too small and vulnerable to bear the economic and political burden that comes with this resignation,"" Jumblatt said via social media. ""I will continue to call for dialogue between Saudi Arabia and Iran.""

Iranian reaction

Iran's foreign ministry said Hariri's resignation would lead to tension in Lebanon and the region.

In a statement published on the ministry's website, Bahram Qassemi, a spokesman, said: ""The resigning Lebanese prime minister's repetition of the unrealistic and unfounded accusations of the Zionists, Saudis and Americans against Iran is an indication that this resignation is a new scenario for creating tension in Lebanon and the region.

""But we believe that the resistant people of Lebanon will pass this stage easily.

""The sudden resignation of Mr Hariri and his statement in another country is not only surprising and regrettable but is also an indication of his playing a game designed by those who want ill for the region, and the winner of this game is not Arabic or Muslim countries but the Zionists.""

Earlier, Hossein Sheikholeslam, another foreign ministry official, said in a tweet: ""Hariri's resignation was masterminded by #Trump & Saudi Crown Prince #MBS.""

Al Jazeera's Zein Basravi, reporting from Tehran, said: ""The alliance between Hezbollah and Iran is no secret to anyone. It began and flourished in the 1980s when Lebanon was occupied by Israeli military forces.

""In more recent times, Hezbollah has been a key strategic partner for Iran in the conflict in Syria and is an important reason why Bashar al-Assad is still in power in Syria.

""Iran's approach to regional conflicts is to speak softly and carry a big stick, and Hezbollah has been an extension of that stick in Lebanon and Syria.""

Imad Harb, a political analyst at the Arab Center in Washington, DC, said that for Hariri to make the announcement in Riyadh ""basically means he can't have control over his government or his country.

""Hezbollah has been in control of the Lebanese state for quite a while and now it's a supposed victory in Syria on the side of the Syrian regime,"" Harb told Al Jazeera, referring to Hezbollah's role in fighting alongside forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has slowly taken back control over his country following a six-year civil war.

""This has definitely affected Hariri's decision to resign, I have no doubt that maybe he is afraid for his life.""

'Surprise coup'

Speaking from Beirut, Kamel Wazne, a Lebanese political analyst, told Al Jazeera: ""This is a surprise coup by all measures. Everything was fine within the country.

""There is an election coming up. Everybody is talking about planning for of the economic future of the country, and a call came from Saudi Arabia and everything changed.

""This comes in light of imminent American sanctions against Lebanon, certain threats coming from Israel and escalation by the Saudis.

""I think the prime minister probably caved in to the demands of the Saudis and he declared his resignation from Saudi Arabia. This does not bode very well for the stability of Lebanon."""

COP23, the UN Climate Change Conference, begins on Monday in the German city of Bonn.

In theory the 2017 version should be a wholly uninteresting fortnight of impenetrable text revisions and, to the outsider, unintelligible policy engineering. But then factor in the US president.

In June this year, Donald Trump told the world the US would not be staying in the Paris Agreement, an accord forged in 2015 by all nations bar Nicaragua and Syria. It pledged to hold global warming ""well below 2C"" and aim for a 1.5C limit.

{articleGUID}

Since then Nicaragua has signed up, so the US is now in company only with Syria in its climate vision - a dysfunctional nation ripped apart by war.

There have been concerns as to whether the impending US withdrawal will derail the whole agreement. It certainly has changed the dynamic but perhaps, in a surprising way, it appears to have galvanised the effort to tackle climate change.

Even within the US, cities and states have taken it upon themselves to fight back against the federal scepticism which is reversing President Obama's environmental policies and trying to re-energise coal in the name of jobs.

Take California's governor Jerry Brown, who runs a state which continues to lead in reducing emissions regardless of federal policy. He minimises the negative effects of Trump and is helping fund a US pavilion in Bonn, which will extol the virtues of climate change policy.

On the other hand it is reported the Trump administration will be promoting coal, natural gas and nuclear energy as an answer to climate change at an event at Bonn. They will argue that no credible projection shows fossil fuels meeting less than 40 percent of global energy demand by 2050. This is likely to be a hugely popular event by virtue of the sheer unpopularity of the concept.

Despite Trump, 'we're still doing this'

Meanwhile NGOs will be pacing the floors of the conference halls to try and keep up momentum.

WWF's climate adviser Dr Stephen Cornelius says global unity can be maintained without the White House.

""Clearly America is an important country,"" said Dr Cornelius. ""But you saw when President Trump made his announcement in June, you had a lot of countries standing up saying 'we're still doing this'.

""So even without the federal government stepping up to the plate, you have national actors prepared to do so.""

Clearly America is an important country. But you saw when President Trump made his announcement in June, you had a lot of countries standing up saying 'we're still doing this' Dr Stephen Cornelius, WWF climate adviser

However you feel about climate change, this has been an extraordinary year of weather.

Warming oceans have fuelled the fury of unprecedented hurricanes and cyclones across the world. There have been raging wildfires, flooding and heatwaves.

The science of attribution is still being developed but a trend appears to be emerging of bigger, more destructive events.

'Still emitting far too much'

And that is of particular to concern to low-lying Fiji, which holds this year's presidency of the climate conference.

As sea levels rise, Fiji officials will be pressing for the big emitters to step forward and quite simply offer more in the global effort to tackle climate change.

Ultimately this conference will try to formulate a rulebook on how to proceed and actually implement the Paris Agreement in the year 2020.

Time is of the essence say the experts.

Trump may not be listening but let us leave the last word to Erik Solheim, head of the United Nations Environment Programme, who puts it simply.

""The numbers don't lie. We are still emitting far too much and this needs to be reversed."""
Stephanie Sugars,Legal experts and rights groups argue Trump's call to 'terminate' programme after Tuesday's attack is an 'overreaction'.,2017-11-04T20:41:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Groups slam Trump's call to end Diversity Visa Program,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/groups-slam-trump-call-diversity-visa-program-171104204113248.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/4/ad3a6d6f434c455c9ef6a2613a67fe6f_18.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Rights groups and legal experts have slammed US President Donald Trump's call to end the Diversity Visa Program after Tuesday's attack in New York City, saying his remarks are ""rash"" and a ""vast overreaction"".

Trump called for the end of the programme, which awards green cards to about 50,000 people every year, after Uzbek national Sayfullo Saipov allegedly drove a rented truck down a crowded bike path in New York, killing eight people and injuring at least a dozen others.

""The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program'"", Trump tweeted on Wednesday, adding that he wants a ""merit based"" programme instead.

A day later he said he was calling on Congress to ""terminate"" the programme, saying its ""applicants are randomly selected in a random lottery and the people put in that lottery are not that country's finest.""

But immigration rights groups and legal experts say labelling the programme as a strict lottery is ""misleading"", and punishing millions for the actions of one individual is ""insane"".

What is the Diversity Visa Programme?

Congress created the Diversity Visa Program under the 1990 Immigration Reform Act to aid populations that were underrepresented among US immigrants, Antonio Meloni, executive director of Immigration Advocacy Services, told Al Jazeera.

Aimed initially at increasing the immigration of Irish nationals, immigrants of European origin were the primary recipients of diversity visas. Gradually this has shifted to those of African origin, who receive, on average, 40 percent of available visas, according to a Congressional Research Service study in 2011. Only those from eligible countries - those that have sent less than 50,000 immigrants in the past five years - are able to apply.

{articleGUID}

In some years up to 16 million people have applied for the programme. About 100,000 applicants are selected from this pool, but only half will ultimately receive green cards, according to Meloni.

He added that the process of applying is more complex than the first step - filing an online application - would suggest.

""It's not as if you win the lottery and you come in,"" Meloni said.

Individuals applying this year during the one-month application period from October 18 to November 22 must provide documentation showing they have completed 12 years of education or two years of work.

This may not seem like much, Anu Joshi, director of immigration policy at the New York Immigration Coalition, said, ""but for a lot of people in other parts of the world, it's not that easy to prove, to get all of the documents"".

""Winning"" the lottery is no guarantee. Those selected must then apply during the second year for a visa and begin the same marathon of vetting procedures, including background checks and medical examinations all residency applicants undergo. Only 7 percent of recipients can come from any one state, further limiting the chances of those from countries with large applicant pools, according to Meloni.

In regards to the risks to national security, Joshi told Al Jazeera that calling the diversity visa process a ""lottery"" is ""misleading"".

{articleGUID}

""Sure, diversity applicants throw their names into this pool, and if they get selected, that's the lottery part,"" Joshi said.

""After that, everything is the same as anyone else who is trying to emigrate to the United States … They face all of the same barriers in terms of national security threats.""

It is typically not until the third year that candidates are interviewed by the US Department of State or consulates before their visas can be issued, Meloni added.

Who applies for the Diversity Visa Program?

Since its founding, well over one million immigrants have been admitted to the US through the diversity visa programme, Meloni said.

Applicants from around the world, whether applying alone or with their families, do so with the same aim: To try to make a better life for themselves and their families, according to rights groups.

The majority of residency visas are granted on the basis of family ties, Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, told Al Jazeera.

{articleGUID}

As a result, the diversity visa is ""a gated pathway to the United States that they might not otherwise have"", Tsao said.

Other legal pathways to US immigration are through employment, asylum or refugee resettlement, which are difficult to attain and time-intensive. The diversity visa lottery remains the most desirable prospect, particularly for immigrants from Africa or Asia, Tsao explained.

A third of immigrants from Africa come to the US with a diversity visa, according to the US Department of State.

While the programme may not take the form Trump imagines for a merit-based system, Amaha Kassa, founder and executive director of African Communities Together, told Al Jazeera that he believes the ""stringent requirements"" and challenge of navigating the process of the diversity visa process ""select for higher-educated people"".

African immigrants, who enter the country through a variety of ways, have higher educational achievement than both the overall immigrant and overall US populations, according to a Pew study of census data from 2013.

Diversity visa recipients also have less than half the unemployment rate of other green card holders, and more than twice as many are employed in professional or managerial positions, a 2011 Congressional Research Service report found.

'Won't stand by'

President Trump's recent call to end the diversity visa lottery is not the first time the programme has been challenged since it was implemented.

{articleGUID}

The 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service addressed concerns that the programme was vulnerable to fraud and the difficulty of conducting background checks in some of the countries where applicants live. In 2013, a bill that would have terminated the programme passed in the US Senate, but was ultimately rejected in the House of Representatives.

Earlier this year, Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas introduced the RAISE Act, which would save the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy, but at the expense of the visa lottery programme.

Cotton argued in August that cutting immigration in half and prioritising highly-skilled immigrants would ""spur economic growth and raise working Americans' wages"".

Immigrant community organisations are not standing idly by, Kassa told Al Jazeera.

""My organisation and other African community organisations, we would and we will oppose any bill - such as the RAISE Act - that would eliminate the diversity lottery,"" Kassa said.

Trump, however, continues to advocate for redirecting immigration policy to focus on merit-based visas as a measure to improve domestic security.

The response has led to heightened concerns among recipients of diversity visas, who feel villainised despite having followed procedure to enter the US legally, Kassa said.

Immigration Advocacy Services' Meloni told Al Jazeera that the inclusion of a merit-based system would not be a detriment, but also would be no replacement for the diversification provided by the lottery programme.

Whatever path immigration reform takes, Kassa told Al Jazeera, it should not be undertaken rashly or in reaction to an isolated tragedy.

""We're now reacting to one out of those over a million people who were admitted through this programme. Our view is that we should be making policy based on the million, not based on the one,"" Kassa said."

They are known as the stateless. People who have neither citizenship nor a nationality.

Often it means they have no travel documents, find it difficult to get a job, and are denied access to medical care and other state services. Their plight is highlighted in a report by the UN.

The most widely covered case in recent months has been Myanmar's Rohingya community. It became officially the largest stateless minority in the world after Myanmar passed a law in 1982 that denied the Rohingya citizenship.

Until August, there were about one million Rohingya in Myanmar, but more than half of them are now in Bangladesh after fleeing a military crackdown.

But why, in 2017, are so many people in this position? And what can be done about it?

1. The Trump-Russia probe just got real

It was the moment everyone suspected was coming. Some just wondered who and when. On Monday, the first shoe dropped in what will undoubtedly be a series of indictments in the investigation over whether or not the presidential campaign of Donald Trump colluded with Russia.

US Special Counsel Robert Mueller announced the indictments of two former campaign staffers on 12 counts, including conspiracy against the United States, money laundering, making false statements and failure to report bank accounts.

Paul Manafort chaired the campaign during a critical time in the nomination process, overseeing the convention where Trump became the Republican nominee for president. Manafort's colleague and partner, Rick Gates, was also indicted.

According to the court filings, the pair hid ""tens of millions of dollars"" from their work in Ukraine from 2006 through at least 2016 by laundering ""the money through scores of US and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts"". Prior to joining the campaign, Manafort often worked for the pro-Russian government of Victor Yanukovych.

{articleGUID}

Manafort's lawyer reiterated on Monday that his client never colluded with Russia and his, ""was seeking to further democracy and to help the Ukrainians come closer to the United States"".

The White House asserts the two men's activities occurred outside their duties with the campaign.

There was no mention of the Trump campaign in the indictment.

Who is George Papadopoulos?

There were plenty of mentions of the Trump campaign in the third indictment of a relatively unknown Trump adviser.

The curious case of George Papadopoulos has raised concerns that he has valuable information the special counsel is now using to get to others from the Trump campaign.

On October 5, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to investigators. That information was sealed until Monday.

Papadopoulos was a foreign policy adviser who joined the Trump campaign in March 2016.

Trump himself praised him as ""an excellent guy"".

{articleGUID}

Papadopoulos once appeared on Trump's website at a national security roundtable meeting with the candidate.

According to Mueller, Papadopoulos presented himself to the Trump campaign as someone who had contacts in the Kremlin and reportedly said the Russians had ""dirt"" on Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton.

He offered to act as a go-between with Moscow. At least one senior campaign staffer, according to the court documents, encouraged Papadopoulos to go to Russia to meet officials, ""if it is feasible"".

Trump dismissed Papadopoulos as ""a liar"" on Twitter and the White House has painted him as a volunteer who attended one meeting with Trump and was quickly brushed aside.

Unbeknownst to the White House before Monday, however, is that Papadopoulos has been working with investigators and is described by Mueller as a ""proactive cooperator"". Stay tuned.

Sam Clovis becomes a casualty of the investigation

He was a fixture on the Trump campaign early on and an important strategist for a man seeking wins in key states. But Sam Clovis, a top Trump adviser, also became a victim of the Mueller indictments this week.

On Thursday, he officially withdrew his nomination as chief scientist for the US Department of Agriculture after his lawyer confirmed he was the ""campaign supervisor"" named in the Papadopoulos case.

{articleGUID}

According to the documents, the supervisor was in touch with Papadopoulos after his meetings with Russians and told him he had done ""great work"".

The nomination of Clovis was also under heavy scrutiny because he lacked any real qualifications, listing his level of experience in natural sciences as ""none"". His controversial views on climate change, racism and the public education system also raised concerns among Democratic congressmen who had already slowed his nomination.

2. Democrats 'rigged' the system in favour of Hillary

In a scathing hit piece in the publication, Politico, the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) interim chair confirmed what many people suspected: the Democratic nomination for president was rigged in Hillary Clinton's favour.

Donna Brazile took over the chair in July 2016 and found a party deeply in debt but more importantly, completely rigged to ensure Clinton would get the nomination no matter what. According to Brazile, under a legal agreement signed a year earlier, the party was required to divert money to the Clinton campaign and away from other candidates, including her biggest opponent, Bernie Sanders.

{articleGUID}

""This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party's integrity,"" she wrote.

Brazile also wrote that she had to mentally prepare for a phone call to deliver the news to Sanders who contested Clinton all the way to the convention in July 2016.

The Brazile revelations have only emboldened Trump's attacks on Clinton, whom he once promised to throw in jail.

""At some point, the justice department, and the FBI,"" he Tweeted Friday, ""must do what is right and proper.""

3. Trump's double standards on attacks

Within two hours of Tuesday's horrific truck attack in New York City, Donald Trump took to Twitter to condemn it as a ""terrorist"" incident.

Police said Saipov Sayfullo, an Uzbek national, carried out the attack in ""the name of ISIS"", referring to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

{articleGUID}

Saipov, 29, came to the US legally in 2010.

That was all the ammunition Trump needed to launch a 24-hour political offensive on immigrants and foreigners including a promise to shut down the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, signed into law by former Republican President George HW Bush. He also said he would consider sending Saipov to US-run detention prison at Guantanamo Bay.

Many people pointed out the stark contrast to his reaction to other attacks by white assailants in which the president's reactions were muted and or cautious, even less political.

Following a shooting in Las Vegas by a white man just a few weeks earlier, in which 59 people were killed, and 500 others injured, Trump repeatedly cautioned anyone calling for gun control regulation.

""That's for - at a later time,"" he said three days after the shooting.

{articleGUID}

Others also pointed to his response to the killing of a woman at a counterdemonstration during a white supremacist rally in August.

Heather Heyer, 32, was killed after a man with ties to a white supremacist group allegedly rammed his car into a group of anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Trump blamed ""both sides"" for the violence. Even when he denounced the attack, he said ""there were very fine"" people among the white supremacists and counterprotesters.

4. Trump's Chief of Staff John Kelly 'rewrites' Civil War history

The US Civil War from 1860-1865 has always hung over American racial politics.

But following a march in August by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia - sparked by the decision to tear down Civil War monuments - the conflict has fuelled a number of back-and-forth debates over its legacy by the Trump administration and the media.

{articleGUID}

On Monday, Trump's chief of staff, General John Kelly, ignited that debate again. In an interview with Fox News, Kelly said the Civil War - in which the southern Confederate Army took up arms to preserve the institution of slavery - was the result of a ""lack of compromise"".

Critics blasted Kelly for wondering aloud if he was suggesting the US should have compromised on the issue of slavery. Many accused the chief of staff of ""rewriting"" history.

Kelly also referred to Confederate Army General Robert E Lee as ""an honourable man"".

The White House did not back down after Kelly's remarks

""I am not going to get up here and relitigate the Civil War,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Tuesday.

""If some individuals engaged had been willing to come to some compromises on different things, then it may not have occurred.""

5. Trump heads to Asia

It will be Trump's longest foreign trip so far - a 12-day excursion to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

{articleGUID}

On Friday morning, the US president took off for a region that has been a major focus of his ire.

In August, Trump set off alarm bells throughout Asia when he told reporters that any attempts by North Korea to develop a nuclear warhead would be met ""with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before"".

Officials say Trump will reiterate his tough talk in Seoul next week while visiting a memorial to Americans who died on the peninsula in the Korean conflict of the 1950s.

Trump will also raise the issue of perceived unfair trade practices by China while in Beijing.

But all eyes will be on him when he meets Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Manila for the first time. Duterte rejected an invitation from Trump to visit the White House and criticised US congressmen for condemning his reported human rights abuses.

""I've seen America and it's lousy,"" Duterte said in July."

His name was Charles Byrne. Born in Northern Ireland's County Derry in 1761, he now occupies a glass cabinet surrounded by anatomical and zoological specimens in the Hunterian Museum inside the Royal College of Surgeons, London. His residence is the subject of fierce debate between those who wish to protect the lifesaving quality of his DNA and those who advocate for the burial that he was denied.

Byrne, third from right, with George Cranstoun - a dwarf, and three other men [Wellcome Images]

Byrne stood at the towering height of seven feet and seven inches - tall enough to light his pipe from street lanterns. Undiagnosed during his lifetime, Byrne suffered from a benign tumour in the pituitary gland of his brain which prompted an excess of somatotropin, also known as human growth hormone.

His stature propelled him. In his late teenage years, he travelled across the Irish Sea to England to seek his fortune as a human curiosity, oblivious to the macabre ending that would befall him.

By the time Byrne's one-man circus arrived in London, his reputation had preceded him and paying crowds clamoured for an audience with the eloquent and elegantly-dressed giant who exhibited himself in an apartment above a cane shop near Trafalgar Square.

Within weeks, Byrne was feted by assorted members of high society, among them a man that would help define Byrne's legacy, for better or worse.

Death and deceit

Scottish-born John Hunter was one of the most esteemed surgeons of 18th century Britain who pioneered an approach of rigorous experimentation and observation. He made important contributions to the studies of anatomy, physiology and pathology. He also developed an attraction to Charles Byrne, although it is unknown if Hunter ever visited him personally.

After a year's performing in London, Byrne's finances flourished, but his health was deteriorating as the pain of his untreated gigantism persisted. To compound his misery, his savings - which he unwisely kept on his person when drinking in a tavern one evening - were pick-pocketed.

Following this episode, Byrne became severely dispirited, compounded by the worsening pain of his condition.

In June 1783, he died aged 22.

Hunter boiled Byrne's body, drained all tissue and fat, and years later would unveil his newest exhibit to the world - the skeleton of the Irish Giant which now stands in a glass cabinet, the centrepiece of the museum that bears Hunter's name

He had contracted tuberculosis and had other complications arising from his gigantism; it was also reported he had been drinking to excess.

Knowing he was dying, Byrne reportedly instructed his friends to bury his body at sea in a lead coffin. He was terrified was he of being anatomised and displayed in a museum, subject to curiosity even in death.

But London's surgical community was quick to act. On June 5, 1783, the Morning Herald newspaper observed a crowd of surgeons ""surrounding [Byrne's] house just as Greenland harpooners would an enormous whale"". However, none were as prepared as Hunter to obtain Byrne's body. Through intermediaries, Hunter made repeated offers of vast sums of money for Byrne to sell him his body upon death, all of which Byrne refused.

The surgeon then bribed one of Byrne's associates who, with a henchman hired by Hunter, opened the coffin and replaced the body with large rocks. They carted the cadaver back to London while Byrne's friends slept.

Hunter boiled Byrne's body, drained all tissue and fat, and years later would unveil his newest exhibit to the world - the skeleton of the Irish Giant which now stands in a glass cabinet, the centrepiece of the museum that bears Hunter's name.

Historian Wendy Moore, author of The Knife Man, a biography of Hunter, told Al Jazeera that although body-snatching was common in London, Hunter overstepped the boundaries.Why Hunter hid the skeleton so long remains a mystery, some say it was guilt, while others say it took time to assemble. Much of Hunter's collection remained largely private, so it was not unusual to limit public access to an exhibit.

""I think initially he was motivated by scientific curiosity of the giant, particularly because he was trying to understand how life on Earth first began and was interested in any deviation from the norm,"" she said. ""But it was clear that the giant was going to be a trophy for his museum too. He couldn't help himself; he let his collecting mania get hold of him.""

Medical ethicists weigh in

This perceived historical injustice has prompted medical ethicists and other campaigners to lobby the museum to honour Byrne's wishes.

""I became sympathetic to the view that his remains had not been given posthumous respect,"" Thomas Muinzer, a doctor and legal lecturer at the University of Stirling, told Al Jazeera.

""There is enough evidence to conclude that Charles didn't want his body to be snatched and put on display. The Edinburgh Evening Courant reported at the time that Byrne would be carried to Margate to be thrown into the sea 'agreeable to his own request'.""

The Hunterian Museum, which is currently closed for refurbishment, has consistently defended displaying Byrne's remains, citing the absence of direct evidence of his burial wishes. In 2011, trustees of the Hunterian Museum Brendan rejected calls by Muinzer and others to liberate Byrne's skeleton.

""The Hunterian Collecting Trustees consider that the educational and research benefits of exhibiting Byrne's remains merit their retention,"" a spokesman told Al Jazeera.

A key figure in the establishment of post-mortem examinations, Hunter's thirst for knowledge required a constant supply of bodies to cut and probe.

In his time, people tended not to leave their bodies to science, so Hunter had little recourse but to acquire his cadavers from the overflowing cemeteries of London, often obtaining bodies of paupers and criminals.

For this, he maintained a web of undertakers, policemen, coroners and grave robbers on his payroll who would inform him of the latest corpses interred. Most coveted were those of abnormal size or with deformities; they would be delivered by horse and carriage to the courtyard of Hunter's home.

These men, ""The Resurrectionists"", were widely feared, including by Byrne, who, hailing from rural Ireland was likely to have been an observant Christian. Such was the literal belief in the dead rising from the grave on the Day of Judgement that any interference with a corpse was thought to compromise a person's acceptance into heaven.

A distinguished doctor and well-respected member of society by day, by night, an obsessive character that liaised with the underworld - it is no surprise a contemporary of Hunter was Robert Louis Stevenson, author of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

Descriptions of Jekyll and his home bear a strong resemblance to the Scottish surgeon and his Leicester Square townhouse.

'Byrne is in the folk consciousness'

Muinzer's growing interest led him to Byrne's rural homeland to conduct field research, roaming the villages and pubs interrogating the locals about the giant's legacy.

""Byrne is in the folk consciousness of the older generations who were brought up with his story,"" Muinzer says.

""He used to be associated with a local heritage site called the Giants' Grave, so-called because they say Byrne laid down at that site and said: 'When I die I want to buried here'. As he lay there, his friends dug a trench around him, so it made a silhouetted imprint of a man in the earth.""

Marta Korbonits, doctor and professor of endocrinology at Queen Mary University, London, established the genetic commonality of pituitary gigantism in 2006 after she noticed her patients were all natives of a precise area of mid-Ulster, Northern Ireland.

""Consider genetics as a book and every letter is a building block of a gene. A mutation is like one misspelling in the book - the Irish families I met had the same misspelling, imagine the mathematical possibility of this. Clinically the picture began to come clear,"" Korbonits told Al Jazeera.

You have to accept the social values of 1780s London - this was a time when live human beings were bought and sold, so it didn't seem that buying and selling dead bodies was such a big deal Marta Korbonits, doctor and professor of endocrinology at Queen Mary University

""Suddenly I remembered there is this famous Irish giant in the museum around the corner and thought, 'Could there be a link?'""

Korbonits subsequently persuaded the Hunterian to allow her to send samples of Byrne's teeth away for DNA tests. The results showed that the part of Ireland Byrne came from was a ""giant hotspot"", and her team embarked on a population screening there to promote early treatment for carriers of the genetic mutation.

""It's strange to see a human skeleton in a glass case with lights on him,"" said Korbonits. ""You wonder, 'is that how I would like to end up?' On the other hand, I am the beneficiary of his experience through the DNA research, so it is mixed feelings.

""I don't suppose anyone wants to end up the way he did since he fully expressed his wishes that he be buried at sea. But I think you have to accept the social values of 1780s London - this was a time when live human beings were bought and sold, so it didn't seem that buying and selling dead bodies was such a big deal.""

""I believe it would be possible to make a replica of the skeleton, and personally I think Byrne should have his wish and his body [be] buried at sea now. I think it's the right thing to do,"" said biographer Wendy Moore

Such an act would not be without precedent.

In the last decade, the Maori community has arranged a series of repatriations of bones that were seized by American and European anthropologists centuries ago and exhibited in museums and private collections to their ancestral homeland of New Zealand.

Korbonits claims that it is impossible to know what more Byrne's remains may be able to tell us.

""If reports from the time are correct, then what happened to Byrne's body is unacceptable. But I would be very short-sighted and full of myself if I claimed that I discovered everything that needs to be known from the remains and there is nothing left to be found.""

But for hardliners such as Muinzer, the mere act of displaying Byrne is an outrage.

""The Royal College of Surgeons says that he is of great value to medical science but that doesn't presuppose that you need to display the remains as a curiosity piece, or as a freak exhibit as I have heard it described, in the memorial museum to the person who is responsible for the theft of the remains.""

Among specimens such as mummified remains, Winston Churchill's dentures and the rectum of a former Bishop of Durham, Byrne's haunting skeleton stands in the centre of the museum. A bust of John Hunter is perched on a shelf above, watching over him, their fame forever intertwined.

The museum confirmed to Al Jazeera that Byrne's skeleton would remain on display upon its reopening.

'Giant' genetic relative speaks out

Brendan Holland, 65, admits some ""creepy similarities"" between his life and Byrne's. Both grew up around 10 miles from each other, moved to London as young men and worked near Trafalgar Square - in Holland's case as a civil servant in the ministry of agriculture.

Holland stands at over six feet and nine inches tall and has since discovered he is a genetic relative of Byrne after research into pituitary gigantism found a genetic link.

If keeping the skeleton plays a small part in looking after those people and curing them as soon as possible, then it's a small price to pay Brendan Holland, genetic relative of Charles Byrne with gigantism

Speaking to Al Jazeera by telephone, Holland explained how living with gigantism was a daily struggle before he sought treatment at the age of 20.

""Apart from the obvious spurt of growth, I was having headaches, tiredness, fatigue and generally feeling unwell and underpowered. It was affecting my whole immune system, and at one stage I contracted tuberculosis. Before medication became available, most men and women affected by this didn't live beyond their mid-twenties.""

Holland, Byrne's genetic relative, says he doesn't want to ""get on [his] moral high-horse"" on the ethical argument and instead highlights the importance of raising awareness of pituitary gigantism.

""We need to expand the public awareness of the condition, particularly where I am from. It's insidious; it can lie dormant for generations and suddenly pops up and presents itself. If keeping the skeleton plays a small part in looking after those people and curing them as soon as possible then it's a small price to pay."""

The political phrase ""all options on the table"", of course, encompasses the possibility that the United States and Japan might jointly launch an aggressive military attack on North Korea, which they would portray as being ""pre-emptive"" in light of the many verbal threats that have already been issued by the regime of Kim Jong-un.

At a personal level, Abe hardly needs Washington to push him into a hardline stance vis-a-vis North Korea (or China or even South Korea for that matter) because his hawkishness towards mainland Asian neighbours has been part of his political trademark throughout his career. At times, he has associated with even some of the more fringe elements of the Japanese hard right.

As critics point out, support for ""all options"" including an attack on North Korea puts Abe in spiritual rebellion to the nation's constitution, which mandates that ""the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes"".

Obviously, ""all options are on the table"" is precisely the sort of threat of the use of force that Japan's post-World War II constitution explicitly bans.

Rewriting the 'Peace Constitution'

{articleGUID}

But Abe's antagonism towards his nation's ""Peace Constitution"" is hardly a new development.

In recent years, he decapitated the independent bureaucratic agency that had traditionally guaranteed legislation's conformity to the national charter. In the summer of 2015, he went on to force passage of new security policy legislation that some 97 percent of independent legal scholars judged to be unconstitutional.

Even expert witnesses handpicked by the ruling party itself shocked the Abe government by denouncing the unconstitutionality of the bills, which were, thereafter, enacted nonetheless.

Finally, on May 3 of this year - the 70th anniversary of the Constitution - Abe announced his intention to revise the pacifist Article Nine in a video message to a meeting of the Nippon Kaigi (Japan Conference).

The venue was significant. Nippon Kaigi is a controversial nationalist organisation seeking not only constitutional change, but also possessing a sweeping right-wing programme of Emperor-centrism, historical revisionism, opposition to female and LGBT equality, and a rollback of the entire Western conception of ""rights"" in favour of enhanced individual ""obligations"" to the state.

While Abe has proven to be slow and methodical since returning to power in December 2012, there is not much doubt that groups such as Nippon Kaigi remain his fundamental political base.

Fresh off his third major general election victory on October 22, which was pulled off mainly via the dramatic implosion of the opposition challenge led by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, Prime Minister Abe is now in a position to move forward his lifelong goal of revising the Constitution.

However, while his ruling coalition holds the necessary two-thirds majority in both houses of the legislature, Abe still faces high hurdles. First, he must get his own fractious Liberal Democratic Party and coalition partner Komeito to reach consensus on a specific word-for-word proposal for rewriting the national charter. That task alone may prove his undoing.

But even if he succeeds on that difficult matter, he still must conduct an unprecedented national referendum in which a majority of voters approve the proposed constitutional change.

The latest poll by Kyodo News finds 52.6 percent of the Japanese public are opposed to Abe's current proposal with only 38.3 percent in support of it. When one also considers the fact the opposition parties will fight a ferocious campaign against revision - as well as the reality that polling shows deep public distrust towards the prime minister personally - the smart money still suggests that Abe will ultimately fail to achieve his dream.

However, Japanese politics are likely to be tied up by these fierce battles over the ""Peace Constitution"" for the next several years. Abe is expected to push forward this issue, even at the cost of his own political life, because he is on the record as a lifelong true believer.

The North's abductions

{articleGUID}

One related matter likely to be highlighted during Trump's visit is that of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea between 1977-1983 - another Abe pet issue by which he initially rode to national prominence from 2001-2006.

North Korea admitted in 2002 to kidnapping Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s to help train its spies in Japanese language and culture.

North Korea has insisted it resolved this issue in 2004 when five surviving abductees and their families (10 people in total) returned from North Korea. Japan has insisted, on the contrary, that Pyongyang has yet to reveal the full truth and that other abductees may still be alive.

Trump is expected to echo the Japanese line on this issue as a demonstration of his political solidarity with Abe.

The broader trajectory of the North Korea crisis remains a question mark. Abe has repeatedly denounced ""talks for the sake of talks"" and called for tougher sanctions on Pyongyang. There has been no indication, however, that he has any realistic diplomatic objective in mind beyond these serial calls for punishment.

Brad Glosserman, senior adviser to Pacific Forum CSIS, echoes many analysts when he observes, ""Kim Jong-un will not give his nukes, period … Kim Jong-un sees them first as instrumental to his regime survival.""

He adds, ""Without nuclear weapons North Korea is nothing.""

There are no serious analysts who believe that economic pressure will induce Pyongyang to disarm itself, even though that is what both the Trump and Abe administrations publicly claim is the objective of their current sanctions policy.

The major wild card without a doubt is Trump. While all other players can be expected to behave in a manner in which they have long been behaving, the unpredictable US president is certainly the most dangerous element of instability.

According to Koichi Nakano, professor at Sophia University, ""for the first time in many years, the Japanese people are not sure whether the United States, and its president in particular, is a force for good - whether it really provides for the safety of the country and the region"".

None of these doubts, however, are expected to be reflected in the shows of mutual friendship and solidarity that Shinzo Abe and Donald Trump will perform for the cameras.

The telecom giants said that they have stopped negotiating and will remain independent entities. The wireless carriers ""were unable to find mutually agreeable terms"" and want to ""put an end to the extensive speculation around a transaction,"" they said in a joint announcement.

Over the past few weeks, numerous merger updates have bubbled up from anonymous sources. Initially, the merger seemed to be a done deal. Merger talks then seemed to break down, only to be revived again a couple days ago.

But none of those rumors were confirmed by the companies' chief executives. That changed today when T-Mobile CEO John Legere and Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure both said that there won't be any deal.

Legere's statement called the prospect of combining with Sprint ""compelling for a variety of reasons."" But T-Mobile won't pursue a deal that doesn't ""result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile's shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record,"" he said.

Claure's statement said the following:

While we couldn't reach an agreement to combine our companies, we certainly recognize the benefits of scale through a potential combination. However, we have agreed that it is best to move forward on our own. We know we have significant assets, including our rich spectrum holdings, and are accelerating significant investments in our network to ensure our continued growth.

US likely would have approved merger

T-Mobile is owned by Deutsche Telekom, and Sprint is owned by SoftBank. The decision to call off merger talks came after a meeting involving the heads of all four companies, according to The Wall Street Journal. SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son reportedly did not want to give up control of Sprint. Earlier reports indicated that Deutsche Telekom would own a majority stake of the combined company if a merger was completed.

Sprint previously abandoned a bid for T-Mobile in 2014 when it became clear that the Obama administration would block the merger in order to preserve the competition created by having four major nationwide carriers. If the companies had struck a deal this year, they would have had a better chance of getting government approval under the Trump administration.

Fighting the Verizon/AT&T duopoly

Because merger talks have been called off, US wireless consumers will continue to benefit from competition among four nationwide carriers as T-Mobile and Sprint challenge market leaders Verizon Wireless and AT&T.

Sprint ""look[s] forward to continuing to take the fight to the duopoly and newly emerging competitors,"" Claure said.

Legere said that T-Mobile has ""been out-growing this industry for the last 15 quarters, delivering outstanding value for shareholders, and driving significant change across wireless. We won't stop now."""

A group of prominent anthropologists have done an overview of the scientific literature and declare in Science magazine that the ""Clovis first"" hypothesis of the peopling of the Americas is dead.

For decades, students were taught that the first people in the Americas were a group called the Clovis who walked over the Bering land bridge about 13,500 years ago. They arrived (so the narrative goes) via an ice-free corridor between glaciers in North America. But evidence has been piling up since the 1980s of human campsites in North and South America that date back much earlier than 13,500 years. At sites ranging from Oregon in the US to Monte Verde in Chile, evidence of human habitation goes back as far as 18,000 years.

In the 2000s, overwhelming evidence suggested that a pre-Clovis group had come to the Americans before there was an ice-free passage connecting Beringia to the Americas. As Smithsonian anthropologist Torben C. Rick and his colleagues put it, ""In a dramatic intellectual turnabout, most archaeologists and other scholars now believe that the earliest Americans followed Pacific Rim shorelines from northeast Asia to Beringia and the Americas.""

Now scholars are supporting the ""kelp highway hypothesis,"" which holds that people reached the Americas when glaciers withdrew from the coasts of the Pacific Northwest 17,000 years ago, creating ""a possible dispersal corridor rich in aquatic and terrestrial resources."" Humans were able to boat and hike into the Americas along the coast due to the food-rich ecosystem provided by coastal kelp forests, which attracted fish, crustaceans, and more.

No one disputes that the Clovis peoples came through Beringia and the ice free corridor. But the Clovis would have formed a second wave of immigrants to the continent.

Despite all the evidence for human habitation, ranging from tools and butchered animal bones to the remains of campfires, scientists are still uncertain who the pre-Clovis peoples were. We have many examples of Clovis technology, with characteristic shapes for projectile points and pottery. But we have no recognizable pre-Clovis toolkit.

That may be about to change, however. The pre-Clovis people traveled along a now-drowned coastline, submerged after the last of the ice-age glaciers melted. New techniques in marine archaeology, ranging from ROVs to underwater lasers, are helping scientists explore ancient submerged villages. A team even turned up a 14,500-year-old campsite in Florida in a blackwater sinkhole last year.

Rick and his colleagues write that the big question now is when pre-Clovis people actually arrived in the Americas. They suggest the arrival could be as early as 20,000 years ago on the verdant kelp highway. Other researchers, however, say people could have arrived during a temperate period about 130,000 years ago. A recent paper in Nature describes what appear to be the 130,000-year-old butchered remains of mastodons in California, along with sharp stones used to deflesh the animals. There is plenty of skepticism in the scientific community about this discovery, but the evidence can't be ignored.

To the best of our knowledge, the kelp highway brought humans to the Americas. Using boats and fishing tools, humans made it all the way from Asia to the Americas, founding many coastal communities along the way. And now for the next debate: who were they, and when exactly did they arrive?

“The Golden Age of TV” has become a cliché: it should almost go without saying that the TV we get in 2017 has a depth and breadth that prior eras simply can’t match. And 2017 in particular could very well outpace recent history, too, given newbies like The Handmaid’s Tale and Star Trek: Discovery joined our DVRs next to new seasons of favorites like Fargo and Twin Peaks.

In a strong year when a great spin-off of an all-time show show brings back its perfect villain and the most-hyped show of today does mindblowing things with freakin’ dragons, it says something that the most fun I’ve had watching TV in 2017 happened in the middle three hours of Stranger Things season two.

The horror returns

Stranger Things has always been an unabashed descendant of two ‘80s Steves: Spielberg and King. Season one captured the zeitgeist in part because it balanced those two impulses so well. We may fondly think of Mike and Eleven getting to know each other in a blanket fort first, but the series started with a scary opening 10 minutes (involving a poor scientist in the Hawkins lab and Will’s first encounter) and had look-away sequences like bullies threatening to stab Mike.

Further Reading Stranger Things 2: The hype strikes back, but the story alliance is ready The opening trio of S2 episodes lean toward the likable Spielberg adventures of yore. The kids need to figure out who upended Dustin’s Dig Dug score; Jonathan tentatively ventures into high school social circles (presumably for a glimpse of Nancy). But when we last left our Hawkins heroes, Dustin had loosed an otherworldly creature, Eleven finally had enough of living in secrecy, and some kind of Upside Down force of darkness descended upon Will. This middle chunk of the season comfortably brings Stranger Things back tonally to the King-iverse.

It starts with that predicament of Will’s. Some kind of Upside Down parasitic being has inhabited his body in ways that complicate his memory and ability to communicate. Each being can essentially see what the other does and listen in on thoughts, but only the Upside Down darkness monster seems capable of manipulating the other. When Joyce tries treating her son like he has an illness by drawing him a warm bath, things get delightfully eerie: “He likes it cold,” says a voice that is Will’s in sound only.

There are other great bits of Stranger Things keepin’ it strange here: Nancy and Jonathan call a meeting with Barb’s parents in a public park seemingly knowing that the Pleasantville-style lab employees posing as civilians would be ready to detain them. Dustin’s mom’s cat meets a fate perhaps popularized in the ‘80s by Alf, not Annie Wilkes or others in that lot. Hopper starts parading around the Upside Down once more. And Joyce Byers’ home yet again gets covered in cryptic junk as she searches for whatever message her son tries to convey. With a cliffhanger in episode six to punctuate it, Stranger Things’ return to its terror roots simply makes these the most engaging episodes to date.

Yet the fun remains

Of course it can’t be all doom and gloom—again, tonal balance proved vital for S1. So in this middle part of S2, the writers room unleashes a couple of old-fashioned (and effective) TV tricks to keep things light even as the darkness keeps expanding. Stranger truths Even with the action in full swing, Stranger Things manages to carry some of its early S2 themes across this midway point. The show continues to use Hawkins Lab (and now Murray) to enhance its commentary on manipulating the truth for the public. When Nancy and Jonathan come face to face with Dr. Owens, they receive a healthy dose of his insistence on censorship. “Men of science have made abundant mistakes of every kind... but the more people like the Hollins know the truth, the more likely such attention becomes a problem. You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading? So we can take care of those weeds there.”

Murray, on the other hand, wants to get the truth out in the world, but he doesn’t think it can succeed on its own merits. In another act stemming from a very 2017-y ethos, he insists on manipulating the message for easier consumption and spread. “It’s not whether I believe it,” he tells Nancy and Jonathan after hearing their Barb story. “It’s them with a capital T—the priest, the postman. People like the curtain. It provides stability and protection.”

Most noticeably, new characters to this universe get to react in meta-commentary ways when they finally came face-to-face with the realities of S1. The boys have spent this entire time keeping Max in the dark about the source of Will’s peculiarity, so when Lucas decides he has to tell Max in order to enlist her help, she sees it as a desperate attempt to win her affection.

What do you think, Lucas asks. Max then speaks for her and the show’s critics: “I liked it, I just felt it was a little derivative in parts,” she says. “I just wish it had more originality.”

The same technique gets applied to eye-opening moments for Bob and “investigative journalist” Murray (Brett Gelman). Bob the Brain has an affection for puzzles, and he’s able to deduce Will’s drawings... which forces Joyce to introduce the family’s recent history sooner than she would like. Soon, Bob is helping her dig Hopper out of another dimension/ditch and being rushed to an ultra-secret hospital facility. “I thought stuff like this only happened in movies and comics books,” he says. “Not in Hawkins, and not to you.”

Murray’s turn gets a bit lighter as he helps a desperate Nancy and Jonathan devise a plan to spread the word on Barb and Hawkins Lab, hopefully causing an uproar that’ll take them down. The two eventually have to spend the night but insist on separate beds. “Lovers’ quarrel?” Murray asks. “You’ve told me a lot of shockers today but that, that is the first lie—you’re young, attractive, you’ve got chemistry and, most of all, shared trauma.”

The most fun sequence in these standout episodes comes from perhaps the oldest trick in the TV playbook: get your most popular-yet-opposite characters together somehow, some way. David Simon’s shows excelled at this (how on Earth does McNulty end up shopping with Omar?), as has Better Call Saul (parsing out Mike and Jimmy moments to make them special every time). So when Dustin can’t find backup in his quest to track down and face Dart—Nancy and Jonathan left town, Lucas had to catch Max up, Will and Mike sit inside the Hawkins’ Lab facilities—he fortuitously stumbles upon one heartbroken young man also knocking at the Wheelers’ door.

I would personally watch an entire 50-minute show of Dustin, uber-nerd tween, and Steve, high school heartthrob, walking down the train tracks and discussing life. For instance, how do you know if a girl likes you?

Steve: “It’s like electricity before the storm...”

Dustin: “Oh, you mean an electromagnetic field... ”

Steve: “No, no no, not like that.”

The two swap hair secrets (“When it’s damp—not wet, damp—do four pumps of the Farrah Fawcett spray”) as they drop chunks of raw meat to set the stage for the Pièce de Résistance sequence of this middle stage of the season.

Crestfallen after Nancy seemingly drops him and still-enigmatically-evil, Billy upstages him in front of the varsity, Steve still has it in him conjure up his heroism and dust off the nail-ridden baseball bat to fight demogorgon babies in a familiar abandoned bus-setting.

The lighting and score work perfectly, and a fog lays on top of the junkyard to only heighten the tension. Things look touch-and-go for several moments, as Dart seems to bring reinforcements forcing Steve to rely on every bit of acrobatics he has. But just as he and the kids manage to sneak into an increasingly fragile-looking bus, demogorgon heads seeming to pop in from every opening, the roars stop. Lucas breaks the silence.

“What happened?”

“Steve scared ‘em off,” Dustin insists.

“No, no way,” Steve says frankly. “They’re going somewhere.”

Somehow, Stranger Things 2 has kept Eleven and Mike separated for more than half the season, and it has yet to unleash a scenario in which all three facets of Hawkins heroes—the core kids, the Nancy-Jonathan-Steve age group, then Joyce and Hopper—work together toward something. Major happenings simply must be on the horizon given how episode six ends: Will’s “true sight” seemed to be used against humanity, Murray has sent out the tapes that will bring down (or at least bring unwanted attention to) Hawkins Labs, and that herd of baby demogorgons left the Steve showdown to go somewhere. It sure doesn’t seem like Joyce, Will, Mike, Hopper, and Bob will want to stick around that lab for very long.

Yet almost regardless of what’s to come or how well Stranger Things 2 can or can’t stick the landing, this three-episode heart of season two ensures this goes down as one sequel that falls squarely on the “success” half of the spectrum. Now, time to head back for episode seven, which, for some reason, has oddly become the one thing everyone keeps asking about first."

Sometimes, you simply need an over-the-top mockumentary about an extremely obscure and non-existent bit of pop culture to shine a light on the absurdity of our current entertainment industry. And as funny as Top Knot Detective will be for a certain kind of niche obsessive, the film works equally as well slinging one-liners about everything from the neverending race to become a content creator to the insanity of a traditional TV crossover.

It's Sutaffu’s world; we just buy in it

In the real world, Apple makes computers, but it also held music festivals and now wants into original TV content. Facebook started with a website for connecting with others, but it tried a phone and now also wants into original TV content. Amazon sold books online and now.... well, you get the idea. Original creative content with the potential to spawn devoted fanbases (and endless sequels, merchandise, marketing opportunities, etc.) has become the must-do corporate activity of today.

In Top Knot Detective’s universe, a company called Sutaffu exists in this orbit. The conglomerate earned notoriety “for making knock-offs of brand name suits” to start, but it grew into an international brand by producing and selling everything from CDs to beer and cigarettes. Naturally after years of sustained economic growth, the execs felt the time had come to enter the television industry. So to shepherd the Sutaffu brand into this new venture, the company turned to a familiar face—Takashi Takamoto, a man who found pop chart success as a Psy-like musician writing Sutaffu jingles.

Luckily for Sutaffu, Takamoto had an idea he’d been sitting on: Top Knot Detective, the story of a samurai rōnin that discovers his master had been murdered and sets out on a quest to find the killer and take revenge. For just a small sample of what kind of plot awaits, consider the lead character, Surei Tatei. His catch phrase involves screaming “Deductive reasoning!,” he can punch people’s heads off and turn invisible, and he drops sweet mid-battle one-liners like this one (uttered after stabbing a villain in the eye):

Villain: “That was my good eye! Now you will finally see my justice…” Tatei: “See my fist!”

Without venturing into spoiler-territory, the show evolves over time and has its fair share of off-camera drama (“The first time he was arrested, we thought the show was over—but his popularity grew more than ever!” another interviewee says of Takamoto). But if you grew up on something like Power Rangers, Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad, or Ultraman, this mockumentary reveals a show piece-by-piece that will make you grin ear-to-ear.

Top Knot Detective

That's show biz

Again, the meta-commentary second-level of Top Knot Detective is where this film truly shines. Beyond Sutaffu as a predecesor for the ever-expanding corporations of today, Takamoto does the same for our present showrunner-love era. He writes, directs, produces, and stars in the fictional series—”you can look at him as the Ed Wood of Japanese samurai TV,” says one interviewee. “That’s a compliment.”

As you might expect from other recently high-profile instances of creator as single aueteur (say Nic Pizzolato on True Detective S2, Sam Esmail on Mr. Robot S2, etc.), things go off the rails a bit creatively. Plots get tossed in favor of artistry (“We shot lots of great scenes, so we need to combine them into one great thing,” Takamoto explains at one point), and Top Knot Detective happily engages in ultra-fan service to save its critical face. At one point, Sutaffu urges Takamoto to create a crossover episode with the super popular Supersentei Timestryker, a series centered around a Japanese baseball player that suffered an accident and was then rebuilt to defend Earth. “That show is for babies, it has no substance,” Takamoto would later say. “If you mess with time, bad things will happen to you? Babies.” The crossover episode obviously proves to be a ratings bonanza, one of Top Knot’s highest rated endeavors in years.

Given Sutaffu's wide-reaching business tentacles, Top Knot Detective naturally became a pioneer in the area of native content and product placement, too. Takamoto writes Ronin Surei Tatei to relax after killing a villian through Sutaffu cigarettes or a cold beer. He prepares to stomp another enemy’s head by pausing to reach for then prime his Sutaffu high-top pumps. “I will wipe you from history like a bowel movement,” Tatei cries before Sutaffu-soft bathroom tissue factors into the episode. Such campaign work has long become fodder for the likes of Austin Powers or Community, and nowadays the evolution of that concept lives on in special Web series or branded video. Further Reading Wonder Woman aside, fall’s origin stories include EVs, Dahmer, and Gilbert Gottfried

Top Knot Detective even manages to partially skewer modern rabid fandom, even if the “show” is set well before the Internet could fuel it (like the decoding subreddits of Mr. Robot or Rick & Morty disciples forcing McDonald’s to apologize). It stars with the fan-service show elements above and the audience constantly forgiving Takamoto’s off-camera sins (“I did anything to become famous,” he says. “To spread joy to people I did a lot of stupid things in my life. I regret many of them, but I never killed anyone”).

But throughout the mockumentary, the directors take cameras to various cons across the world where people line up for days just to catch a glimpse of any Top Knot stars. Will they power an inevitable remake, spin-off, or maybe even a six-seasons-and-a-movie style cinematic take? Who knows, but certaily no one speaks to the essence of Top Knot Detective—both the fake TV series and fake documentary—quite like its fanbase.

“Objectively it’s a terrible show,” one dedicated show blogger concludes. “The acting’s really shitty, there’s a ton of continuity errors—the whole thing doesn’t make any sense. That’s what’s beautiful about it. When you watch a lot of movies and TV, you get bored, jaded, and you see the same stuff over and over again. You’re just praying for some kind of weirdness, some real lunacy to grab you, shake you up, and show you something new—that’s Top Knot.”

Top Knot Detective continues to play the film festival scene currently with upcoming screenings in Ithaca, New York and Vancouver, Canada. Follow the team on social media for the latest screenings; the producers have hinted that distribution news may be coming soon.

David Kravets,This column is my first step toward recovering from a maddening return experience.,2017-11-04T11:30:51Z,ars-technica,This is why I’ll never shop at OfficeMax again—even if everything is free,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/this-is-why-ill-never-shop-at-officemax-again-even-if-everything-is-free/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-27-at-10.54.32-AM-760x380.png,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"I've often remarked to anyone who would listen that robots are becoming more like humans, and humans are becoming more like robots.

When it comes to the latter, nowhere is that more true than in my recent dealings with cashiers, managers, and so-called ""customer service"" agents at the merged office-supply powerhouse of Office Depot and OfficeMax.

""I do apologize"" or words to that effect was the robotic mantra I received literally dozens of times when speaking to company employees on the phone, and in person, about OfficeMax's absolutely asinine corporate return policy, and the company's inability to actually carry out that asinine corporate return policy.

I am writing this as my first step toward recovering from an ordeal that started with the simple task of purchasing a router—a common chore that most of us have done, or will do, in the future. And I confess, however, that I lacked the willpower to refrain from being a jerk to most every OfficeMax employee I dealt with. I plead guilty. I literally could not help myself. I had my reasons. But I do apologize.

Mesh Wi-Fi

I am running an old Airport Extreme router from Apple, and I didn't want to be left out of the new consumer mesh Wi-Fi frenzy that everybody, including Ars, is talking about. I suspected my Airport Extreme was failing, as the signal at my California East Bay residence was intermittently turning my normal connection of 500 Mbps down and 20 Mbps up into a crawl.

After reading several reviews, including one here at Ars, I chose the Velop Whole-Home Mesh Wi-Fi product from Linksys. The single unit was advertised everywhere for $199.99. But OfficeMax had it for $179.99.

The first sign that I should have avoided OfficeMax was the online checkout page. The $179.99 advertised price, when clicking to buy, turned into $199.99. As I was scratching my head about how bogus this was, up popped the site's chatbot. Either a robot or a human robot gave me their name and typed, ""It will be my pleasure to assist you today.""

The chatbot replied that OfficeMax would honor the $179.99 price. All I had to do was purchase the product online, supply the chatbot with the order number, and the $179.99 price would be honored. I was skeptical but clicked purchase anyway because I was excited about getting a new router—and I could immediately go pick it up at the retail store about a mile from my house.

The $20 difference never showed on my invoice, even after I picked up my new router. So before I unboxed the product, I called the ""customer service"" phone line. I manipulated through the company's automated answering service that I suspect OfficeMax executives have never experienced or are too embarrassed to admit to having ever used. I finally got a human on the line and loudly explained my situation repeatedly.

""I do apologize"" was the agent's response.

The company honored the $20 discount. I said a few more things I should not have said.

""I do apologize,"" was the agent's reaction.

This was only the beginning of my OfficeMax nightmare.

Take me to your leader

I began to set up my router, and I downloaded the Linksys iPhone app from the Apple App store. I finally got it up and running after several attempts using the app. Despite this setup failure, the app was pretty beast. It gave me all sorts of options, including one to cut Internet to any connected device I wanted. I had great fun secretly cutting off the Xbox connection while my two sons were playing—multiple times. ""DAD!""

But such shenanigans weren't worth the $179 price. This router was working no better, and, in fact, was functioning worse than my Apple router. And every time I unplugged it to test it against the Apple router, I had to go through the same initial setup process after powering it back on.

So knowing that OfficeMax had a 14-day return policy, two days later, I packed up the product and drove it back to the OfficeMax where I purchased it.

I waited in line, gave the cashier my receipt, and set the Velop on the counter. After a few minutes of trying to give me a refund, the cashier called over a manager. Because I bought the router online, they said, I couldn't return the product to the store where I picked it up. The manager told me I needed to call their ""customer service"" number to arrange a courier to come pick it up from my residence.

I haggled for a few minutes, to no avail. I left with everybody in the store's cavernous warehouse hearing about how dumb I thought they were.

I drove the mile's distance home and made the call. After ping-ponging my way through the automated corporate telephone lines again, ""I do apologize"" was the response I got from the customer service agent after I explained my displeasure with the return policy.

That was on Friday, October 20. The representative said a courier would be over sometime between 8am and 5pm on Monday. After I said I wasn't going to wait at home all day, she said the courier would call to give a closer time window.

""I do apologize.""

Monday came and went with neither a pickup nor a call from OfficeMax. So the next morning, I suffered through the corporation's automated phone line again and told my story—again.

""I do apologize.""

A courier, I was told, would pick it up between 2pm and 4pm today (Tuesday). My response was unfit to print.

""I do apologize.""

Nobody showed.

After suffering through the corporate automated phone line another time, I explained my story—yet again. Somebody, they said, would come Wednesday between 8am and 5pm to pick up the router.

""I do apologize.""

I said I might not be there. I was told that I should just brown-box it up and take the product to a UPS store. I responded that I already took it to the OfficeMax store where I bought it and was rejected. So I said I wasn't going to drive it to a UPS store. Come get it was the G-rated explanation of what I said.

""I do apologize.""

Later that day, Wednesday, I received a call from OfficeMax saying the package would be picked up not today but sometime between 8am and 5pm Thursday. The G-rated version of my response was the same. They said they'd call before coming to make sure I would be at home.

""I do apologize.""

Thursday morning, a courier knocked on the door and picked up the router. I signed for it. I asked for a receipt, but the technology apparently didn't exist to give me one.

About an hour later, I got a call from OfficeMax informing me that a courier would be coming later that afternoon between 2pm and 4pm to pick up the router.

Click.

I’m a dumb Luddite

As it turns out, this entire ordeal could have been avoided in the first place. I was so excited to jump into the mesh-networking game that I committed a grave IT error. What I didn't do was run a speed test directly connected to my Internet provider's modem. Had I done so, I would have realized immediately that it wasn't my Apple router malfunctioning. Instead, it was either Wave Broadband's supplied modem or something else.

As I was waiting for OfficeMax to pick up their router, I called Wave Broadband. The cable guy came out and supplied me with a new modem. My speeds returned to fantastic, and everything was good. But like before, all of a sudden my network returned to a snail's pace. Clearly, there was a larger issue.

A different cable guy returned a couple of days later, ran all kinds of tests, and concluded there needed to be some work done on the telephone pole outside my residence. The next day, the service was performed.

My Apple router is now humming again at monster, Star Trek-like speeds.

All of that said, my business dealings with OfficeMax continued for another week after the courier picked up my return router. That's how long it took for my refund to show up on my PayPal account.

I'm never shopping again at OfficeMax, even if everything is free."
Dan Goodin,TorMoil threatens Mac and Linux versions of Tor browser; Windows and Tails not affected.,2017-11-03T22:30:10Z,ars-technica,Critical Tor flaw leaks users’ real IP address—update now,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/critical-tor-flaw-leaks-users-real-ip-address-update-now/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/tor-update-760x380.png,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Mac and Linux versions of the Tor anonymity browser just received a temporary fix for a critical vulnerability that leaks users' IP addresses when they visit certain types of addresses.

TorMoil, as the flaw has been dubbed by its discoverer, is triggered when users click on links that begin with file:// rather than the more common https:// and http:// address prefixes. When the Tor browser for macOS and Linux is in the process of opening such an address, ""the operating system may directly connect to the remote host, bypassing Tor Browser,"" according to a brief blog post published Tuesday by We Are Segment, the security firm that privately reported the bug to Tor developers.

On Friday, members of the Tor Project issued a temporary work-around that plugs that IP leak. Until the final fix is in place, updated versions of the browser may not behave properly when navigating to file:// addresses. They said both the Windows versions of Tor, Tails, and the sandboxed Tor browser that's in alpha testing aren't vulnerable.

""The fix we deployed is just a workaround stopping the leak,"" Tor officials wrote in a post announcing Friday's release. ""As a result of that navigating file:// URLs in the browser might not work as expected anymore. In particular entering file:// URLs in the URL bar and clicking on resulting links is broken. Opening those in a new tab or new window does not work either. A workaround for those issues is dragging the link into the URL bar or on a tab instead. We track this follow-up regression in bug 24136.""

Friday's post went on to say that We Are Segment CEO Filippo Cavallarin privately reported the vulnerability on October 26. Tor developers worked with Mozilla developers to create a work-around the following day, but it only partially worked. They finished work on a more complete work-around on Tuesday. The post didn't explain why the fix, delivered in Tor browser version 7.0.9 for Mac and Linux users, wasn't issued until Friday, three days later. The Tor browser is based on Mozilla's open-source Firefox browser. The IP leak stems from a Firefox bug.

Tor officials also warned that alpha versions of the Tor browser for Mac and Linux haven't yet received the fix. They said they have tentatively scheduled a patch to go live on Monday for those versions. In the meantime, the officials said, Mac and Linux alpha users should use updated versions of the stable version.

Tor's statement Friday said there's no evidence the flaw has been actively exploited on the Internet or darkweb to obtain the IP addresses or Tor users. Of course, the lack of evidence doesn't mean the flaw wasn't exploited by law enforcement officers, private investigators, or stalkers. And now that a fix is available, it will be easy for adversaries who didn't know about the vulnerability before to create working exploits. Anyone who relies on a Mac or Linux version of the Tor browser to shield their IP address should update as soon as possible and be ready for the possibility, however remote, their IP addresses have already been leaked."
Joe Mullin,"One trade secret, one expert, and Otto Trucking—all kicked out of the case.",2017-11-03T20:57:58Z,ars-technica,"In new Waymo v. Uber order, judge pounds on Waymo",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/in-new-waymo-v-uber-order-judge-pounds-on-waymo/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/waymo.ceo_.car_.detroit-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"The final details are falling into place as Waymo v. Uber approaches trial later this month. While Uber has been on the receiving end of plenty of harsh words from US District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the litigation, this week it became Waymo's turn to feel the heat—and face new limits on its case.

In an order (PDF) published yesterday, Alsup dismissed Otto Trucking, a holding company created by Anthony Levandowski, from the case. The judge stated on the record his suspicions that Waymo intended to improperly use the company as a stand-in for Levandowski, who is not a defendant in the case. The order also throws out one of Waymo's nine alleged trade secrets. Separately, Alsup will unveil an order tomorrow that apparently will kick out Waymo's damages expert.

Further Reading Waymo has a big lead in driverless cars—but here’s how it could lose it The Waymo v. Uber litigation began in February, when Waymo accused Levandowski, the chief of Uber's self-driving car project, of stealing more than 14,000 files shortly before he resigned from Google. He founded a startup called Otto, which was sold to Uber within months for $680 million in stock and cash. Levandowski—who is, again, not a defendant in the case—has pleaded the Fifth Amendment and avoided answering questions about the accusations. Uber denies that any secrets ended up on the company's servers and says its lidar technology was built independently.

Otto Trucking occupies an odd place in the litigation. Uber acquired Otto's self-driving technology, but the trucking division was left as a separate entity. It ""exists simply as a holding company to own trucks equipped with Velodyne’s LiDAR system,"" according to Alsup's order, and the company has separate counsel in the lawsuit.

Smoke and mirrors

Alsup expressed frustration that Waymo keeps ""lumping [Otto Trucking] together with Uber and Levandowski under various unpersuasive theories."" The judge finds it a ""recurring problem"" in the lawsuit that ""Waymo repeatedly suggests that Otto Trucking should be deemed automatically liable for trade secret misappropriation by Levandowski"" (emphasis in original).

He goes on to suggest that Waymo could improperly use Otto Trucking as a kind of ""stand-in"" for the acts of Levandowski, a person whom Waymo deliberately chose not to sue, for strategic reasons. Alsup writes:

Having made and benefitted from its strategic choice to not name Levandowski as a defendant, Waymo may not renege and suggest that Otto Trucking—or any other defendant—is somehow a stand-in for Levandowski, or that misappropriation by Levandowski is somehow automatically transmogrified into misrepresentation by Otto Trucking—or any other defendant—such that Waymo need not separately prove the latter. Waymo’s strongest evidence on misappropriation is about Levandowski, not about Otto Trucking, and as a result of its own litigation strategy, Waymo cannot treat the two as fungible targets.

The order goes on to remove one of Waymo's nine asserted trade secrets from the trial. In a partly redacted section, Alsup states that the secret, dubbed Trade Secret 96, isn't really a trade secret at all.

Further Reading Waymo’s staggering settlement demand for Uber: $1 billion Waymo's evidence regarding number 96 is ""merely a more detailed rendition of the evidence it had offered with respect to asserted trade secret number one—which claimed the concept of [REDACTED] on a printed circuit board in a LiDAR system,"" writes Alsup. An earlier order held that ""Waymo’s asserted trade secret number one was 'nothing more than Optics 101,' deleting that supposed 'trade secret' from the case long before the parties began to argue over asserted trade secret number 96.""

The trade secret has something to do with the Petzval surfaces for Waymo's transmit lenses. Waymo's expert, Dr. Lambertus Hesselink, compared Uber and Waymo transmit lenses with a series of parabolic graphs.

""Two identical lenses will always have identical Petzval surfaces—always,"" writes Alsup. ""That proves nothing for Waymo... Dr. Hesselink’s emphasis on the similarity of the Petzval surfaces is a trick—smoke and mirrors.""

Uber celebrated the recent ruling, with a company spokesperson writing via e-mail:

Waymo's case continues to shrink. After dropping their patent claims, this week Waymo lost one of the trade secrets they claimed was most important, had their damages expert excluded, and saw an entire defendant removed from the case—and all this before the trial has even started.

Waymo's take on the recent orders was also sent by a spokesperson via e-mail:

Physical inspections of Uber’s devices, as well as photos and CAD drawings received during discovery, show Uber is using Waymo’s trade secrets, including copying aspects of Waymo’s LiDAR designs down to the micron. Our case has always been principally against Uber and Ottomotto, and we look forward to presenting our evidence on multiple trade secrets at trial. We are also pleased that the Court expressly recognized the possibility of including Otto Trucking in any future injunction and/or potential subsequent trial.

Other Uber tactics to limit the trial didn't succeed. For instance, the ride-sharing company tried to get Waymo's trade secret number nine kicked out of the case, but that effort failed.

The Wagner order is set to be unveiled tomorrow. But the order about the unsealing has been published (PDF), and it's titled ""Order excluding Michael Wagner, restricting use of financial evidence at trial, and denying other relief."""
Scott K. Johnson,Report appears to have cleared federal review despite censorship fears.,2017-11-03T20:24:45Z,ars-technica,US government climate report: Climate change is real and our fault,https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/us-government-climate-report-climate-change-is-real-and-our-fault/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/nca_fig-760x350.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Information about the science and consequences of climate change has been removed from a number of federal agency websites since the Trump administration took over. But some agencies like NASA seem to have continued their work unhindered. And today saw the release of the fourth National Climate Assessment—an official summary of the current state of knowledge about climate change.

The heavily peer-reviewed report, following the last edition in 2014, is coordinated by NOAA, NASA, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the US Global Change Research Program. A group of US climate scientists volunteered to write the report, which gathers together the most recent peer-reviewed research into digestible conclusions about the causes and impacts of climate change.

No interference

A June 2017 draft was shared with The New York Times by someone who feared it might be censored by federal agencies during the final approval process. But in a call with media, NOAA’s David Fahey (one of three coordinating lead authors of the report) responded to questions about censorship by saying he was “quite confident” that there had been no political interference with the contents of the report. An initial review of the highlighted main points of the report’s “executive summary” shows only a few insignificant wording changes from the June 2017 draft.

Carl Mears, who helps run Remote Sensing System's satellite temperature dataset and was a lead author on the report, told Ars, ""I didn't see any signs of political interference for the chapters I was involved in. The comments from the agencies appeared to be from scientists, and most if not all were directed toward making the report clearer and easier to understand.""

Similar to the structure of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment reports, this first section of the Climate Assessment focuses on the physical science of climate change. The second half—which has not yet been finalized—will cover the impacts of climate change on the United States.

The conclusions are also largely similar to those of the last IPCC report, but some are stated a little more clearly—perhaps in response to the deliberate misrepresentation of some of those conclusions by politicians and “skeptics.”

It's us, and it's everywhere

The topline conclusion is obviously the degree to which observed global warming is human-caused, and the report pulls no punches: “Many lines of evidence demonstrate that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Over the last century, there are no convincing alternative explanations supported by the extent of the observational evidence.”

Specifically, the report quantifies the amount of human-caused warming in the period from 1951 to 2010: between 0.6-0.8 degrees Celsius (1.1-1.4 degrees Fahrenheit). Its best estimate of the total temperature change for that same time period is right within that range, at 0.65 degrees Celsius (1.2 degrees Fahrenheit). (Note that the warming influence of human activities can be larger than the actual change if natural factors would have caused cooling.)

The report also summarizes the evidence for changes in extreme weather of various types. Heat waves and intense rainfall events are up in most places, for example, while trends in tornadoes are unclear. Looking forward, it notes that the frequency and severity of “atmospheric river” weather patterns hitting the West Coast are expected to increase. Snowpack in the West (key to water supplies) is expected to shrink.

On the topic of wildfires and their relationship to weather patterns, the report finds that the “incidence of large forest fires in the western United States and Alaska has increased since the early 1980s (high confidence) and is projected to further increase in those regions as the climate warms.”

The report’s sea level rise projections are notably frank about the uncertainty surrounding the worst-case scenario. While it projects 0.3 to 1.3 meters (1 to 4.3 feet) of sea level rise over the 21st century, it notes that “eight feet by 2100 is physically possible, although the probability of such an extreme outcome cannot currently be assessed.”

Improved science, decaying acceptance

If you’re wondering what could have changed since the last report in 2014, the new Assessment highlights a list of areas in which our understanding has improved. That includes the evaluation of the human contribution to individual extreme weather events, higher-resolution climate models producing better simulations of things like hurricanes, and studies of ice loss in Greenland and Antarctica that have bumped the worst-case sea level rise estimates upward.

While the report doesn’t speak to potential climate policies, it does explain that existing emissions pledges are not sufficient to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit)—long an international goal. And it provides this sobering reminder: “The present-day emissions rate of nearly 10 [billion tons of carbon] per year suggests that there is no climate analog for this century any time in at least the last 50 million years.” In other words, if the planet has ever seen anything like this, it probably predates the end of the dinosaurs.

In a statement, the White House said, ""The climate has changed and is always changing. As the Climate Science Special Report states, the magnitude of future climate change depends significantly on 'remaining uncertainty in the sensitivity of Earth's climate to [greenhouse gas] emissions.'""

This is true, but only to the extent that the projected warming between about 2000 and 2100 in the highest emissions scenario (for example) is 2.6 to 4.8 degrees Celsius, which includes that uncertainty. But that means we can be pretty certain it's going to get a lot warmer. As the report actually says, the majority of the uncertainty is in the future trajectory of our emissions: ""Global climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond. The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases emitted globally and on the remaining uncertainty in the sensitivity of Earth’s climate to those emissions.""

As the report makes clear, there is no reasonable doubt remaining that climate change is a story about human actions—not natural cycles."
Sam Machkovech,Shock announcement comes at outset of annual Blizzcon event.,2017-11-03T20:01:35Z,ars-technica,Blizzard finally relents to years of fan pressure with World of Warcraft Classic,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/world-of-warcraft-classic-is-official-will-bring-vanilla-wow-back/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-03-at-12.30.23-PM-760x380.png,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Blizzard's annual Blizzcon event in Anaheim, California, kicked off on Friday with various game-related announcements, but the most surprising one dug back into the company's history. Finally, fans' requests for a major turn back of the World of Warcraft clock are coming to life in the form of World of Warcraft Classic.

""Before I get to the big news today, I want to talk about ice cream,"" WoW Executive Producer J. Allen Brack told the Blizzcon crowd. ""I understand that for some of you, your favorite flavor is vanilla.""

This was a reference to ""vanilla"" WoW servers, which players have logged in to behind Blizzard's official back to play earlier, pre-expansion versions of WoW. After countless shutdowns, arguments, and meetings over the past few years, along with petitions begging the company to make a paid version of what they wanted, Blizzard is finally relenting with its own official take on the concept.

Further Reading World of Warcraft: Legion review—You’re in charge now No release date, footage, or other gameplay details have yet been revealed, though Blizzard may disclose more about the project during various Blizzcon panels this weekend. Instead, Blizzard showed fans a trailer that rewound various cinematic clips from the game's expansions before showing a familiar-looking bearded dwarf walking in the snow from the game's very first edition.

""Fans of World of Warcraft around the world, we hear you,"" Brack told the crowd. ""I am pleased and also a little bit nervous to announce the development of a classic server option for World of Warcraft. This is a larger endeavor than you might imagine, but we are committed to making an authentic, Blizzard-quality classic experience.""

He followed with a cheeky promise to ""reproduce the classic gaming experience, but not the actual launch experience."" Brack mentioned that Blizzard had auctioned away the game's original server blades in a charity auction years ago, then he said with a laugh, ""we're probably going to need those back."" Based on what we know about Blizzard losing original game assets in the past, we aren't sure if he's joking.

For those less keen to revisit the game's vanilla version, Blizzard also took the opportunity to reveal Battle For Azeroth, the game's seventh expansion pack. That packs in two new continents, a new level cap, and other features. Sadly, the Blizzard Classic team didn't have announcements of any other projects in the works at Blizzcon this year.

Jon Brodkin,Pressure builds on FCC Chair Ajit Pai to preempt state net neutrality laws.,2017-11-03T18:13:56Z,ars-technica,Comcast asks the FCC to prohibit states from enforcing net neutrality,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/comcast-asks-the-fcc-to-prohibit-states-from-enforcing-net-neutrality/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/comcast-logo-thumbnail-640x215.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Comcast met with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai's staff this week in an attempt to prevent states from issuing net neutrality rules.

As the FCC prepares to gut its net neutrality rules, broadband providers are worried that states might enact their own laws to prevent ISPs from blocking, throttling, or discriminating against online content. Further Reading Ajit Pai announces plan to eliminate Title II net neutrality rules

Comcast Senior VP Frank Buono and a Comcast attorney met with Pai Chief of Staff Matthew Berry and Senior Counsel Nicholas Degani on Monday, the company said in an ex parte filing that describes the meeting.

Comcast urged Pai's staff to reverse the FCC's classification of broadband as a Title II common carrier service, a move that would eliminate the legal authority the FCC uses to enforce net neutrality rules. Pai has said he intends to do just that, so Comcast will likely get its wish on that point.

But Comcast also wants the FCC to go further by making a declaration that states cannot impose their own regulations on broadband. The filing said:

We also emphasized that the Commission's order in this proceeding should include a clear, affirmative ruling that expressly confirms the primacy of federal law with respect to BIAS [Broadband Internet Access Service] as an interstate information service, and that preempts state and local efforts to regulate BIAS either directly or indirectly.

Despite calling for the FCC to abandon the legal authority it uses to enforce net neutrality rules, Comcast said it supports ""a free and open Internet"" and ""legally enforceable net neutrality protections."" Comcast told Pai's staff that the FCC could adopt net neutrality rules using its other authority—but the FCC tried that in 2010, and this previous attempt at enforcing net neutrality rules was struck down in court.

Alternatively, Comcast said the FCC could decide not to impose its own rules and simply rely on the Federal Trade Commission ""to ensure that ISPs' public commitments to core open Internet protections are honored."" Such a move would essentially set up a ""voluntary"" net neutrality system in which ISPs would face no rules and would choose whether to make net neutrality commitments.

Verizon, Republicans also call for preemption

Comcast isn't the first to make a preemption argument in the net neutrality proceeding. Verizon asked the Federal Communications Commission to preempt any state laws that regulate network neutrality and broadband privacy, as we wrote earlier this week.

Current and former Republican FCC commissioners are also urging Pai to preempt states. Current FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly recently said he's open to using the FCC's preemption authority and that he wants states to be ""barred from enacting their own privacy burdens on what is by all means an interstate information service,"" i.e. broadband access. Further Reading Verizon has a new strategy to undermine online privacy and net neutrality

Former Republican FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell made a similar call when he appeared in front of a Congressional committee this week.

""The FCC should use its ample statutory authority to preempt states and localities to promote flexible and clear national rules that protect consumers and markets alike,"" he argued.

McDowell said there is a ""disturbing trend"" in which ""states and localities have tried to regulate many aspects of the broadband market, potentially creating a confusing and innovation-killing patchwork of local laws governing both the economics of the Internet and consumer privacy.""

Whether the FCC can actually preempt state-level net neutrality laws is in dispute. The FCC voted in 2015 to preempt state laws that restrict the expansion of municipal broadband, but the state laws were re-instated after a federal appeals court ruled that the FCC overstepped its legal authority.

While the FCC has some preemption powers, ""that does not mean that the FCC has the authority to preempt everything relating to broadband at all,"" Senior Counsel John Bergmayer of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge told Ars today. ""It is fairly clear, for instance, that the FCC cannot preempt state efforts around consumer protection, even when the product in question is broadband.""

Another complication is that Pai is proposing to strip away the FCC's regulatory authority over broadband providers by removing the Title II classification.

""If the FCC has no power to regulate, it has no power to preempt,"" Bergmayer said. ""Title II is all about legal authority. Trying to disclaim authority to regulate while simultaneously preempting seems somewhat paradoxical.""

Even if Pai wants to preempt states, he might have to open a new proceeding in order to do so, which would delay any such move by at least several months. The FCC has to ask the public for comment on proposed changes, but Pai's net neutrality proposal did not ask for input on preempting state net neutrality laws.

We contacted Pai's office and will update this story if we get a response. Pai's final proposal for rolling back net neutrality rules could be announced later this month and voted on at the FCC's December 14 meeting."

Over days of head-snapping developments, the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election produced indictments and a guilty plea reaching into Trump's campaign team, then eight people died in New York City in what authorities called a terrorist attack by a man acting in the name of the Islamic State group.

Trump opened an Asia trip after House Republicans came out with a tax overhaul that, if successful, could mark Trump's first major legislative achievement after a series of health care flops.

A look back at the rhetoric:

TRUMP: ""It's a tax bill for middle class; it's a tax bill for jobs, it's going to bring a lot of companies in; and it's a tax bill for business, which is going to create the jobs."" — meeting with business leaders Tuesday.

HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN: ""The focus is on middle-class tax relief. The focus is on directing that tax relief to the people in the middle and the people who are trying to get there. And that is why we put our emphasis on that tax relief for those people who are in the middle."" — news conference by House Republicans on Thursday.

THE FACTS: Let there be no doubt the middle class is a politically glorified group. Ryan can't talk about the ""middle"" enough; GOP leaders mentioned middle-income earners 14 times at the news conference. But the tax plan is tilted to companies and the wealthy. Some in the middle class are bound to pay higher taxes, some lower.

How that crapshoot plays out depends on more than income.

The plan promises tax savings next year of $1,182 for a typical household of four with a gross income of $59,000, leaving the family's tax bill at $400.

But the proposal's conflicting provisions and phase-outs of certain benefits suggest that taxes could rise for some middle-class earners over time. Middle-income people in states with high state income taxes or who have many children, high medical bills or heavy student debt are particularly at risk of a bigger tax hit. Others may benefit modestly from the lower tax rates and revamped credits and deductions.

The big numbers tell part of the tale. Of the $1.5 trillion the plan is designed to cost over 10 years, $850 billion goes to companies, according to the government's Joint Committee on Taxation. Almost all of the savings for families and individuals come from the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax and the Estate Tax — changes that benefit the wealthy.

TRUMP tweets Wednesday: ""The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based."" ""'Senator Chuck Schumer helping to import Europes problems' said Col. Tony Shaffer. We will stop this craziness! @foxandfriends""

THE FACTS: The lottery program is no more the creation (""beauty"") of the New York Democrat than it is of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch and many other Republicans who helped bring it into law in 1990. It had bipartisan support, breezed through the Senate on an 89-8 vote and was signed by GOP President George H.W. Bush.

The suspect from Uzbekistan who is accused of the deadly New York attack entered the U.S. legally in 2010 under the lottery and Trump wants to eliminate it. Schumer supported getting rid of it three years ago as part of an immigration overhaul that failed in Congress.

Trump also misplaced Uzbekistan in Europe when he referred to importing Europe's problems. It's in Asia. The State Department, though, lists Uzbekistan and other former Soviet republics under Europe in its lottery. The program lets 50,000 people in a year from countries with low emigration rates to the U.S.

Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders later said Trump was not really holding Schumer culpable in the attack.

TRUMP RE-ELECTION AD: Says health insurance premiums are skyrocketing ""while Democrats in Washington, D.C., block a better plan to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all — obstructing our president just to score political points with the radical left.""

THE FACTS: It's a diversion to describe Democrats as being responsible for the GOP's failure to repeal and replace Barack Obama's health care law. Trump's party, which controls the House and the Senate, had a chance to pass a new health law without a single Democratic vote in the summer.

Recent health care plans backed by the White House stalled chiefly because Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine and John McCain of Arizona opposed specific fixes.

It's true premiums are rising, but that's not entirely due to the health law. The consulting firm Avalere Health says premiums for the most popular Affordable Care Act plans are going up an average of 34 percent and the Trump administration's actions are contributing to the price increases by adding instability to underlying problems of the health law's marketplaces.

TRUMP tweet Tuesday: ""Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.""

THE FACTS: George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying about his Russian interactions, was not as obscure as Trump makes him out to be. Trump named Papadopoulos to his foreign policy advisory council in March 2016, where he joined a short list of experts helping the candidate with international affairs.

""Excellent guy,"" Trump told The Washington Post at the time. Trump also tweeted a photo of his March 31 advisory council meeting, with Papadopoulos among several advisers at the president's table. Jeff Sessions, then a senator and now attorney general, was helping Trump's campaign and attended at least two meetings of the advisory council with Papadopoulos also there.

In April 2016, Papadopoulos met a professor with connections to the Russian government for breakfast in London and was told Moscow had ""dirt"" helpful to Trump, namely Hillary Clinton emails. Investigators said Papadopoulos emailed a Trump campaign policy adviser the next day, saying, ""Have some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.""

Investigators said his position with the campaign, though not senior, was significant to those who wanted to pass on helpful information. The allegations unsealed Monday state that ""the professor only took interest in defendant PAPADOPOULOS because of his status with the Campaign.""

The adviser met later with more apparent Russian intermediaries.

Altogether, this episode provided evidence in the first criminal case connecting Trump's team to Russian interests.

___

TRUMP tweet Monday: ""Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.""

THE FACTS: Not true, according to the indictment against Manafort, who was Trump's campaign chairman for months last year, and against Manafort associate Rick Gates.

They are charged with criminal activities that go back to 2006 but extend to February of this year. The charges do not refer to Manafort's activities with the campaign but rather accuse him of laundering money and conspiratorial acts before, during and after he was campaign chairman.

Manafort and Gates face 12 counts, which do deal largely with activities from 2006 to 2015, before Manafort joined the campaign in March 2016.

But both are charged with conspiring together and with others to knowingly and intentionally defraud and commit crimes against the U.S. from 2006 to this year.

And both are charged with conspiring together to make false statements and conceal crimes against the U.S., and to causing others to do so, from November 2016 to February 2017.

The indictment emerged from the broad investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. It does not go to the heart of that matter.

Trump landed at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo and was greeted by cheering service members. Trump then donned a bomber jacket for a speech in which he touted American firepower and the U.S. alliance with Japan.

""Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations,"" he said, speaking in front of an American flag inside an airplane hangar.

Trump was expected to spend much of his 12-day, five-country Asian tour exhorting allies and rivals to step up efforts to counter the dangers posed by North Korea, which continues to move forward with its nuclear weapons program. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have been engaged in an escalating war of words, with Trump repeatedly referring to Un as ""Little Rocket Man"" and threatening in a recent speech to ""totally destroy"" the nation, if necessary.

Even before he landed, Trump used the first moments of the trip to denounce the North as ""a big problem"" that must ""be solved.""

""There's been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach"" toward the North, he told reporters traveling with him.

During the speech, Trump did not mention North Korea by name, but warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the ""most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.""

""Together with our allies, America's warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one — no dictator, no regime and no nation — should underestimate, ever, American resolve,"" Trump told the troops.

Some regional analysts have speculated that Trump's presence in Asia may prompt North Korea to take provocative action, like another missile test. Trump, when asked about that possibility aboard Air Force One, said ""we'll soon find out.""

After the speech, Trump flew by helicopter to the Kasumigaseki Country Club about 20 miles outside of Tokyo for lunch and a round of golf with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Japanese golfer Hideki Matsuyama. An avid golfer, Trump said Matsuyama is ""probably the greatest player in the history of Japan.""

Trump and Abe have struck up a personal friendship, forged through multiple meetings and telephone conversations, as well as on the greens of one of Trump's Florida golf clubs and over intimate dinners at Trump's Florida estate.

At the club, the leaders signed white caps inscribed with the phrase, ""Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater,"" a tribute to the U.S.-Japan friendship and a play on Trump's campaign slogan. On the menu: a hamburger made from U.S. beef.

The trip, which marks the longest Far East itinerary for a president in a generation, comes at a precarious moment for Trump. Days ago, his former campaign chairman was indicted and another adviser pleaded guilty as part of an investigation into possible collusion between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russian officials.

The journey will also test Trump's stamina. But the 71-year-old president assured reporters that he was up for the task. ""It's grueling, they tell me, but fortunately that's historically not been a problem for me. One thing you people will say, that's not been a problem,"" he said.

The visit will be closely watched by Asian allies worried that Trump's inward-looking ""America First"" agenda could cede power in the region to China. They also are rattled by his bellicose rhetoric toward North Korea. The North's growing missile arsenal threatens several of the capitals Trump will visit.

The trip will also put Trump in face-to-face meetings with authoritarian leaders for whom he has expressed admiration. They include China's Xi Jinping, whom Trump has likened to ""a king,"" and the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte, who has sanctioned the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers.

Trump is also expected to have a second private audience with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a summit in Vietnam. Trump told reporters he ""will want Putin's help"" in dealing with North Korea. They previously met during a summit in Europe this summer.

The White House has signaled that Trump will push American economic interests in the region, but the North Korea issue is expected to dominate the trip. One of Trump's two major speeches will come before the National Assembly in Seoul. But fiery threats against the North could resonate differently than they do from the distance of Washington.

Trump will forgo a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, the stark border between North and South Korea. All U.S. presidents except one since Ronald Reagan have visited the DMZ in a sign of solidarity with Seoul. The White House contends that Trump's commitment to South Korea is already crystal clear, as evidenced by his war of words with Kim and his threats to deliver ""fire and fury"" to North Korea if it does not stop threatening American allies.

The escalation of rhetoric, a departure from the conduct of past presidents, has undermined confidence in the U.S. as a stabilizing presence in Asia.

""There's a danger if there is a lot of muscle flexing,"" said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California. ""Trump has been going right up to the edge and I wouldn't rule out some sort of forceful North Korean reaction to Trump's presence in the region,"" he said.

The White House said Trump would be undeterred.

""The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously,"" White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters before Trump departed Washington. ""I don't think the president really modulates his language, have you noticed?""

A high-level employee at Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holding Company told The Associated Press that the royal was among those detained overnight Saturday. The employee said he received calls from several security bodies notifying him of the arrest. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of repercussions.

The Associated Press reached out overnight to Kingdom Holding for comment. There was no response as of Sunday morning.

Prince Alwaleed is one of the Middle East's richest people, with investments in Twitter, Apple, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Citigroup, and the Four Seasons, Fairmont and Movenpick hotel chains. He is also an investor in ride-sharing services Lyft and Careem, both competitors to Uber in the U.S. and the Middle East, respectively.

The prince, often pictured on his multimillion dollar 85.65-metre (281 foot) superyacht in the Mediterranean, is also known for being among the most outspoken Saudi royals, long advocating for women's rights. He is also majority owner of the popular Rotana Group of Arabic channels.

Official state media have not reported on the arrests, but the kingdom's top council of clerics issued a statement saying it is an Islamic duty to fight corruption— essentially giving religious backing to the high-level arrests being reported.

The Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya satellite news channel reported that at least 11 princes and dozens of former ministers had been detained in the probe launched by a new anti-corruption committee. The committee is led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Saudi Twitter accounts released names of several high-ranking princes, including a prominent and powerful son of the late King Abdullah, Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was removed from his post as head of the National Guard overnight.

The arrests came as Lebanon's prime minister, a close Saudi ally, announced his own resignation from the Saudi capital. Yemeni rebels, the target of a 2 ½ year Saudi-led military campaign, meanwhile fired a ballistic missile toward Riyadh's international airport on Saturday night that was intercepted by Saudi air defense before it could cause any damage.

Al-Arabiya reported that the anti-graft committee is looking into deadly floods that overwhelmed parts of the city of Jiddah in 2009 and the government's response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus that has killed several hundred people in the past few years.

Reports also suggested those detained were being held in the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, which only days earlier hosted a major investment conference. The phone number for the hotel had been disconnected by Sunday morning and a Dubai-based spokeswoman for the hotel chain did not respond to a request for comment.

The government said the anti-corruption committee has the right to issue arrest warrants, impose travel restrictions and freeze bank accounts. It can also trace funds, prevent the transfer of funds or the liquidation of assets, and take other precautionary measures until cases are referred to the judiciary.

The royal order said the committee was established ""due to the propensity of some people for abuse, putting their personal interest above public interest, and stealing public funds.""

Saudi nationals have long complained of rampant corruption in government and of public funds being squandered or misused by people in power.

Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, said the scale of the arrests are designed to further smooth the young crown prince's eventual succession to the throne.

""As a leader who is set to remain in power for decades, Mohammed bin Salman is remaking the kingdom in his own image and signaling a potentially significant move away from the consensual balancing of competing interests that characterized Saudi rule in the past,"" Ulrichsen said.

Prince Miteb was replaced by a lesser known royal, Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin, who had held a senior post with the National Guard.

Prince Miteb's father— the late King Abdullah— also had led the National Guard and had transformed it into a powerful and prestigious force tasked with protecting the ruling Al Saud family, as well as important holy sites in Mecca and Medina, and oil and gas sites.

Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne. His ouster essentially sidelines one of the most formidable rivals to the current crown prince, who is also defense minister. Just three months ago, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was ousted from the line of succession and from his post as interior minister, overseeing internal security.

Only hours earlier, Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri resigned from his post in a televised address from Riyadh, offering a vicious tirade against Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah group for what he said was their meddling in Arab affairs.

""Iran's arms in the region will be cut off,"" Hariri said.

Saudi Arabia then said its forces intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Iran-backed rebels in Yemen toward one of the kingdom's major international airports on the outskirts of Riyadh. A Saudi-led coalition launched a war against the Houthi rebels and their allies in March 2015 that grinds on today, a campaign overseeing by Crown Prince Mohammed.

The missile fire drew an immediate rebuke from President Donald Trump, who blamed Iran in part for the attack.

""A shot was just taken by Iran, in my opinion, at Saudi Arabia. And our system knocked it down,"" Trump said, referring to the Patriot missile batteries Saudi Arabia has purchased from the U.S. ""That's how good we are. Nobody makes what we make and now we're selling it all over the world.""

It's unclear if the U.S. had any advance word of the coming arrests. Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner and others made an unannounced trip recently to Riyadh. Trump earlier Saturday said he spoke to King Salman about listing the kingdom's massive state-run oil company, Saudi Aramco, in the United States.

This is the first time that a Houthi missile has come so close to a heavily populated area, and it appears to be the farthest that such a missile has reached inside Saudi Arabia. Riyadh is around 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) north of the border with Yemen.

A Saudi military spokesman condemned the attack in a statement, saying the missile was fired ""indiscriminately"" toward a populated civilian area.

Saudi military forces have intercepted missiles fired by Houthis several times since March 2015, when a Saudi-led coalition launched a war against the rebels and their allies after they captured northern Yemen and ousted the Saudi-backed president from power. The kingdom has also imposed an air and sea blockade on Yemen.

The stalemated war has killed more than 10,000 civilians and displaced 3 million others, pushing the Arab world's poorest country to the brink of famine.

Saudi Arabia accuses its rival, Shiite power Iran, of training and helping arm the rebels. Iran denies that it has provided material support, though it acknowledges its political support of the Houthis.

The U.S., which is one of the kingdom's most important military suppliers, has backed the Saudi-led coalition with logistical support. Responding to the attack, Trump immediately put some of the blame on Iran.

""A shot was just taken by Iran, in my opinion, at Saudi Arabia. And our system knocked it down,"" Trump said, referring to the Patriot missile batteries Saudi Arabia has purchased from the U.S. ""That's how good we are. Nobody makes what we make and now we're selling it all over the world.""

Iranian state media and officials did not immediately comment early Sunday on Trump's remarks.

News outlet Al-Masirah said the missile launched Saturday evening was made in Yemen and was the third to be fired toward Riyadh this year. It reported the rebels saying the missile was fired in response to ""Saudi-American aggression and crimes against the people of Yemen.""

Earlier this week, a suspected airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 29 people, including children, in northern Yemen.

Donna Brazile makes the revelation in a memoir being released Tuesday that has renewed deep divisions within the Democratic Party.

The Washington Post obtained an advance copy of ""Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House.""

Brazile writes that she considered initiating Clinton's removal after she collapsed while leaving a 9/11 memorial service in New York City. Clinton later acknowledged she was suffering from pneumonia.

But Brazile says the larger issue was that her campaign was ""anemic"" and had taken on ""the odor of failure.""

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez tried to calm the rival factions Saturday with a statement on new procedures intended to make the next primary more fair.

Brazile writes that after considering a dozen combinations to replace Clinton and her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine from Virginia, she settled on Biden and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as those with the best chance of defeating Trump.

Ultimately, the former DNC head says: ""I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them.""

It was unclear whether Biden was willing to step into the race or even whether he discussed the idea with Brazile. A spokesman for the former vice president didn't respond to a request for comment Saturday.

Brazile writes that on Sept. 12, 2016, the day after Clinton collapsed, Biden's chief of staff called saying the vice president wanted to speak with her and that her thought at the time was ""Gee, I wonder what he wanted to talk to me about?"" The Post report gave no further details and it was unclear whether the book elaborates on this.

As for Brazile's powers to determine the party's candidate, she writes that as party chair she would oversee the process of replacing a nominee who became disabled.

In an excerpt published earlier by Politico, Brazile says she believed a joint fundraising agreement signed between Clinton and the DNC ""looked unethical"" and that she felt Clinton had too much influence on the party during a competitive Democratic primary with rival Bernie Sanders.

During the nomination process for the 2016 election Democrats argued among themselves over whether Clinton was being given an unfair advantage over Sanders, a Vermont independent who sought the party's nomination with the backing of its more liberal members.

On Saturday, Perez issued a statement saying he and the DNC leadership were committed to ensuring that the nomination process in 2020 will be ""unquestionably fair and transparent.""

Among the reforms he said he developed after listening to Democrats across the party spectrum was ensuring that ""no candidate participating in our presidential nominating process gains any unfair advantage — real or perceived — during our primary season."" He also said the debate schedule would be decided in advance rather than negotiated after all candidates had entered the race.

Perez also pledged to ensure that all joint fundraising agreements would be transparent, including the new Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund agreements developed with the 50 state parties."

A 16-month-old baby, he was at a childcare center in downtown Tokyo with his 3-year-old sister, waiting to be picked up by their mother. She never returned.

Yaeko Taguchi, then 22, was kidnapped by North Korea agents in June 1978, presumably on her way to the nursery from a night job she was working to raise the children as a divorced mother. The baby boy was adopted by Taguchi's brother, Shigeo Iizuka, and raised as his fourth child; his sister was adopted by an aunt.

Taguchi's whereabouts weren't known for nearly a quarter century until North Korea, after years of denials, acknowledged in 2002 abducting about a dozen Japanese citizens. Iizuka, now a 40-year-old computer programmer, wants President Donald Trump to learn about the ordeal of the relatives of those abducted when he meets some of them in Tokyo on Monday.

Japan says North Korea snatched at least 17 people in the 1970s and '80s to train its spies in Japanese culture and language so they pass as Japanese and spy on South Korea. Pyongyang has admitted abducting 13 of them, including Taguchi, and has allowed five to visit Japan — they stayed instead of returning to the North. North Korea said the other eight had died, and no other abductee has since returned.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made resolving the abduction issue a top policy goal that he pledged would not be put to rest until all victims return home. There is no sign of any progress amid new tensions created by North Korea's escalating missile and nuclear threats, making it more difficult to seek answers from Pyongyang.

Everyone is getting older, and Iizuka is frustrated. He still believes his mother, who would be 62, is alive, largely because the North hasn't provided reliable proof of her death. North Korea only told Japan that she was killed in a car accident in 1986.

Trump's engagement has breathed new hope that the fate of the abductees will be finally exposed and possibly all the remaining Japanese returned home in one group, according to Iizuka. He wants to be part of the meeting with Trump and some relatives on Monday.

""I want to tell him that our loved ones were kidnapped to North Korea and we need help. I want to ask President Trump to join our effort to rescue the victims and bring them back to Japan,"" Iizuka told The Associated Press in an interview. ""It's wrong that families cannot be together for 40 years, because we are forcibly separated by a certain country.""

Iizuka says he was too young to remember anything about his mother. ""I only know her through the pictures and the stories I heard from my dad and uncle ... But I don't know anything about her, such as her gestures, her taste, and what she liked to study at school.""

Trump is the third American president to meet abductee families, following George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The mysterious death this year of American student Otto Warmbier, who was detained in Pyongyang and returned home with brain damage only to die days later, has raised questions about the North's human rights conditions, Iizuka said.

He hopes Trump would be able to talk directly to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

""When that happens, I hope President Trump brings up the abduction issue and tells Kim Jong Un that the problem must be resolved. I think it's most important,"" Iizuka said. ""In North Korea, Kim Jong Un is the only one who makes a decision, and Mr. Trump's cooperation on the abduction issue would be a huge support.""

He hopes his father, Shigeo, gets to see his sister again in their lifetime. And Iizuka already decided what he will tell her when she returns home one day.

""I want to call her mother,"" he said. ""She hasn't heard me say that to her yet.""

That blunt assessment from the Pentagon is in response to a letter from two Democratic congressmen asking about casualty assessments in a conflict with North Korea.

Rear Adm. Michael J. Dumont of the Joint Staff offered the assessment in response to a letter from Reps. Ted Lieu of California and Ruben Gallego of Arizona.

Dumont noted that the U.S. is evaluating North Korea's ability to target heavily populated areas of South Korea with long-range artillery, rockets and ballistic missiles. He also pointed out that Seoul, the South's capital with a population of 25 million, is just 35 miles from the demilitarized zone. The amount of casualties would differ depending on the advance warning and the ability of U.S. and South Korea forces to counter these attacks, he said.

""A classified briefing would be the best place to discuss in detail the capability of the U.S. and its allies to discuss capabilities to counter North Korea's ability to respond with a nuclear weapon and eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons located in deeply buried, underground facilities,"" he said. He also mentioned the possibility that chemical and biological weapons might be used by the North in case of a conflict.

Military officials would be happy to join ""the intelligence community to address these issues in a classified briefing,"" he said.

In a joint statement issued Saturday, 15 Democratic lawmakers and one Republican— all military veterans — called the assessment that a ground invasion would be required to destroy the North's nuclear arsenal ""deeply disturbing"" and that such an action ""could result in hundreds of thousands, or even millions of deaths in just the first few days of fighting.""

""It is our intent to have a full public accounting of the potential cost of war, so the American people understand the commitment we would be making as a nation if we were to pursue military action,"" the lawmakers said.

They also said the Trump administration ""has failed to articulate any plans to prevent the military conflict from expanding beyond the Korean Peninsula and to manage what happens after the conflict is over.""

""With that in mind, the thought of sending troops into harm's way and expending resources on another potentially unwinnable war is chilling. The President needs to stop making provocative statements that hinder diplomatic options and put American troops further at risk,"" they said."

The Trump Organization denied the domain names were ever compromised. But a review of internet records by the AP and cybersecurity experts shows otherwise. And it was not until this past week, after the Trump camp was asked about it by the AP, that the last of the tampered-with addresses were repaired.

After the hack, computer users who visited the Trump-related addresses were unwittingly redirected to servers in St. Petersburg, Russia, that cybersecurity experts said contained malicious software commonly used to steal passwords or hold files for ransom. Whether anyone fell victim to such tactics is unclear.

A further mystery is who the hackers were and why they did it.

The discovery represents a new twist in the Russian hacking story, which up to now has focused mostly on what U.S. intelligence officials say was a campaign by the Kremlin to try to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton's candidacy and benefit Trump's.

It is not known whether the hackers who tampered with the Trump addresses are the same ones who stole Democratic officials' emails and embarrassed the party in the heat of the campaign last year. Nor is it clear whether the hackers were acting on behalf of the Russian government.

The affected addresses, or domain names, included donaldtrump.org, donaldtrumpexecutiveoffice.com, donaldtrumprealty.com and barrontrump.com. They were compromised in two waves of attacks in August and September 2013, according to the review of internet records.

The attacks took place as Trump was preparing to travel to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant, which was held on Nov. 9, 2013, at a property owned by a wealthy Russian real estate developer.

Many of the addresses were not being used by Trump. Businesses and public figures commonly buy addresses for possible future use or to prevent them from falling into the hands of rivals or enemies. The Trump Organization and its affiliates own at least 3,300 in all.

According to security experts, the hackers hijacked the addresses by penetrating and altering the domain registration records housed at GoDaddy.com, a seller of web addresses.

Accounts at GoDaddy, like at any site that requires a user name and password, are often subject to malicious messages known as phishing attacks, which are designed to trick people to reveal that personal information to hackers.

Computer users who entered or clicked on one of those Trump addresses probably would have had no idea they were redirected to servers in Russia.

Within days after the AP asked the Trump Organization about the tampering, the affected web addresses were all corrected.

The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

GoDaddy spokesman Nick Fuller said the company had no breaches of its system in 2013 and has measures in place to monitor for malicious activity. Fuller would not discuss any customers in particular.

Some cybersecurity experts said there is an outside chance the tampering was a probe — an attempt to test security for an eventual effort to gather information on Trump or his business dealings. But those experts were only guessing.

There was no evidence the hackers ultimately broke into server computers at the Trump Organization or other Trump interests.

""This is beyond me,"" said Paul Vixie, CEO of the San Mateo, California-based internet security company Farsight Security Inc. ""I have simply never seen a benefit accrue from an attack of this kind. I'm at loss, unless it's a demonstration of capabilities.""

Vixie said the Trump Organization's apparent failure to detect what was happening probably suggests inadequate cybersecurity at the company.

""There's no way something like this could go by in the Bloomberg empire without this being seen,"" Vixie said.

In his resignation speech, Hariri fired a vicious tirade against Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah group for what he said was their meddling in Arab affairs and said that ""Iran's arms in the region will be cut off.""

""The evil that Iran spreads in the region will backfire on it,"" Hariri said, accusing Tehran of spreading chaos, strife and destruction throughout the region.

Hariri was appointed prime minister in late 2016 and headed a 30-member coalition government that included members of the Shiite militant Hezbollah. But it's been an uneasy partnership between Hariri, who heads a Sunni-led camp loyal to Saudi Arabia, and Hezbollah, which represents a camp loyal to Shiite Iran. President Michel Aoun, who was elected in October 2016 after more than a two-year presidential vacuum, is a close ally of Hezbollah.

As U.S. and Saudi Arabia sought ways to curb Iran's growing influence in the region, Hariri has come under pressure to distance himself from the militant group which has sent thousands of troops to neighboring Syria to shore up President Bashar Assad's forces.

It was not immediately clear whether Hariri intended to return to Lebanon. In a statement, the presidential office said Aoun was informed by Hariri in a phone call of his resignation, adding that the president now awaits Hariri's return to clarify the circumstances of his resignation and proceed accordingly.

Hariri's bombshell resignation — even close aides seemed unaware of the announcement — ushers in a stage of deep uncertainty and potential instability. It also throws into doubt parliamentary elections slated for early next year which have been repeatedly delayed.

It comes amid a sharp escalation in Saudi rhetoric against its regional archrival Iran and puts Lebanon at the center of that rivalry.

Hazem al-Amin, a Lebanese writer who follows regional affairs, said Hariri's resignation is ""completely a Saudi step"" that comes in the context of an international and regional atmosphere against Hezbollah and against Iranian influence in the region.

""Lebanon is a fragile country. This confrontation (between Saudi Arabia and Iran) is more violent than Lebanon can stand up to,"" he said, warning of economic and security ramifications.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said the resignation is a plot by the U.S., Israel and the Saudis to foment tensions in Lebanon and the region, the semi-official Iranian Tasnim news agency reported.

Ghasemi dismissed Hariri's ""baseless accusations,"" which he said indicate that ""a new scenario"" for the region was being drawn.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hariri's resignation and comments ""are a wake-up call to the international community to take action against the Iranian aggression that is trying to turn Syria into Lebanon 2.""

""This aggression endangers not only Israel but the entire Middle East. The international community needs to come together and stand against this aggression,"" he said.

Hariri's resignation was unprecedented in the way it was announced, in a televised address from an undisclosed location in Riyadh. In his speech, Hariri suggested he feared for his life and said the climate in the country is similar to the one that existed before his father, the late prime minister Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in 2005.

Several Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia for the killing by a U.N.-backed tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. Hezbollah denies any involvement.

Hariri said Hezbollah's policies have put Lebanon ""in the eye of the storm."" His attacks on Hezbollah come on the heels of new U.S. sanctions on the group that many fear will impact negatively on the Lebanese economy. Hariri has frequently called on the group to withdraw its fighters from Syria.

""I declare my resignation from the premiership of the Lebanese government, with the certainty that the will of the Lebanese is strong,"" Hariri said.

""When I took office, I promised you that I would seek to unite the Lebanese and end political division... But unfortunately, this pushed Iran and its allies to more interference in our internal affairs,"" he said.

In Beirut's Tarik al-Jadideh neighborhood, a predominantly Sunni neighborhood supportive of Hariri, residents described the shock resignation as a positive step.

""Prime Minister Hariri has reached the stage where he is not able anymore to bear the pressure on Lebanon by Arab nations, due to the intervention of Iran,"" said Mohyeddine Awwad, sitting in a cafe where posters of Hariri hung.

Earlier this week, Saudi State Minister for Gulf Affairs Thamer al-Sabhan sharply criticized Hezbollah, calling for its ""toppling"" and promising ""astonishing developments"" in the coming days during an interview with the Lebanese TV station MTV.

Al-Sabhan met with Hariri in Saudi Arabia when the now resigned prime minister was visiting earlier this week. Hariri abruptly returned to the kingdom again on Friday after a meeting in Beirut with Ali-Akbar Velayati, foreign adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader.

In tweets after meeting Hariri, al-Sabhan criticized the Lebanese government for tolerating Hezbollah's criticism of the kingdom.

Maha Yahya, director of the Beirut-based Carnegie Middle East, said that with the Syrian war calming down, Hariri's move could be a message from Saudi Arabia to Iran that it ""can't have it all.""

""So Lebanon is back on the table as a stage for the next tug of war,"" she said.

US President Donald Trump said no nation should underestimate American resolve, as he arrived in Japan at the start of a marathon Asian tour.

Addressing US troops at Yokota air base near Tokyo, he pledged to ensure the military had the resources needed to keep peace and defend freedom.

Mr Trump's visit comes amid heightened tensions with North Korea over its nuclear programme and missile tests.

It will be the longest tour of Asia by a US president in 25 years.

""No-one, no dictator, no regime... should underestimate American resolve,"" President Trump told cheering US and Japanese troops shortly after his arrival in Japan.

Mr Trump went on to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for lunch before the two leaders played a round of golf.

Stops in South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines are also on the itinerary in the coming week.

En route to Japan, the president stopped in Hawaii where he visited the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor - the scene of the 1941 Japanese attack that drew the US into World War Two.

He also took part in a briefing at the US Pacific Command.

Mr Trump has previously exchanged some fiery rhetoric with North Korea over its ballistic missile tests but aides said earlier this week that he would not go to the heavily fortified demilitarised zone (DMZ) on the border between the South and North.

He is, however, to visit Camp Humphreys, a US military complex south of the capital, Seoul.

In Vietnam, Mr Trump will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Da Nang and make a state visit to Hanoi.

His final engagement is scheduled to be a summit of South-East Asian nations in the Philippine capital, Manila, on 13 November but the trip has now been extended by an extra day so he can attend the East Asia Summit.

The last time a US president made such a marathon trip to Asia was when George HW Bush visited the region in late 1991 and early 1992.

A new Saudi anti-corruption body has detained 11 princes, four sitting ministers and dozens of former ministers, media reports say.

The detentions came hours after the new committee, headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was formed by royal decree.

Those detained were not named.

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says Prince Mohammed is moving to consolidate his growing power while spearheading a reform programme.

It is not clear what those detained are suspected of. However, Saudi broadcaster Al-Arabiya said fresh investigations had been launched into the 2009 Jeddah floods and the outbreak of the Mers virus which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

The new anti-corruption committee has the power to issue arrest warrants and travel bans, the state-owned Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.

Separately, the heads of the Saudi National Guard and the navy were replaced in a series of high-profile sackings.

SPA said King Salman had dismissed National Guard minister Prince Miteb bin Abdullah and navy commander Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan.

No official explanation was given for their removal.

Prince Miteb, son of the late King Abdullah, was once seen as a contender for the throne and was the last member of Abdullah's branch of the family at the highest echelons of Saudi government.

Our correspondent says Prince Mohammed, who already serves as defence minister, now has nominal control over all the country's security forces.

Prince Mohammed recently said the return of ""moderate Islam"" was key to his plans to modernise Saudi Arabia.

Addressing an economic conference in Riyadh, he vowed to ""eradicate the remnants of extremism very soon"".

Last year, Prince Mohammed unveiled a wide-ranging plan to bring social and economic change to the oil-dependent kingdom."

Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull has turned down a renewed offer from New Zealand to resettle some refugees from a Papua New Guinea detention centre.

About 600 men are refusing to leave a decommissioned Australian centre on Manus island saying they fear attacks from locals.

Mr Turnbull said he would not, at this time, take up the offer from New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern.

The two leaders held talks in Sydney on Sunday.

Ms Ardern had said she could not ignore ""the human face"" of what Australia was dealing with.

Under a controversial policy, Australia refuses to take in any asylum seekers trying to reach its territories unofficially by boat. Those who arrive are placed in camps on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea (PNG), and on the Pacific island of Nauru.

New Zealand first said it would take 150 of the asylum seekers in 2013, but the offer has been repeatedly rejected by Canberra.

The BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney says Mr Turnbull is keen to pursue a deal reached last year with the US, which agreed to resettle hundreds of migrants from the offshore Australian camps.

Australia withdrew from the Manus Island centre on Tuesday, following a PNG court ruling that the centre was unconstitutional.

The men - most of whom have refugee status - have now lost access to running water, electricity and working toilets, and their food supplies are dwindling. They have begun digging into the ground to find water and set up catchments to collect rain.

The UN refugee agency has said some of the alternative accommodation allocated for the men is not ready.

The agency and rights groups have warned that the men have legitimate fears for their safety, and that attacks on asylum seekers have occurred in the past in PNG.

Iran says the surprise resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri is part of a plot to stoke tensions in the region.

An adviser to Iran's supreme leader accused the US and Saudi Arabia of being behind the move.

Mr Hariri, in a televised broadcast from Saudi Arabia, accused Iran of sowing ""fear and destruction"" in several countries, including Lebanon.

He said he was stepping down because he feared for his life.

Mr Hariri's father, former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, was assassinated in 2005.

Correspondents say his sudden departure plunges Lebanon into a new political crisis and raises fears that it may be at the forefront of the regional rivalry between Shia power Iran and Sunni stronghold Saudi Arabia.

Following the statement on Saturday, Iranian politicians lined up to denounce Mr Hariri's assertions.

""Hariri's resignation was done with planning by [US President] Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,"" said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Kahmenei.

Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi, quoted by the official Irna news agency, said Mr Hariri's departure was aimed at creating tension in Lebanon and the region.

He said Mr Hariri had repeated ""unrealistic and unfounded accusations"" and had aligned himself with ""those who want ill for the region"", singling out Israel, Saudi Arabia and the US.

Mr Hariri, whose family is close to Saudi Arabia, has been prime minister since December 2016, after previously holding the position between 2009 and 2011.

""We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri,"" he said in the broadcast from the Saudi capital Riyadh.

""I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life.""

Rafik al-Hariri was killed by a bomb in 2005 in an attack widely blamed on the Iran-backed Shia movement Hezbollah, which wields considerable power in Lebanon.

Addressing ""Iran and its followers"" he said Lebanon would ""cut off the hands that wickedly extend into it"".

Mr Hariri has made several recent visits to Saudi Arabia. His announcement came a day after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

After taking office last year, Mr Hariri promised a ""new era for Lebanon"" after two years of political deadlock.

The coalition government he led brought together almost all of the main political parties in Lebanon, including Hezbollah."

Catalan ex-leader Carles Puigdemont has called for separatist parties to unite in upcoming regional elections to continue a push for independence.

The snap poll was called by Spain after the Catalan parliament declared independence and Madrid reacted by imposing direct rule.

Mr Puigdemont's appeal came a day after a Spanish judge issued an EU warrant for his arrest - he is in Belgium.

Despite being sought by the courts, he says he is ready to run in the poll.

Four of his allies in Belgium also face possible extradition, while eight other former officials remain in custody in Spain.

They all face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds for pursuing Catalan independence. There have been large demonstrations in Catalan cities in protest.

Mr Puigdemont has said he will not return to Spain unless he receives guarantees of a fair trial.

He says he can campaign in the December 21 election from outside Catalonia and the Spanish government has said that any accused politician can run in the election unless they are actually convicted, the Associated Press reports.

In a tweet on Saturday, he said it was time ""for all democrats to unite. For Catalonia, for the freedom of political prisoners and for the republic.""

He included a link to an online petition calling for secessionist parties to unite against Madrid in the regional vote. The petition now has more than 39,000 signatures.

Belgian authorities, meanwhile, are reviewing the arrest warrants issued by the Spanish judge.

The process could take up to three months ""under exceptional circumstances"", the justice ministry said.

The other warrants are for:

Meritxell Serret, former agriculture minister

Antoni Comín, former health minister

Lluís Puig, former culture minister

Clara Ponsatí, former education minister

Spain issues warrant for Catalan ex-leader

Five senior members of the Catalan parliament, as well as Speaker Carme Forcadell, are facing the same charges but, because of their parliamentary immunity, their cases are being handled by the Supreme Court. Their hearings have been postponed until 9 November.

The regional parliament in Catalonia voted to proclaim an independent republic just over a week ago, following an illegal referendum on independence organised by the Catalan government on 1 October

No other country recognised the move and the Spanish central government moved swiftly to impose control, using emergency powers under the constitution."

Saudi Arabia says it has intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen, after a loud explosion was heard near Riyadh airport on Saturday evening.

The missile was destroyed over the capital and fragments landed in the airport area, officials quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency said.

A TV channel linked to Houthi rebels in Yemen said the missile was fired at the King Khalid International Airport.

The civil aviation authority said that air traffic was not disrupted.

Saudi forces have reported shooting down Houthi missiles in the past , though none has come so close to a major population centre.

""The missile was launched indiscriminately to target the civilian and populated areas,"" said Turki al-Maliki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen.

""Shattered fragments from the intercepted missile landed in an uninhabited area of the airport and there were no injuries.""

Witnesses reported seeing parts of the missile in the airport's car park, Saudi broadcaster Al-Arabiya reported.

Residents in the north of Riyadh said their windows were rattled by a loud blast on Saturday evening that was followed by the roar of low-flying aircraft.

The Houthi-run Saba News in Yemen said the missile had been a Burkan H2.

The rebel group is believed to have access to a stockpile of Scud ballistic missiles and home-grown variants. Saudi forces have previously brought them down with Patriot surface-to-air missiles bought from the US.

The Houthis fired a missile towards Riyadh in May, a day before US President Donald Trump was due to arrive in the city for a visit, but it was shot down 200km (120 miles) from the capital.

Yemen has been devastated by a war between forces loyal to the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and those allied to the Houthi rebel movement.

Saudi Arabia is leading a campaign to defeat the Houthis, and is the biggest power in an international air coalition that has bombed the rebel group since 2015.

On Wednesday a suspected strike by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 26 people at a hotel and market in northern Yemen, medics and local officials said.

The coalition, which rights groups say has bombed schools, hospitals, markets and residential areas, said it struck a ""legitimate military target"".

UN-brokered talks have failed to bring an end to the bloodshed in Yemen, which has claimed more than 8,600 lives and injured nearly 50,000 since the Saudi-led campaign began.

The conflict has also left 20.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is believed to have affected 884,000 people and caused 2,184 deaths."

Syrian pro-government forces backed by Russian airpower are advancing rapidly towards a border town still held by the Islamic State (IS) group.

A day after taking full control of the city of Deir al-Zour, the Syrian military is mounting an offensive to recapture the town of Albu Kamal.

Reports suggest IS fighters fled there from the Iraqi side of the border.

An Iraqi Shia Muslim militia has said it will cross into Syria to join the assault on Albu Kamal.

It is a sign of how dramatically IS territory has shrunk in the past few weeks that this town on the border with Iraq appears to be one of the jihadists' last redoubts, the BBC's Sebastian Usher reports.

It is unclear how much co-ordination there could be between Iraqi and Syrian pro-government forces but the aim appears to be to deny IS fighters - and presumably their surviving commanders - the chance of escaping into the remote desert wastes as their self-declared caliphate crumbles into dust, our Arab affairs editor adds.

Dangerous encounters

By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent

Russia, after Iran, is the other great winner from the Syrian conflict, reviving its role in the region, securing important military bases, and making itself a key diplomatic player.

It wants to ""solve"" Syria on its terms and with its favoured actors ending up the victors and it seems to be well on the way to achieving this goal.

But the growing proximity of Russian and Iranian-backed pro-regime forces and those backed by the US raises the possibility of some dangerous encounters. The US and Russia can agree on the need to defeat IS but on little else. Moscow's ""side"" has the military and diplomatic advantage on the ground.

Will the US seek to bolster its position in Syria, perhaps as part of a broader policy to ""roll back"" Iranian influence, as US conservatives are hoping? This may be easier said than done and might require many more resources and boots on the ground than the Trump administration is prepared to put in harm's way.

Full analysis

On Friday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced that the Iraqi border town of al-Qaim, close to Albu Kamal, had been recaptured by government forces.

The same day, the Syrian government said it had retaken Deir al-Zour, capital of the region of the same name in which Albu Kamal is located.

Russia released video of bombers in action and missiles being launched from a submarine in strikes targeting the Albu Kamal area.

A spokesman for the Kataib Hezbollah militia, an Iranian-backed Iraqi group fighting alongside the Iraqi army against IS, told Lebanese TV the group would join the fight for the town across the border.

""Albu Kamal is in missile range of the Iraqi forces in al-Qaim,"" Jaafar Hussaini was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.

""The presence of our forces on the border with Albu Kamal means there will be a new front in the confrontation with Daesh [another name for IS].""

IS, a Sunni Muslim jihadist group, overran swathes of Iraqi and Syrian territory in 2014 and enforced its rule through ruthless suppression of its enemies, earning international condemnation for its cruelty.

It has also claimed responsibility for numerous attacks outside he region, notably the downing of a Russian airliner over Egypt with the deaths of all 224 people aboard in October 2015 and the killing of 130 people in a gun and bomb attack on Paris two weeks later."

Former US Republican President George Bush Sr has confirmed he voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, labelling Donald Trump a ""blowhard"".

His son, George W Bush, said he worries that ""I will be the last Republican president"", even though President Trump is a Republican.

""This guy doesn't know what it means to be president,"" the younger man said.

The pair's comments come from a new book, titled The Last Republicans.

Preview excerpts from the book were published by US media outlets.

""Blowhard"" is a casual term for a person who is boastful or blustering, the Oxford English Dictionary says, and it is usually meant as an insult.

""I don't like him. I don't know much about him, but I know he's a blowhard. And I'm not too excited about him being a leader,"" said George Bush Sr, who was president between 1989 and 1993.

He also told the author of the book, Mark Updegrove, that he felt Mr Trump ran for the presidency because he had ""a certain ego"", in remarks reported by US media outlets including CNN and the New York Times.

George W Bush, adding to his remarks that Mr Trump ""doesn't know what it means to be president,"" said ""you can either exploit the anger, incite it, or you can come up with ideas to deal with it.""

The younger Bush's comments are in keeping with a speech he gave in late October widely seen as a critique of the new president, though it did not name him.

Voting for Clinton

During the 2016 presidential campaign, neither former president endorsed Donald Trump.

But in the new book, George Bush Sr confirmed that he voted for the rival party's candidate in Hillary Clinton.

George W Bush, however, said he simply left his presidential ballot blank.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption George W Bush - pictured with Mrs Clinton at Mr Trump's inauguration - left his ballot blank

The book's title, Mr Updegrove told CNN, came from a remark made by George W Bush during the presidential election.

As the previous Republican president before Barack Obama took office, he told the author: ""You know, I fear that I will be the last Republican president.""

""And it wasn't just about Hillary Clinton becoming president, as the Republican Party was having a difficult time finding itself. It was because Donald Trump represented everything that the Bushes abhorred,"" Mr Updegrove told CNN.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders hit back at the former presidents in a statement.

""The American people voted to elect an outsider who is capable of implementing real, positive, and needed change - instead of a lifelong politician beholden to special interests,"" she said.

""If they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won.""

Meanwhile, former head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, has claimed she seriously considered replacing Hillary Clinton with Vice-President Joe Biden as the party's presidential candidate during the campaign.

In extracts from her own book published by the Washington Post, she said Mrs Clinton's campaign had ""the odour of failure"" and alleges a huge array of failures and incidents of mismanagement within the party.

Ms Brazile was herself at the centre of a controversy when she fed the Clinton campaign a question in advance of a debate against Bernie Sanders during the race for the Democratic nomination."

A secret FBI dossier on civil rights leader Martin Luther King alleges that he had a string of affairs and other ""sexual aberrations"", as well as links to the Communist Party.

It is dated just three weeks before Dr King's assassination in April 1968.

The file was released in a tranche of documents relating to the assassination of John F Kennedy released on Friday.

Mr Kennedy is not referenced in the file and it is not clear why it was kept secret for almost 50 years.

There is no evidence that any of the claims in the report were verified.

Its cover shows it was assessed in 1994 by an FBI task force on the JFK assassination, which concluded none of the document should be released.

Many of the allegations contained in the paper appear to be reports of private conversations between others, or hearsay reported third-hand.

One allegation, that King had a mistress in California with whom he fathered a child, was attributed to ""a very responsible Los Angeles individual in a position to know"".

Among its other accusations are that:

Dr King was surrounded by advisers with strong links to the Communist Party USA

His statements were always subject to approval by the alleged communist sympathisers

He was a secret supporter of communism, ""a whole-hearted Marxist""

His organisation, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, set up a ""tax dodge"" to raise funds for its activities

Dr King took part in ""drunken sex orgies"" and coerced young women to participate

He had love affairs with at least four women, including folk singer Joan Baez

The list of alleged indiscretions would likely have been deeply problematic for the civil rights leader if it had been made public in 1968.

Image copyright US Gov Image caption Much of the document aims to paint Dr King as a tool of the communist party

The paper paints Dr King in an extremely negative light, despite his receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize and his contribution to passing the Civil Rights Act four years previously.

It is not entirely clear why the dossier was commissioned. But several pages of the 20-page document are concerned with Mr King's upcoming ""Washington Spring project"" which was scheduled for the coming months.

It warned that despite Dr King's history of calling for peaceful protest, ""the combined forces of the communist influence and the black nationalists advocating violence give the 'Washington Spring Project' a potential for an extremely explosive situation.""

Dr King was killed before the planned march.

A 'slow thinker' with 'abnormal' sexual preferences

Despite Dr King's historical reputation as a skilled speaker, the FBI file claimed that other advisers approved everything Mr King said.

""King is such a slow thinker he is usually not prepared to make statements without help from someone,"" it reads.

Linking Dr King to communism, it claimed:

""King is a whole-hearted Marxist who has studied it (Marxism), believes in it and agrees with it, but because of his being a minister of religion, does no dare to espouse it publicly.""

And in another part says: ""During the early 1960s, the CPUSA [the communist party] was striving to obtain a Negro-labor coalition to achieve its goals in this country… Martin Luther King, Jr, and his organisation were made to order to achieve these objectives.""

The most salacious claims about Dr King's sex life are contained in a dense collection of rumours in the final two pages.

Image copyright US Gov Image caption Dr King's alleged sexual misconduct is tacked on to the end of the file

At a February 1968 workshop to train ministers in urban leadership, it is alleged: ""One Negro minister in attendance later expressed his disgust with the behind-the scene drinking, fornication, and homosexuality that went on at the conference.""

""Several Negro and white prostitute[s] were brought in from the Miami area. An all-night sex orgy was held with these prostitutes and some of the delegates.""

The document alleged that Dr King also engaged in a ""two-day drunken sex orgy"" in Washington in January 1964.

""When one of the females shied away from engaging in an unnatural act, King and other of the males present discussed how she was to be taught and initiated in this respect,"" it added.

""It is a fact that King not only regularly indulges in adulterous acts but enjoys the abnormal by engaging in group sexual orgies."""

Deontay Wilder told Anthony Joshua ""I declare war upon you"" after retaining his WBC heavyweight title with a first round knockout of Bermane Stiverne.

Wilder knocked Stiverne to the canvas with a fierce right before flooring him again with a barrage of punches.

Stiverne was then knocked out as Wilder caught him with some brutal punches, including a left-right combination.

""I know I am the best. Are you up for the test?,"" asked Wilder of WBA and IBF heavyweight champion Joshua.

""I've been waiting on that fight for a long time now.

""I declare war upon you. Do you accept my challenge?""

American Wilder appeared to dismiss the prospect of fighting Britain's Dillian Whyte, who last weekend won an eliminator to put himself in a prime position to compete for a world title by claiming the vacant WBC silver heavyweight crown.

Whyte has racked up six successive victories since losing to Anthony Joshua in December 2015, and after Wilder's win wrote on Twitter: ""Well done @BronzeBomber but let's do this work Feb 3 at the O2. I ain't never scared, fact. Will fight anyone anytime.""

However, Wilder said: ""They are trying to give me a peasant in Whyte. A king doesn't chase the peasants. A king takes kings. I want Joshua. If he doesn't give me the fight we have other plans,"" added Wilder.

""The world wants Joshua, the world wants Wilder, I want Joshua. Joshua come and see me baby. No more dodging, no more excuses. Make the date, don't wait. Let's see who is the best.""

Wilder was taken the full distance for the only time in his career when he beat Stiverne on points to claim the WBC belt in January 2015.

This time around he finished the fight with seconds left in the opening round as he took his undefeated record to 39, 38 by way of knockout."

Brendan Rodgers says it is an ""incredible feat"" for his Celtic side to break the club's own British record of 62 domestic games undefeated.

The manager paid tribute to Willie Maley's 1917 team, who were surpassed after a 4-0 win away to St Johnstone.

""Celtic holding that British record, it is special,"" said Rodgers.

""It is an incredible feat by the players and a wonderful example of professionalism, of playing and creating high standards every day.""

Rodgers, a childhood Celtic fan, stressed that it was particularly special considering the quality of the side who had created the previous record 100 years ago.

""If you look back at that team Willie Maley had, I grew up being aware of players from that era, like Patsy Gallacher, so that tells you the level of quality of that team,"" he told BBC Scotland before hailing the present side.

""They have faced everything as football players - going behind in games, playing on dodgy surfaces, playing on Astroturf pitches, being tired after games, going behind in games, semi-finals, finals.

""It hasn't just happened overnight. It is something that's been created - a mentality and a desire to work.

Celtic's players celebrated with their fans at McDiarmid Park

""The level of consistency is absolutely remarkable. As the run goes on, teams increase their level even more.

""Every game against Celtic is a massive game. Everyone wants to be the team that beats Celtic.""

Celtic won the domestic treble last season and Rodgers realises that some are predicting they can go another season undefeated by a Scottish team.

""People will look at that and think yes because of the consistency and level, but it only takes something to happen in the game for it to go against you - a bad decision or make a mistake,"" he said.

""But we don't tend to think about that. If you worry about that and you try to forecast what you will do in football, it is dangerous territory.

""My job is to ensure that the players are never complacent.""

Rodgers recognises that the run will come to an end eventually.

""That will happen at some point, but how the players are coping with that and the level of their football is admirable,"" he said.

St Johnstone drop to seventh place on goal difference behind Hearts, but manager Tommy Wright stressed the difference in resources between his club and Celtic.

""They have better players and are better all over the park and I can't be too critical of my players,"" he said.

""You have to say Celtic are at a different level even against the bigger clubs in this league and certainly at a different level to a club of our size.""

Saints have now gone six games without scoring, but Wright did not think the heads had gone down.

""I don't think it is a lack of belief,"" he said. ""I just think we're making the wrong decisions at the minute.

""There were a couple of opportunities on the break in the second half where the final pass let us down.

""There were rumours not so long ago that Slaven had two or three matches left and no contract extension pointed to the first 10 games being the most important,"" said the ex-England boss, who was in charge of the Hammers for four years before leaving ""by mutual consent"" in 2015.

""The owners have backed Slaven and spent a considerable amount of money.

""The players have lost their way because of constant changes. When you're searching for wins and draws you change the team. At this moment he looks so dejected.

""Structurally, they're not well coached.""

'I never hide'

In his news conference after Saturday's game, it was jokingly suggested to Bilic that he should turn off his phone to avoid a call from Gold or Sullivan.

But the Croat said he would take responsibility for the club's poor form and was ready for the consequences.

""I will face the situation and the consequences,"" he said. ""I never hide.

""I am the one taking the bullets all the time, when I do and don't have to. What is out of the question is how strong a character I am.

""But are we playing well? No we are not.

""No matter when it happens, sooner or later, if it's tonight, in one week, at the end of the season or in five years, I'm going to be very proud of what we've done in two and a half years.""

'We are letting Bilic down'

Aaron Cresswell lost possession 18 times against Liverpool - only Joe Hart (21) had a worse record

Left-back Aaron Cresswell, exposed as the last man for the first and third Liverpool goals, said the squad were failing their manager.

""Are we letting the manager down? Definitely, every player included,"" he told Match of the Day.

""It is not good enough as a team collectively. We need to ease the pressure off the gaffer and ourselves.

""Confidence is low. It's not easy being at the bottom of the table. We saw the fans leaving at the end and that's down to the way we are playing. We need to turn this mess around."""

Britain's Jamie McDonnell retained his WBA world bantamweight title as his rematch with Liborio Solis ended in a technical draw after a clash of heads.

McDonnell, 31, was left covered in blood after sustaining a cut above his left eye, and the fight in Monte Carlo was stopped in the third round.

As four rounds had not been completed, the bout was declared a no-contest.

McDonnell said afterwards this was his last fight in the division, and that he will move up to super-bantamweight.

Venezuela's Solis, who lost a controversial points decision to McDonnell at Salle des Etoiles in Monte Carlo a year ago, made the more purposeful start in the opulent surroundings of Le Casino in the heart of the principality.

The 35-year-old bloodied McDonnell's nose in round two, and when it became clear the champion's cut would soon end proceedings, both men launched into a flurry of punches.

""I knew they were going to stop it so I came out for a knockout,"" a distraught McDonnell told Sky Sports. ""If it had gone another round, I felt I would have done it.

""I feel like crying, I'm disappointed because I know how good I could be.

""I wanted to finish with a bang before I move up but that's my last fight at bantamweight. I'll enjoy Christmas, see if I can get a straight shot at super-bantamweight, or see what else comes up.""

The Yorkshireman has lost only two bouts and remains undefeated since 2008.

Acting on orders from a newly established anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, security forces arrested 11 princes, four ministers and dozens of former ministers, according to Saudi media and a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Prince Miteb, son of the late King Abdullah, was removed from his post as head of the powerful National Guards. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world’s richest men, was picked up at his desert camp, the senior official said. Authorities did not disclose the evidence that prompted the arrests.

“Laws will be applied firmly on everyone who touched public money and didn’t protect it or embezzled it, or abused their power and influence,” King Salman said in comments shown on state TV. “This will be applied on those big and small, and we will fear no one.”

Prince Miteb was replaced by Prince Khaled Ayyaf, according to a royal decree. Before his ouster, he was one of the few remaining senior royals to have survived a series of cabinet shuffles that promoted allies of the crown prince, who is the direct heir to the throne.

Meteoric Rise

King Salman had already sidelined other senior members of the royal family to prevent any opposition to the crown prince, 32-year-old Prince Mohammed, known as MBS among diplomats and journalists, who replaced his elder cousin, Muhammed bin Nayef, in June. That maneuver removed any doubt of how succession plans will unfold following the reign of King Salman, now 81.

“The hardline approach is risky because it will solidify the dislike many powerful Saudis have for the crown prince, but it is likely that MBS succeeds, and emerges from this episode more empowered,” Hani Sabra, founder of Alef Advisory, a Middle East political risk practice, wrote in a note. “We can’t confidently project when a leadership transition will take place, but today’s developments are a signpost that MBS is moving toward the role of king. ”

Changing the head of the National Guard, an institution that’s been controlled by the clan of the late King Abdullah, “is not like changing the minister of oil,” said Kamran Bokhari, a senior analyst with Geopolitical Futures and a senior fellow with the Center for Global Policy. “I wouldn’t be surprised if this leads to greater fissures within the royal family.”

Alwaleed’s Surprise

Detaining Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of King Salman, was another surprising development. The prince has, more than once, expressed his public support to the monarch and his son. When Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran in 2016, the prince said he was halting plans to invest in the Islamic Republic. On National Day in September, a giant picture of Prince Mohammed was projected on Alwaleed’s Kingdom Tower in Riyadh during a firework display.

A spokesman for the prince’s Kingdom Holding didn’t immediately respond to calls and emails seeking comment. The company’s shares plummeted 9.9 percent, while the benchmark Tadawul All Share Index declined 1.4 percent at 10:55 a.m. in Riyadh.

In the course of his meteoric rise to power since 2015, Prince Mohammed prince has announced plans to sell a stake in oil giant Saudi Aramco and create the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, and has ended some social constraints, including a long-standing ban on female drivers. Women will be allowed to drive in June 2018.

Saudi Arabia, while never a democracy, had been governed for decades by a loose consensus among an extended royal family, who had control over different government agencies. Critics said the system had stifled any attempts to reform the kingdom to reduce the economy’s reliance on oil.

Total Control

Since his father’s ascension to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed has emerged as the dominant figure in the desert kingdom. He controls almost all the levers of government, from the Defense Ministry to the central bank and the oil giant Aramco, which bankrolls the country. He’s also announced radical plans to sell state businesses, cut the public payroll and step up a regional power struggle against Iran.

The king also replaced Economy and Planning Minister Adel Fakeih with Mohammad Al Tuwaijri, his deputy.

Al Tuwaijri, formerly vice minister for economy and planning, had already played a key role in shaping Saudi economic and fiscal policy over the past year. Before joining the government in May 2016, he was Middle East chief executive for HSBC Holding Plc. He’s served as a frequent spokesman for the government’s economic reform plan on TV and with Western journalists.

“These things are happening methodically and carefully with lots of pre-planning it seems,” said Paul Sullivan, a Middle East specialist at Georgetown University in Washington. “Some real political operators are mentoring this. If the economy and jobs don’t bring lots of changes there could be some pushback.”

The anti-corruption committee’s powers include the ability to trace funds and assets, and prevent their transfer or liquidation on behalf of individuals or entities, along with the right to take any precautionary actions until cases are referred to relevant investigatory or judiciary authorities, according to a government statement.

The committee’s formation was deemed necessary “due to the propensity of some people for abuse, putting their personal interest above public interest, and stealing public funds,” the Royal Order said.

Speaking to U.S. and Japanese military personnel on Sunday at Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo, Trump said he would push for freedom in the region and fair trade in meetings with other leaders. He also exuded confidence in the U.S. military as tensions rise with North Korea.

“We dominate the sky, we dominate the sea, we dominate the land and space,” Trump said. “No one -- no dictator, no regime and no nation -- should underestimate ever American resolve. Every once in a while in the past they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it.”

Concerns over provocations from North Korea have risen as Kim Jong Un’s regime continues to develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in defiance of international sanctions. Trump has threatened military action to stop Pyongyang from obtaining the ability to strike the continental U.S. with a nuclear weapon.

“As long as I am president, the service men and women who defend our nation will have the equipment, the resources and the funding they need to secure our homeland, to respond to our enemies quickly and decisively, and when necessary to fight, to overpower, and to always, always, always win,” he said.

After speaking to troops, Trump met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for a round of golf. The two leaders are scheduled to have a private dinner on Sunday night ahead of more formal meetings and a joint press briefing on Monday. He is scheduled to head to South Korea on Tuesday morning.

Here’s What Trump Must Get Done on High Stakes Asia Trip

In his remarks on Sunday, Trump called Japan a “treasured partner and crucial ally” of the U.S. He also spoke to troops more broadly about what he hoped to accomplish on his trip through Asia.

“We will seek new opportunities for cooperation and commerce, and we will partner with friends and allies to pursue a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” he said. “We will seek free, fair and reciprocal trade. But this future is only within our grasp because of you.”

During an interview Thursday with Fox News, Trump said the citizens of Japan “should be worried” by their proximity to North Korea.

“I tell everyone else that, listen, you’re going to have yourself a big problem with Japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with North Korea,” Trump said.

Abe’s party was re-elected in a general election last month after pledging a hard line on North Korea and a push to change Japan’s pacifist constitution written after World War II. He has been one of Trump’s most reliable allies in dealing with Kim, emphasizing the need for pressure over dialogue.

“The president recognizes that we’re running out of time and will ask all nations to do more,” White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters on Thursday.

Trade Deficit

The U.S. and Japan entered a security agreement in 1960, and an estimated 50,000 U.S. personnel are stationed in the country. Japan spent $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2015 as part of the cost of hosting the U.S. military.

During the presidential campaign, Trump called on Japan to significantly increase its contribution to funding American bases like Yokota.

“Of course they should pick up all the expense,” Trump said in an interview with CNN in May 2016. “Why are we paying for this?”

Asked if the president stood by his assertion during a background briefing for reporters, a senior administration official said it would be up to the Japanese people to decide, but that the U.S. would seek continued burden sharing as defense systems to protect Japan were updated.

Trump has also hit out at Japan over a bilateral trade deficit that hit $69 billion last year, the U.S.’s second-largest behind China. Japan has sought to salvage the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that Trump withdrew from shortly after taking office."
"Andrew M Harris, David Voreacos","Paul Manafort, the indicted former campaign chairman of President Donald Trump, explained in a pre-trial court filing why he traveled to China and other countries with a mobile phone registered to an alias, and why he had three passports.",2017-11-04T22:06:04.667Z,bloomberg,"Manafort Explains Mysterious Phone, Why He Had Three Passports",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-04/manafort-offers-8-million-in-property-as-collateral-for-liberty,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/inDBfpskQcOU/v0/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Paul Manafort, the indicted former campaign chairman of President Donald Trump, explained in a pre-trial court filing why he traveled to China and other countries with a mobile phone registered to an alias, and why he had three passports.

Prosecutors cited the phone and multiple passports in saying that Manafort posed a risk of fleeing the U.S. after his Oct. 27 indictment on charges that he and his right-hand man, Rick Gates, concealed their work as agents of Ukraine, laundered millions of dollars and hid offshore accounts.

“While some reports have painted this as though Mr. Manafort is akin to a 68-year-old ‘Jason Bourne’ character, the facts are much more mundane,” his attorneys said, referring to the fictional former CIA assassin created by novelist Robert Ludlum, and portrayed in several movies by actor Matt Damon.

In the filing on Saturday, Manafort’s lawyers asked a judge to modify the bail terms while offering to post $12.5 million in assets and arguing he poses no risk of flight. They said Manafort traveled to China and elsewhere with a phone registered to an alias -- his brother’s name -- because he wanted to maintain confidentiality while working as a political consultant to high-profile clients.

Phone Alias

“It is common practice for many U.S. citizens who travel abroad on business and pleasure to defend themselves against potential hacking, and confiscation, of their electronic devices and data,” Manafort’s lawyers wrote in the filing in federal court in Washington. This doesn’t show a “heightened potential for risk of flight,” they said.

Manafort had one passport for travel and a second one “to submit with visa applications to certain foreign countries,” according to his lawyers, Kevin Downing and Thomas Zehnle. He lost the first passport and obtained a third one before finding the original one months later, at which point he told the State Department about his discovery.

Manafort and Gates were among the first people charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who’s investigating Russian influence on the 2016 presidential election. Both Manafort, who faces up as many as 15 1/2 years in prison, and Gates, who faces 12 1/2 years, pleaded not guilty on Oct. 30. They’re confined to their homes and subject to electronic monitoring.

Manafort may owe $10 million if he violates his release terms, while Gates could owe $5 million if he violates his terms. Both have asked for relaxed terms, and U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson will hear their arguments on Monday.

Manafort’s Pledges

In his filing, Manafort asked that he be allowed to travel to Washington, New York, Virginia and Florida, which was described as his primary residence. He pledged not to travel overseas. He also offered to pledge his $3 million apartment in Trump Tower in New York; a $3.5 million apartment in lower Manhattan; a $1.5 million home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida; and life insurance policies worth $4.5 million.

Manafort’s lawyers gave some hints about his financial condition. They said the $18 million in assets that prosecutors seek to seize if he’s convicted “would wipe out a substantial portion of Mr. Manafort’s wealth accumulated over a lifetime of work.”

They also said that accounts in Cyprus that are the focus of much of the indictment “have been closed or have relatively nominal balances” because his work in Ukraine ended in 2014.

Prosecutors haven’t agreed to the terms as Manafort has had some difficulty assembling supporting documentation, according to the filing. The Mueller team’s response is due Sunday.

The case is U.S. v. Manafort, 17-cr-201, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington)."

A majority of voters in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll say Donald Trump has achieved little in the first year after his upset win in the 2016 presidential election, yet most think the Democratic Party isn’t presenting alternatives.

Trump’s approval rating stood at 37 percent, the lowest for any president at this point in their first term in polling data going back to 1946, ABC said on Sunday. Half of those who disapprove do so “strongly,” another high -- and twice as many say they strongly approve of Trump’s performance.

The president logged big deficits on a number of key issues and personal attributes. Some 55 percent say he’s not delivering on major campaign promises, up from 41 percent at his 100-day mark in April.

Views of Trump as a strong leader have dropped to 40 percent now from 53 percent at 100 days. And as Trump travels to Asia, fully two-thirds of those surveyed don’t trust him to act responsibly in handling the situation with a nuclear-armed North Korea. A small majority -- 53 percent -- say America’s leadership in the world has gotten weaker under Trump.

After Trump’s first 100 days, 56 percent of voters said he’d accomplished anywhere from “not much” to “little or nothing” as president; that’s risen to 65 percent. A similar number say Trump lacks the personality and temperament to serve effectively.

Republican Support

Even so, the poll found that the president would run in a dead heat with Democrat Hillary Clinton among 2016 voters in a hypothetical rematch, with 91 percent of Trump voters saying they’d support him again. Trump has a 79 percent approval rating among Republicans, down from 88 percent at the time of his election.

Some 61 percent of Americans say Democratic leaders -- hopeful of making gains in 2018 midterm elections -- are mainly criticizing Trump without having a platform of their own.

The survey was conducted Oct. 29-Nov. 1 by Langer Research Associates via landline and mobile phones, among a random sample of 1,005 adults. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 points."

Negotiators representing the 28-nation bloc and its member states will meet on Nov. 8 to overhaul the Emissions Trading System, the EU’s flagship climate-policy tool to reduce greenhouse gases. Discussions have stalled over a new modernization fund, with some lawmakers pushing to restrict financing just to utilities that emit less than 450 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour, a move that would make aid unavailable to coal-fired power plants.

Coal-reliant Poland is fighting the measure, with Prime Minister Beata Szydlo threatening to intervene at the next meeting of EU leaders if the overhauls cut funding to the country’s existing plants. Western European companies including Siemens AG and Eni SpA have joined environmental lobbies supporting an emission limit for aid to align EU policy with more ambitious climate goals.

“There is a risk that the ETS modernization fund for eastern member states may unintentionally support considerable investments in carbon-intensive electricity production,” Ronald Busch, managing board member at Siemens, said in an interview. “Setting a CO2 limit would bring investments in line with Europe’s climate ambition.”

The challenge for the EU is to find an environmentally and economically sound compromise among 28 countries with differing energy sources and wealth levels. Europe, which wants to lead the global battle against climate change, toughened its carbon-reduction target to at least 40 percent by 2030 from 20 percent in 2020. The EU ETS covers almost half of the region’s emissions, imposing pollution limits on around 12,000 facilities owned by manufacturers and utilities.

The principle of the cap-and-trade system is that companies emitting less than their quota can sell their unused permits, getting a financial incentive to become cleaner. The overhaul aims to adjust the program to the 2030 climate goal and to bolster the price of allowances after they lost nearly 70 percent over the past nine years. Benchmark EU permits traded at 7.90 euros per metric ton on Friday compared with the 25-to-30 euro target lawmakers had in mind when they were designing rules for the 2013-2020 phase of the market.

The emission performance standard of 450 grams carbon-dioxide was the biggest sticking point at the previous round of talks between the representatives of EU governments and the European Parliament on Oct. 12. After 13 hours of talks, negotiators left the meeting around 3 a.m. without reaching a deal. Estonia, which leads the talks on behalf of EU member states, demanded the number be removed, offering instead a provision to ensure spending under the modernization fund is in line with the Paris Agreement goals. The team from the European Parliament didn’t want to give up on the 450 grams.

The Polish government and the Eastern European country’s energy companies including PGE SA have demanded an increase of the modernization fund and argued that they need time and money to shift from coal to greener energy sources without undermining the security of the power supply. An emissions performance standard would force utilities to build new natural gas plants, which they argue still produce greenhouse gases and would increase Warsaw’s dependence on gas from Russia.

“It seems that it will be difficult to reach an agreement in the Council of the EU,” Szydlo said in Brussels after an EU summit last month. “We’re still holding to hope that it will be possible. If not, I will propose that those disadvantageous proposals by the European Commission be discussed at an EU summit because they are very unfavorable for Poland and for a large group of countries.”

The modernization fund was set up to help 10 lower-income member states, with gross domestic product per capita below 60 percent of the EU average, modernize their energy infrastructure and reduce greenhouse gases. In the run-up to the Nov. 8 meeting, seven EU nations including France, Germany, Sweden and Denmark, suggested a compromise provision that would prevent using the fund to support “solid fossil fuels-based energy generation.”

“To the extent that this is made clear, we are open to alternative ways to formulate such appropriate safeguards,” the countries, which also include Luxembourg, Netherlands and the U.K., said in an informal document presented to Estonia and obtained by Bloomberg News.

Any compromise on the carbon-market overhaul will come in the form of a package that balances the need for bolstering the market, protecting the competitiveness of European companies and ensuring financing for modernization, EU lawmakers have said. In September, the negotiators provisionally agreed on the first element by approving strengthening of a special reserve that will alleviate oversupply of permits.

For Estonia, the holder of the rotating EU presidency until the end of this year, the reform is one of the most important issues on the table.

“EU ETS is the cornerstone of our climate policy and it needs a reform to ensure that the system functions well.

Ex-Goldman risk manager Robert Litterman has the perfect solution that will never work.,2017-11-03T09:01:21.873Z,bloomberg,There's One Unspeakable Fix That Would Help Pay for the GOP's Tax Cuts,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-11-03/there-s-one-unspeakable-fix-that-would-help-pay-for-the-gop-s-tax-cuts,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iVaVFW48j57g/v1/1200x960.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"The White House and Congress may need revenue to pay for their tax cuts. Ex-Goldman risk manager Robert Litterman has the perfect solution that will never work.

Paying for tax reform is easy—as long as the White House and Congress don’t mind fixing climate change at the same time.

That’s the counterintuitive pitch of Robert Litterman, a financial economist who became famous on Wall Street in the 1990s for co-inventing a method (PDF) for allocating assets within a portfolio. He went on to become Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s top risk manager and then led its quantitative asset management investments until he left in early 2010. Today, he’s the chairman of the Risk Committee at Kepos Capital.

A funny thing happened when Litterman decided, around the time he left Goldman, to apply basic tenets of Wall Street risk management to climate change: He came to the conclusion that taxes on greenhouse gas pollution should be higher than anything proposed or enacted almost anywhere in the world, and he decided to make it his mission to push for that unlikeliest of outcomes in the U.S.

As Washington scrutinizes House Republicans' new tax package, Litterman, 65, and his allies on both the left and right are pushing for a new carbon policy. It could be what Washington calls a “pay-for,” a way to offset tax cuts by increasing government revenue in other ways. A $25 per ton carbon tax would go a long way—almost $1 trillion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office—toward balancing out the cost of reforms. Congress has approved a 2018 budget resolution that allows room for enough tax reform to increase the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, not accounting for growth sparked by the changes.

Yet, to call a carbon tax dead on arrival would be an insult to dead things, since they have spent at least some time being alive. The new congressional tax proposals mention nothing of the sort. The ideas in the Republican plan include cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, shedding the complexity of deductions and repealing of the Alternative Minimum Tax, which snares increasing numbers of Americans into paying higher rates.

These issues don’t move Litterman the same way a carbon tax does. The most consequential thing tax reform can do, he believes, is to bring energy prices in line with the damage fossil fuel pollution is doing—and is projected to do—to general conditions for life and business worldwide.

“If you price things appropriately, people will make the right decisions,” Litterman said. “They'll do the right thing.”

When a risk manager gets interested in climate change, he notices things that others might not. Litterman became incredulous about a decade ago when a friend explained to him that economists who work on the issue often fought over how to estimate the economic damage, in dollars, from a ton of carbon dioxide.

It's a an arcane problem, both difficult to compute and pivotal to get right. Think of the price of a ton of carbon dioxide as the fulcrum on which economics and pollution-cutting goals must balance. Climate economists commonly refer to the “social cost of carbon” as the most important number no one's ever heard of. If it’s too low, prices won’t reflect the actual damage climate change is expected to inflict in the long-term and is already doing today. If it’s too high, prices might harm economic growth without any environmental benefit.

How to Hit the Brakes on Climate Change

Despite years of debate, governments and companies have yet to converge on a single price tag for what a ton of pollution costs. Levies currently enshrined in law, based on research from inside and outside government, range from $3 a ton in Mexico to $130 a ton in Sweden. U.S. resource economists commonly price a ton of carbon from $30 to $40, as did the Obama administration. Using different starting assumptions, President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency last month put forward a cost of roughly $1 to $5 as part of its effort to repeal (PDF) Obama’s Clean Power Plan.

Close to 1,400 companies (PDF) also track—or are planning to track—what a carbon-tax policy would cost them so their financial officers aren't overwhelmed if, or when, a carbon tax materializes. Political and economic concerns play at least as important a role as the economists' models.

After conducting his own assessment, Litterman concluded that the economists were doing it wrong. They were under-playing worst-case scenarios, which are a critical input for professional risk assessment in any field. The mistakes governments are making today in underpricing climate risk is akin to those of the financial sector in the mid-2000s, shortly before bad mortgages nearly destroyed the financial planet.

Uncertainty about worst-case scenarios, coupled with the risk-aversion people demonstrate in financial markets, add up for Litterman to an immediate, high CO2 price, which might decline as the energy system cleans itself up.

“It’s when I realized it was an asset-pricing problem,” Litterman said. “The approach that the economists have taken did not take in modern asset pricing.”

Climate change is an unusual asset-valuation problem, one defined by an absence—space in the atmosphere to hold emitted carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. But the basics of analysis still apply.

First is risk per se, the probability that any particular bad thing may come to pass. Risks can be quantified based on historical data, and measures can be taken to mitigate against them. Financial economists know enough about risk to calculate its effect on prices. The risk of a stock or portfolio is a function of its past performance relative to the market. There are many different kinds of quantitative risk, from fire-insurance underwriting to medical-error reduction in hospitals.

It just doesn’t always show up in how bills become laws.

Then there is uncertainty: the expectation that unexpected things will happen. When decision-makers don’t know how much wiggle room they have on a problem, the cautious thing to do is avert the worst-case scenario through higher prices. That's why uncertainty demands a very high premium, Litterman said: It’s why pollution is really expensive now, though not reflected in market prices, and why its price might taper as emissions do.

People traditionally demand very high returns to take on systemic risks with high uncertainty, said Jerry Taylor, president of the libertarian Niskanen Center, whose thinking on climate change was significantly influenced by Litterman. The long-term difference between returns in equities and bonds can be understood as a strong signal of risk aversion—investors typically are willing to pay more, or to see less of a return, from safer investments.

“If we were only concerned with the most likely outcome in the market"" for equities, Taylor said, “there’d be no need for Goldman Sachs. We know what the most likely outcome in the market is in any given year, right? Equities are going to return better than anything else, so you just toss your money in an index fund and you walk away.”

Uncertainty about the scale of bad news is exacerbated by uncertainty about its timing. When a potential problem looms, nobody has any idea when the clock has stopped. With climate change, it’s even more difficult to say with precision how much time there is to wind down fossil fuel pollution. “If we wait until your mind is changed about the seriousness of this problem, it’s too late,” Taylor said. “By that point, we can not effectively act.”

As a financial economist and risk manager, Litterman expects the world to make rational sense and is troubled when it doesn't. Incentives drive resource use. Resource use has destructive side effects, which are there whether prices capture them or not. Litterman refers casually to free atmospheric dumping of carbon dioxide as “a bug in the tax code.”

Fix the tax code, he argues, and we can save the planet.

The main problem with Litterman’s logically sound, upbeat analysis is the real world. A carbon tax would be difficult to pass in any political climate. Even if there were a congressional appetite for such a tax, it would be difficult to combine Wall Street risk- and uncertainty-pricing logic with federal cost-benefit analyses. There’s a methodological divide over how to define the problem.

He's still trying. Recent work by Litterman, Harvard’s Gernot Wagner, and Kent Daniel of Columbia takes a more modern analytical approach to calculating the social cost of carbon. Methods developed in the late 1980s for projecting the course of prices over time bring more nuance than cruder, decades-old macroeconomic equations that power conventional carbon accounting.

If there are other former Ph.D. economist, investment bank risk managers-turned-quant investors traveling the country talking up carbon pricing, they’re not speaking loud enough. Few, if any, have the intellectual shrewdness and modest demeanor to match Litterman’s answer to this question: What is the strongest arguments opponents use against you in climate debates?

“There is no argument against it,” he said.

Yet little has happened.

For the last several years, Litterman has been betting that fossil fuel stocks are slowly on their way down. He developed an investment vehicle in conjunction with World Wildlife Fund (WWF), where he is a board member, that goes up when fossil energy companies’ stocks go down. He renews a version of the “stranded assets total return” swap every year for his own personal use, via Goldman.

The first year, 2014, the swap was long on the S&P 500 Index and short on coal and tar-sands stocks. Its composition has evolved to include oil exploration and production, as well as a more targeted list suggested in a June analysis by the U.K. research group Carbon Tracker Initiative, Principles for Responsible Investment, and others.

Litterman gets alerts on his phone as to how the swap is doing: intraday updates on a generation-long bet. It was up in early 2016, after 196 nations clinched the Paris Agreement. He showed his data that February to fellow WWF board members, who were struck by the hard information to back soft assessments about the effects of the pact. The rest of 2016 was all downhill, bottoming out several weeks after the U.S. elections. Through the spring, it rocketed up in value, growing 18 percent from January through May.

The swap rose in value 3.8 percent the week of Trump’s June 1 announcement that the U.S. would quit the Paris Agreement, amid general market yawning. ​It’s been up this year, although not dramatically.

“We’re going to recognize this for what it is, which is an extremely dangerous risk-management failure,” Litterman said. “That means we’re going to have to price emissions at a high level—globally—very quickly, or much more quickly than people expect.”

Experts can disagree on how high a high global price should be, or if there should be one. No one can disagree that, whatever the merits of Litterman's climate risk-assessment model, governments are nonetheless pursuing something else."
Danielle Bochove,"Renewed demand for cobalt, the metal, is breathing new life into Cobalt, the town.",2017-10-31T09:00:16.441Z,bloomberg,The Canadian Ghost Town That Tesla Is Bringing Back to Life,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-10-31/the-canadian-ghost-town-that-tesla-is-bringing-back-to-life,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iJeDLSHLdf1A/v1/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Ironically, Cobalt, Ontario—population 1,100—was built on silver.

Remnants of a boom that transformed the town more than a century ago are everywhere. A mine headframe still protrudes from the roof of the bookstore, which was previously a grocery. The butcher used to toss unwanted bones down an abandoned 350-foot shaft in the middle of the shop floor and keep meat cool in its lowered mine cage.

While the last silver mines closed almost 30 years ago, a global push for the village’s namesake metal is promising to breathe new life into the sleepy town 500 kilometers (300 miles) north of Toronto. The whitish element (which “blooms” pink when exposed to air) was initially ignored by the area’s prospectors and later mined mainly as a by-product of silver. Now, global demand for cobalt, a component in batteries used to power electric cars for automakers from Tesla Inc. to Volkswagen AG, is changing the game.

Call it a cobalt rush in Cobalt.

“This area’s seen more airborne surveys in the last year than in the last hundred,” said Gino Chitaroni, a local prospector and geologist. “Two years ago, if you had a cobalt property you couldn’t give it away. All of a sudden, within six months, everything changed.”

Cobalt, both the town and the metal, are attracting renewed attention as a buffer to rising political risks in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which accounted for more than half the world’s 123,000-ton production in 2016, according to Natural Resources Canada. China and Canada were a distant second and third, each contributing roughly 6 percent of supply, followed by Russia and Australia. But as concerns grow about country risk in the DRC, even as demand swells, those smaller players stand to benefit.

“Anybody who has cobalt outside the DRC is in a better situation because carmakers are very worried about their supply chains,” said Roger Bell, director of mining research at Hannam & Parters in London. Bell believes the amount of cobalt being used in electric cars could easily double in the next eight to 15 years. “Even in the most conservative assumptions, you’re looking at maybe a 20 percent gap between supply and demand for cobalt by 2025.”

Stock investors betting on cobalt are already benefiting. First Cobalt Corp., a Canadian miner exploring in the Cobalt area, has soared 90 percent this year. Cobalt 27 Capital Corp., another miner based in British Columbia, has jumped almost 600 percent. Neither company has any revenue.

The heightened interest in the metal is evident in Cobalt. Earlier this month, two dozen investors, bankers and hedge fund managers from as far away as Shanghai boarded a chartered plane and then a bus from Toronto through the autumnal splendor of Ontario’s boreal forest. Their host was First Cobalt, a Vancouver-based miner that recently abandoned the Congo in order to secure more land around Cobalt’s old mining camp.

“We’ve got some of the biggest resource companies in the world interested,” said Trent Mell, First Cobalt’s chief executive officer, fresh from eight weeks of travel through the U.S., Europe, Australia and Asia pitching his company to investors.

Given that early prospectors more or less tripped over the abundant silver deposits, the area is largely a blank slate when it comes to proper exploration, he said. Although cobalt was later extracted from the area, notably by Toronto-based Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. until the late 1980s, Mell believes much remains undiscovered, particularly at the site of failed silver mines. Both metals are even part of Agnico’s name, which comes from the periodic table symbols for silver (Ag), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co).

Yet it was silver that first drew prospectors to Cobalt 115 years ago. Contractors looking for lumber to expand the Canadian railroad discovered visible silver in the loose rock. Within two years, 600 prospecting licenses had been issued and by 1907, that had swelled to almost 10,000, according to records housed in the Cobalt Mining Museum. The newly born town was simultaneously cosmopolitan and raucous: while mine owners enjoyed an opera house and a gentlemen’s club, their employees let off steam at “blind pigs,” illegal watering holes named for the unfortunate animals on which bootlegged alcohol was tested.

Fortunes were made with little mining expertise because rich silver deposits lay so close to surface. In 1911 alone, more than 31.5 million ounces of silver were pulled out of the “camp,” roughly one-eighth of the world’s production, according to a book on the area written by historian Doug Baldwin. Speaking to Toronto’s Empire Club in 1909, the book recounts, Reverend Cannon Tucker told of a widely traveled American who, asked where Toronto was, replied: “Oh yes, that is the place where you change trains for Cobalt.”

Today, the remains of those heady days are still visible in the crumbled foundations, capped mine shafts and piles of waste rock scattered in back yards throughout the town. More than 420 million ounces of silver came out of the Cobalt camp during its first 60 years and the town is built on a “honeycomb” of old mining tunnels and trenches, according to its mayor, Tina Sartoretto.

“The main road coming into town caved in a few years ago,” she said during a driving tour of the town. Inhabitants can’t drink the water in nearby Cobalt Lake, and a shaft in the disused public school was only recently capped. “The town is built on old mining residue.”

Sartoretto is hoping the renewed demand for cobalt will inject some economic life into her impoverished town. With no industrial base to speak of, the town struggles to survive on legacy endowments from past silver and cobalt miners Agnico and Teck Resources Ltd.

Sartoretto’s hope is that future mining will include plans for sustainable economic development tied to the metal. “If you were producing cobalt here, it would be nice if you could produce batteries here,” she said.

Depending on how First Cobalt’s exploration unfolds, the landscape in and around the town could be altered yet again. The company’s vision is for at least one open pit mine over a kilometer wide, said Frank Santaguida, First Cobalt’s vice president of exploration.

“Someday, that hill will likely be an open pit,” Chitaroni predicted, pointing to the far side of Cobalt Lake, where previously mined rock looms over a baseball diamond. The land currently belongs to Agnico, which hasn’t mined the area since 1989. “I wish they’d get proactive and drill off the damn thing.”

The Toronto-based company, which is focused on gold, does remediation in the area and has no plans for exploration, said Dale Coffin, an Agnico spokesman.

Where Agnico doesn’t have claims, interest is building. Prospectors regularly come into the bookstore, hoping to discover old mine maps and surveys. Chitaroni is always on hand to tick off the advantages of Cobalt compared with more remote mining jurisdictions, including access to power, hydro and expertise.

“We call it Tim Hortons’s exploration,” he said, referring to the convenience of the ubiquitous Canadian doughnut-and-coffee chain, which has a store near Cobalt. “If you’ve got a breakdown, in half an hour, I’ve got parts. Try doing that in the Congo.”"
Tom Randall,"While consumers must wait until 2018 for a $35,000 electric car, efforts to fix bottlenecks are sapping resources elsewhere in Elon Musk’s empire.",2017-11-02T18:35:42.894Z,bloomberg,Model 3 ‘Hell’ Is Burning Tesla’s Other Projects,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-02/model-3-hell-is-burning-tesla-s-other-projects,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i3hgOXDQNXmw/v0/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"There will be no $35,000 Teslas in 2017.

The electric carmaker updated its website for customer reservations on Wednesday, including a table that shows the base Model 3 won’t be available until some time next year. That follows a painful earnings call for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who described the company as being in the “eighth level of hell” (there are nine, in case you’re counting). The stock price fell 8.9 percent on Thursday, the most in more than 16 months.

People from key teams at Tesla are focused on fixing bottlenecks that have hobbled production, said Musk, who held his earnings call at the Nevada battery factory where he and co-founder J.B. Straubel are spending their days and nights. Despite earlier reports that it was the company’s California assembly plant that was gumming up the works, it turns out the famed Gigafactory is the heart of the problem. The reallocation of resources to fix the difficulties may be contributing to delays for Autopilot, the Solar Roof, the Tesla Semi, and the Tesla Network.

“Tesla’s cash burn is astounding, and time is ticking,” said Salim Morsy, an electric-car analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “They have some pretty urgent things to deal with, and we just don’t have any visibility right now.”

Here are five key products still waiting to catch an elevator out of the inferno:

1. The Model 3

Tesla Model 3 Source: Tesla

The “$35,000 electric car” has been Tesla’s top goal and marketing calling card for years. It’s an important price point, competing with entry level luxury gasoline-powered cars like the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes C Class. When you include a $7,500 U.S. tax credit, the price is cheaper than the average new U.S. car and more in line with a well-optioned Toyota Camry.

But on Wednesday’s call with analysts, Tesla pushed back its timelines for the Model 3 by three months. A production rate of 5,000 a week won’t be achieved until the end of March, rather than the end of next month. The $35,000 base model has been pushed back from November 2017 to sometime in 2018. (Tesla still plans to start selling a $49,000 long-range version with options to the public in time for Christmas.)

Perhaps the biggest warning flag: Musk would no longer give a timeline on when Tesla would reach a production rate of 10,000 a week. Last quarter he was unequivocal on that point: “What people should absolutely have zero concern about—and I mean zero—is that Tesla will achieve a 10,000 unit production week by the end of next year.”

2. The Solar Roof

A year ago this week, Tesla unveiled its remarkable solar shingles with much fanfare in Hollywood on an old set of “Desperate Housewives.” It began taking deposits in May. There’s still little indication of when the product might roll out. Tesla said things will move slowly in the coming quarter while it gets its new factory in Buffalo, New York, up and running. Then, the company said, the product will ramp up “in 2018.” That’s a wide window for customers trying to plan a roofing project.

Perhaps a better indication of where things stand is this: Tesla’s website currently shows job postings for 24 “ lead roofer” positions—all in California. Each position, according to the descriptions, would be second-in-command of a small roofing team. Meanwhile, the amount of standard solar installations being done have dropped 42 percent compared with the same quarter last year, just before Tesla bought SolarCity.

3. Autopilot

A year after Tesla started charging $8,000 for a feature called Full Self Driving, there’s still no sign of a rollout of such features, and Musk hinted that a more powerful supercomputer may be needed to achieve its goal. On Wednesday, he said the current hardware can reach “approximately human-level autonomy.”

Musk concedes that the system will probably need to be significantly safer than the average human driver in order to achieve regulatory approval, so a hardware upgrade may be necessary. “We’ll have more to say on the hardware front soon, we’re just not ready to say anything now,” said Musk. As a consolation, anyone who has already paid for the option will get a free computer swap.

Elon Musk Was Wrong About Self-Driving Teslas

Tesla said new features will be coming for its less-ambitious $5,000 Enhanced Autopilot package in the next few months. Musk said the other hardware for autonomous driving—8 cameras, a radar and 12 ultrasonic sensors—will be sufficient. Other companies pursuing autonomous driving are also including expensive lidar kits. Musk was undeterred: “We are certain that our hardware strategy is better than any other option, by a lot.”

4. Tesla Semi

Tesla was set to unveil its first all-electric long-range semi truck back in September. Then it was moved to October. Then it was pushed until Nov. 16 , explicitly so that resources could be diverted to deal with Model 3 problems.

Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks & increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 6, 2017 Tesla reiterated the same unveiling date by press release Wednesday. However, it’s notable that such an integral and imminent product for Tesla didn’t even come up on the analyst call.

5. The Tesla Network

Tesla is working on a system that will allow owners to rent out their cars using what they’ve dubbed the Tesla Network. Once fully autonomous driving is achieved, the idea is that fleets of privately owned Teslas will function like a driverless Uber or Lyft, picking up and delivering passengers for a fee that will be shared between Tesla and the individual car owners.

In the shorter-term, the Tesla Network could function more like Zipcar. An owner could switch a setting online and open their car for someone to rent. The Model 3 uses key cards and Tesla’s smartphone app instead of a key, so in theory anyone could be granted access through an automated system.

The Tesla Network, which accounts for billions of dollars in long-term revenue in many analyst models, is supposed to be unveiled this year. With all of the bigger delays drawing the attention, it didn’t even get a mention on Wednesday."

Tetsu, the TriBeCa robata grill with an elite downstairs tasting menu from one of the world’s most acclaimed sushi chefs, will officially open Nov. 14.

There are few restaurateurs more associated with fish than Masa Takayama. At his eponymous Time Warner Center restaurant, the cherubic chef has redefined the experience of eating raw seafood. And what that privilege can cost: A meal at Masa currently rings in at $595, excluding beverages and tax.

(In more recent Masa fish news, the FDA cited the restaurant for using fish that was improperly stored. Masa responded: “The fish mentioned in the FDA letter is very specialized and requires specific handling. We have been working closely with the FDA to follow the procedures they are requesting both here in New York and with our vendors in Japan.”)

At Tetsu, Takayama will turn his attention to a different protein: meat. On the main floor of the bi-level space on Leonard Street, he’ll serve robata grilled skewers, soups, and stews; downstairs, at the luxe Basement, he’ll offer a reservations-only omakase menu that highlights cuts butchered from whole animals.

Tetsu has been on the verge of opening for years; word of the project first came out in 2012. The chef says he got the idea soon after he came to New York in 2004 to open Masa. “Sundays are my only day off, and when I first moved to New York I was always looking for a place where I could enjoy a cold beer or martini and eat some delicious, flavorful food to go with it. I could never find a restaurant that satisfied exactly what I was looking for, so I decided to just build it.” He adds: “I wanted Tetsu to evoke the experience of dining around the robata [a charcoal grill surrounded by diners], to feel like you’re in my home.”

In the interim, Takayama says the delays were ones that any restaurant going into an 1865 landmarked New York building would have faced. The famously perfectionist chef has also created his own roadblocks: Almost every detail of the restaurant, from the height of the bar and the finish of its cast-iron top to the weight of the serving platters has been obsessed over, and tweaked, by Takayama.

The result is a space that feels vintage TriBeCa, with 14-foot ceilings, restored Corinthian columns, and plenty of iron work. (Tetsu translates as “iron.”) The main floor is dominated by a 36-foot counter fashioned from a single Japanese Bubinga tree, with a mezzanine level decorated with zig-zagging cables.

Fried Chicken and Nigiri Sushi

The idea of a chef whose specialty is the most elite, expensive seafood in the world turning his attention to such dishes as fried chicken and peppercorn spare ribs is compelling. Tetsu’s menu includes sections with names such as “Sizzling,” “Fried,” and the namesake “Robata Grill.” Takayama custom-designed the grill itself, which can be raised or lowered to accommodate different ingredients and various levels of char.

On the menu: A long list of skewered items, costing from $4 to $9, includes juicy pork sausage flavored with three kinds of chile; sweet beef; soy-glazed chicken; coco shrimp; baby potato; and “misoburi” yellowtail. Among the stews are meaty chunks of pork neck with black bean; grilled vegetable and miso; and tender slices of beef tripe in a tangy tomatillo broth ( $8 to $14). Takayama is frying everything from quail to soft shell shrimp with garlic, as well as the aforementioned chicken, available as whole or half ($22 or $14).

Takayama is not ignoring the kind of fish he’s famous for. There’s a selection of nigiri sushi, and it’s cheaper than comparable options at his uptown Bar Masa. (The goal at the downtown restaurant is to make food that’s approachable in terms of prices and selection, he says.) A la carte sushi includes uni ($8); uni with quail egg ($12); grilled ocean eel ($7); striped jack ($6); hamachi ($7); and grilled maitake mushrooms ($5). You could gorge on 100 pieces of kanpachi ($6) for the price of a meal at Masa.

Unconventional Omakase

If the plan for the main floor is to be highly accessible, the plan for the downstairs, called Basement, is to create extreme dinner parties. The reservations-only space has 34 seats situated between a long counter facing the kitchen and individual tables crafted from metal and designed by the chef. The omakase menu will be priced at $295 and will start around Dec. 1. (Masa considered a higher price, one that crept closer to Masa’s, then discarded the idea.) The menu will range from 10-12 courses. “There will be a generous use of caviar and truffles, my two favorite things to eat—only the top, best ingredients,” promises Takayama. His focus will be on specially prepared whole fish and birds and large meat cuts, including fatty, marbled Ohmi beef, known as the world’s top Waygu. “Dishes will be prepared in different ways, depending on my mood. Basement is more about a concept and vision than a place. It’s where I can express my cooking philosophy, presenting dishes that capture ingredients as they are. Masa is all about sushi and a traditional omakase experience. Basement will be more rock ‘n’ roll, with emphasis on meat, whole fish, and birds prepared using different techniques.”

One unconventional way that Takayama has coped with his monumental restaurant delay is to sketch out every detail of the restaurant, step by step. “I am always sketching everything. I use rolls of paper towels and sketch every idea I have, illustrating what ingredients should be in the dish, what plate to use, and how it should be presented. I don’t like to communicate my ideas on email—I want to talk to my chefs in person, and most often I just hand them my sketches so they know exactly what I want.”

The delay has also given Takayama time to find a favorite place in the joint. “The far seat at the end of the food bar is my favorite. Every day I’m at Tetsu, I like to spread out all my drawings and observe my team working all around me. I don’t say much, but I get to see how people work and the care they take in my restaurant.”"

The Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel also reported late Saturday that 11 princes and dozens of former ministers were detained in a new anti-corruption probe headed by the kingdom’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was also named to oversee the new committee.

(Update: Also arrested was Trump Critic and billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a prominent investor in US companies including Twitter and Citigroup, the New York Times reported.)

Al-Arabiya reported that the committee is looking into devastating and deadly floods that overwhelmed parts of the city of Jiddah in 2009 and is investigating the Saudi government’s response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus that has killed several hundred people in the past few years.

Meanwhile, the kingdom’s top council of clerics issued a statement saying it is an Islamic duty to fight corruption— essentially giving religious backing to the high-level arrests being reported.

The government said the anti-corruption committee has the right to issue arrest warrants, impose travel restrictions and freeze bank accounts. It can also trace funds, prevent the transfer of funds or the liquidation of assets and take other precautionary measures until cases are referred to the judiciary.

The royal order said the committee was established “due to the propensity of some people for abuse, putting their personal interest above public interest, and stealing public funds.”

Saudi nationals have long complained of rampant corruption in government and of public funds being squandered or misused by people in power.

The 32-year-old crown prince has been seeking to attract greater international investments and improve the country’s reputation as a place to do business. It’s part of a larger effort to diversify the economy away from dependence on oil revenue.

The king ousted one of the country’s highest-level royals from power, removing Prince Miteb bin Abdullah as head of the National Guard. He was replaced by Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin, who had held a senior post with the guard.

Prince Miteb’s father was the late King Abdullah, who also had led the National Guard and had transformed it into a powerful and prestigious force tasked with protecting the ruling Al Saud family, as well as important holy sites in Mecca and Medina, and oil and gas sites.

Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne. His ouster as head of the National Guard essentially sidelines one of the most formidable rivals to the current crown prince, who has amassed enormous power in less than three years since his father, King Salman, ascended to the throne.

It comes just three months after Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was ousted from the line of succession and from his post as interior minister, overseeing internal security.

With the two princes now sidelined, control of the kingdom’s security apparatus is now largely centralized under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is also defense minister.

The monarch also replaced Minister of Economy and Planning Adel Fakeih with his deputy, Mohammad al-Tuwaijri.

Admiral Abdullah Al-Sultan was also sacked as commander of Saudi Naval Forces and replaced by Admiral Fahd bin Abdullah Al-Ghifaili.

The president did not name specific leaders in Asia, such as North Korea, but alluded to their dim future.

“History has proven over and over that the road of the tyrant is a steady march towards poverty, suffering, and servitude,” Trump said. “But the path of strong nations and free peoples, certain of their values and confident in their futures, is a proven path to prosperity and peace.”

Trump praised the United States military, promising to give them the best equipment and resources to do their jobs.

“We dominate the sky, we dominate the sea, we dominate the land and space,” he said.

Trump promoted the success of the United States under his leadership, citing strong economic numbers since his election. He also commented on the ongoing fight against Islamic State terrorists.

“We’ve dealt ISIS one brutal defeat after another, and it’s about time,” he said.

Lieutenant General Jerry P. Martinez, the commander of the U.S. forces in Japan, presented Trump with a new flight jacket, which he exchanged for his suit coat.

“I like this better,” he said to the cheering audience.

The president visited the base as part of his 10-day trip to Asia.

During his flight aboard Air Force One, one reporter asked what his message was to the North Korean people.

“I think they’re great people. They’re industrious. They’re warm, much warmer than the world really knows or understands,” Trump said. “They’re great people. And I hope it all works out for everybody.”"

Bannon says.

During a speech to American families of illegal alien crime victims, organized as The Remembrance Project, Bannon slammed efforts by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to slip an amnesty for nearly 800,000 illegal aliens covered by the Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program into an end-of-the-year spending bill.

Bannon said sarcastically:

But Mitch McConnell is on TV today and Paul Ryan was talking about it yesterday, they were over at the White House before the President left, I think it was Thursday, Senator Cotton and Perdue and some of the other senators are really focused on doing something on legal immigration. They were over there, and guess what they’re talking about: DACA. Excuse me, they’re talking about amnesty. They’re talking about amnesty and how they slip it into a spending bill and then Mitch McConnell’s on MSNBC today, a real platform for the Right. When’s he going to come on Breitbart?

“He’s on MSNBC and he’s saying ‘Oh yeah, we’re just going to attach DACA amnesty, you know the Democrats want it, the Republican establishment you know, we don’t have a problem with that,'” Bannon said. “Okay, well he may not have a problem with it, but I think ya’ll have a problem with it.”

Bannon said of the Republican establishment:

It’s time they finally understood something. If there is amnesty, they’re going to get blown out. We have fought this for years and years and years and years. The American people, and particularly folks in the Republican Party and the conservative movement, have said in no uncertain terms, there will be no amnesty and there will be no path to citizenship.

Bannon’s statement on McConnell referred to an interview today in which the Senate Majority Leader caved to a DACA amnesty by saying it “ought to be” attached to other immigration reforms, Breitbart News reported.

As Breitbart News reported, if Republicans and Democrats signed off on an amnesty plan for DACA illegal aliens, it could trigger a chain migration to the U.S. whereby 9.9 million to 19 million foreign nationals would enter the country over the next several decades.

Since DACA’s inception, more than 2,100 DACA recipients saw their protected status revoked for being involved in gang activity or suspected/convicted of a felony. Due to a loophole in the DACA program, more than 39,000 illegal aliens have been able to obtain Green Cards, and more than 1,000 have been naturalized."

Tancredo, a leading figure in the battle against illegal immigration since his election to Congress in the late 1990s, spoke with Breitbart News shortly after giving his own address, held in honor of Americans killed by illegal alien crime and the “angel families” of the bereaved. “Because he is attacked as much as he is, there is no better indicator of how powerful he is and how afraid they are of him,” Tancredo said of Bannon, to whom, in his speech, he referred as his “boss.”

Addressing the angel families and other attendees at the Willard Hotel, Tancredo related his decades-long struggle against the Republican establishment to bring the illegal immigration issue to the political fore. He described an eye-opening early experience shortly after his 1998 election, when over 200 of his fellow congressional Republicans walked out of a GOP conference meeting rather than watch his video on the ongoing flood of illegal aliens in Arizona.

Later, Tancredo turned his attention to his just-announced 2018 campaign for the governorship of Colorado, an office he has run for twice before. Seven years ago, in a landmark election for the anti-illegal immigration movement, Tancredo won 24 Colorado counties on a Constitution Party platform, but was kept out of the governor’s office in part because the Republican Party establishment enlisted national donors and resources against him. Tancredo was prevented from carrying the banner of the party he served in Congress into the general election because of his hardline stance on immigration. The GOP eventually ran a spoiler candidate who received only 11 percent of the vote and ensured a Democratic victory.

Given the pro-sovereignty wave that has swept the country in the age of Trump, Tancredo was confident of the chances for a populist-nationalist like him in 2018. “I am presently ahead of every single one of my Republican contenders in the primary for governor, and I am ahead by at least fifteen points,” he told Breitbart News, citing private polling. “But, more interesting to me, I am tied with the potential Democrat who’s going to run for governor, and that came out two weeks before I ever entered the race. So things look good.”"

The group, founded by Revolutionary Communist Party chairman Bob Avakian, took out a full-page ad in the New York Times to promote the rally, and has enjoyed free press in the national media in the past few days.

Despite the press attention, turnout was low at many of Refuse Fascism’s rallies, which were scheduled to take place in 20 U.S. cities. The exception appears to have been L.A, where local news reported that close to 2,000 protesters gathered.

There were no reports of violent incidents, although a woman accused of deliberately splashing her drink on a Trump supporter was reportedly arrested at the Refuse Fascism march in New York City.

The Chicago protest later grew to a small crowd.

Boston saw an even smaller crowd of protesters.

In the Antifa stronghold of Seattle, local observers estimate an attendance of about 50 during the afternoon. Many protest signs can be seen lying on the ground, untouched and unused.

One protester in Seattle turned up with a Soviet flag. I can only assume that the New York Times, the Washington Post and CNN, all of which hate murderous totalitarian ideologies, will give it the same kind of coverage they devoted to the swastika at Charlottesville. That’s how it works, right?

There was also a man with an American flag, which is not totalitarian at all. Unless you believe the left.

There was also a man with neither an American flag nor a Soviet flag, but a trombone. Tooooot.

Overall, there has been no sign of an “Antifa apocalypse.” Protesters only numbered in hundreds in leftist hotbeds like New York City and Philadelphia, despite substantial advertising and attention in the national media. Only in L.A did protesters’ numbers reach into the thousands, according to local reports. In many other locations targeted by Refuse Fascism, protesters could only muster a few dozen supporters.

The Good Wife star said the alleged Seagal encounter began with a female casting director asking her to go to Seagal’s hotel room at 10:00 pm to rehearse a scene with another actress.

“When I was 23, a casting director, a woman, said, ‘Steven Seagal wants to go over the scene with you in his hotel room at 10 o’clock at night.’ I got to the hotel at 10:40, and she wasn’t there. And he was. Alone,” Margulies said on Jenny Hutt’s Sirius XM show Just Jenny. “And he made sure that I saw his gun, which I had never seen a gun in real life. And I got out of there unscathed … I never was raped. And I never was harmed. And I don’t know how I got out of that hotel room … I sorta screamed my way out.”

Years later, while she was in her third season of the hit NBC medical drama ER, Margulies said she was asked to meet Harvey Weinstein in his hotel room ostensibly to discuss business. Margulies, still shaken by the alleged Seagal encounter, insisted that Weinstein’s female assistant accompany her to Weinstein’s room.

“She knocked on the door, and she was standing behind me,’ Margulies recalled. “And he opened the door in a bathrobe. I could see that there were candles lit in the room, and there was a dinner for two. And I saw him stare at her, daggers.”

“And he looked at me, furious,” she said of Weinstein, “And he slammed the door. And, of course, I didn’t get the part.”

“These women were leading me to the lion’s den,” Margulies said of the women involved in both alleged incidents.

Weinstein has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting more than 50 women during his decades-long career in Hollywood, and has also been accused of raping at least ten women. The disgraced movie mogul has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.

Kennedy assassination documents serves as a headscratcher before it catalyzes an ah-ha moment.

The files allege wild orgies, prostitutes, fathering a love-child, drinking benders, and other activities unbecoming of a minister. Conspiracy theorists hopeful for any tidbit validating their belief in an establishment out to destroy King and Kennedy likely see the material as one would expect them to see it. But given that the collection of much of the dirt came about because Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general, approved it surely puts a wrinkle in that narrative. The fact that his brother served as president during some of this unintelligent intelligence gathering complicates it further.

advertisement

The pertinent question here, however, pertains not to the Kennedys empowering the FBI to perform as the National Enquirer of law enforcement. Here’s the real puzzle: Why did the federal government include these documents in the John F. Kennedy assassination materials?

The King information, as well as other documents relating to the New Left, the Black Panthers, and the antiwar movement, hits as a non sequitur, and quite literally so. That all followed John F. Kennedy’s assassination, not the reverse. The controversial memorandum on King that compiled information gathered earlier shows a March 12, 1968, date. So, what connection do memos, and events, in the late 1960s have with an event in the early part of the decade?

Really, nothing. But by including all this in the John F. Kennedy assassination files the agencies involved in gathering the salacious information protected themselves against public outrage. As time passed, King’s secrets — real and imagined — proved less embarrassing than the fact that people in the government obsessed over his secrets. The most effective way to hide the government’s secrets was to pretend that it all related to the events in Dallas. This guaranteed the prying eyes of the public would not see the prying eyes of public servants — at least until a fifty years after the fact. Sure, the stories contained in that raw memo gained attention in spite of the actual document collecting dust. But the government went to great lengths to make sure that the document stayed hidden.

Friday’s document dump also included materials at least tangentially connected to the assassination, such as on the Bay of Pigs invasion. An argument could be made that those documents belong with the other information on the Kennedy assassination hidden under lock-and-key and redacting markers. But that argument does not strike as a strong one. If one wanted to protect sensitive, albeit dated, material from Freedom of Information Act requests and such, linking it to the John F. Kennedy assassination seems as the most effective way to do that.

The documents do not really belong with the other documents — transcripts of Lee Harvey Oswald phoning Russians in Mexico City, correspondence between Oswald and American Communist Party leaders, details of the investigation of various extremist leaders in the days following the assassination, etc. — that directly pertain to the assassination. To make sense of their inclusion one must understand why it made sense to do so to the people including them."

Marlow asked how Reagan came to be seen as a libertarian icon, “basically the type of guy that just wants to cut taxes on the nine smartest people in the country so that they can save us from ourselves with the lack of government,” when in truth he “fought for the dignity of working people and had a huge appeal to blue-collar Americans.”

advertisement

“Ronald Reagan talked a lot about freedom. What happened, I think, was that libertarian Koch sort of people, as you put it, latched onto this guy who interpreted them for the masses in their own light,” Olsen replied.

“We tend to forget that one of the Koch brothers ran against Ronald Reagan in 1980 because David Koch was a libertarian. Ronald Reagan wasn’t,” he pointed out. “Because Ronald Reagan was so staunchly in favor of freedom, they have interpreted him in a way that took out all the nuance and all the detail. The fact is that Ronald Reagan was somebody who raised taxes to support working people in the dignified pursuit of their own lives.”

Olsen recalled his own history with the Republican Party beginning with volunteer work when he was just twelve years old. “I was so diehard I went in on the day that Nixon resigned. I worked my way through the party, was a candidate at one point, and I got into Reagan because that was what you breathed in California in the 1970s,” he said.

“But after 2008, I looked and I saw a Republican Party that was worse off than at any time in my adult lifetime,” he continued. “I thought, ‘Reagan turned it around. How did he do it?’ I started studying him, and that’s when I learned that everything I knew about Reagan was wrong, that Reagan turned it around precisely because he wasn’t the archetypal Ayn Rand libertarian that I had been told he was.”

“Ronald Reagan first and foremost was somebody who put people first,” Olsen said. “He loved the American people. His epitaph says it all. You’ll go to Thomas Jefferson’s grave and you’ll see ‘Author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights’ and ‘Creator of the University of Virginia.’ Well, Ronald Reagan’s says on his last words, is that he knows man is good, that right will eventually triumph, and there is purpose and worth to each and every human life. That is the heart of Reaganism.”

“He believed that freedom was important and essential to that, but he also believed that government support was essential to that. That’s why he supported Social Security, it’s why he supported federal aid to help the poor pay medical bills, and it’s why he always supported a social safety net – and immigration and trade restrictions, when doing that would help the American worker,” Olsen noted.

He was critical of modern politicians attempting to appropriate Reagan’s memory for their own purposes, including Senator Ted Cruz. “Nobody quotes Reagan more and understands him less,” Olsen said.

“Regan said that the Republican platform should be ‘no pale pastels, only bold colors.’ Then you read what he actually proposed in that same speech, and it had an energetic support for environmental protection, an energetic support for a real safety net, a very limited attempt to restrict federal spending, no discussion of entitlements. Ronald Reagan’s bold colors would be called pale pastels by Ted Cruz,” he charged.

“Reagan was so far ahead of the curve that people only turned around the curve decades after he had already laid it out,” Olsen said.

“The thing to remember about Reagan is that you know, Sylvester Stallone was an out-of-work actor who wrote his vehicle to stardom. He wrote ‘Rocky.’ Ronald Reagan is the political version of that,” he explained. “He wrote his own speeches all the way up until really the presidency, and then he still had a big hand in his speeches. He thought through his principles. He created all the words that made him governor and then president. He was somebody who created the working class Republican-libertarian alliance that was the Reagan coalition, and that Donald Trump is recreating today.”

Olsen said Reagan had no difficulty reconciling his famed “Eleventh Commandment” – “Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican” – with vigorous primary challenges, such as those seen in the 2018 election cycle.

“He criticized Gerald Ford, but he criticized his policies. He didn’t criticize his person. He didn’t make personal attacks,” he recalled. “That was what Reagan was really talking about, was that you don’t want to drag your opponents through the mud because after the primary you’re going to have more in common than you do with the Democrat. So don’t drag somebody’s character through the mud, but make clear that there are real principled differences between you, and let that be the method of decision for Republicans and people who want to participate in the Republican primary.”

“One thing also about Reagan is that he never, throughout his career, only limited his appeal to Republicans. When his career was on the line against Gerald Ford in March 1976, he goes on national TV as a candidate for the Republican primary and says, ‘I want Democrats and independents to listen too because you’re part of my coalition,’” Olsen said.

Olsen saw the Reagan and Trump coalitions as “mirror images of each other.”

“Ronald Reagan was the first blue-collar Republican. He was somebody that took places that were traditionally Democrat and turned them 40 percent on the margin – they voted for him by 20 points when they had voted for the Democrat by 20 points. It was exactly the blue-collar person without a college degree, the person who’s not a traditional Republican, who doesn’t like slash-and-burn economics and doesn’t think their boss is the second coming of Jesus,” he said.

“Ronald Reagan convinced that person that he was on their side, that he had the balance of freedom and support that American workers wanted, and they flocked to him. They stayed with him throughout his life. That’s what Donald Trump was able to do. He was the first person since Ronald Reagan to have that sort of effect on exactly that sort of person. That’s why he’s president,” Olsen contended.

Marlow asked if Olsen saw these similarities before the election and therefore knew Trump would defeat Hillary Clinton.

“Yeah, I did,” he replied. “I was always writing about that, particularly on National Review. Every two years I figure I need to go out and tell people what I think is going to happen, and I don’t paint in pastels, I paint in bold colors with clear predictions. I had the most accurate prediction in the country, beating Nate Silver and every other prognosticator.”

“The question was always going to be the reverse, which not will Donald Trump get this constituency – he had this one sewed up from the minute he walked down the elevator in Trump Tower. The question was whether he was going to be able to keep enough loyal Republicans in line, and that by Election Night it was clear he was going to do,” he said.

Olsen observed that some conservatives still have not reconciled themselves to the Trump presidency.

“They don’t want populism in their party,” he explained. “I think that they seize on the president’s personality to make a critique of policy that they would disagree with equally as much if you had somebody who never tweeted and was the politest man on Earth.”

“Those people are just wrong on policy,” he declared. “There’s a global economic slowdown that’s hurting low-skilled workers throughout the world. We need to address that, and it needs to be something that takes precedence over free-market ideology. Ronald Reagan would have done exactly the same thing, and he did exactly the same thing when he was president. Every time you see a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, you should thank Ronald Reagan, because that company stayed in business because he slapped tariffs on Japanese motorcycle imports. He was so proud of it he devoted a whole page of his autobiography to it.”

Olsen said one key to Regan’s reconciliation of conservatism with libertarianism is that “he always made the American person, not the deified entrepreneur, the focus of his appeal.”

“Anyone who listened to Ronald Reagan’s speeches knew that he cared about their lives as they were lived, not that they were important against some abstract theory,” he elaborated. “He had credibility on a personal level.”

“The second thing is, as he was talking against government, he always made clear what type of government he was against,” Olsen continued. “He was against a government that planned our lives. He was against a government that controlled our lives. He was against a government that tried to make us live according to unelected bureaucrats. And he always talked about he was for certain things like a good education, like a basic safety net, like helping people in need.”

“In fact, even when he endorsed Barry Goldwater, in the central part of his speech he said what he was for, and he was for telling senior citizens that no one in America should go without medical care because of a lack of funds. When he endorsed Barry Goldwater, he endorsed an expansion of government that wasn’t even in place in 1964. That was the sort of twin message that always let people know, ‘Hey, he’s against government but he’s also for me, and being for me is more important to him than being against government,’” Olsen said.

“Ronald Reagan believed that every person was capable of dignity and deserved respect and self-government,” he said. “He really believed that if you gave the information to the American people, they would make wise decisions. You look throughout the libertarian movement and they believe exactly the opposite. They believe that the average person is a taker, not a maker; that the average person is somebody who is basically a grifter; and the only reason they’re productive at all is because of the elite few, you know, the Randian super-mensches who come around and create these things that get all of these unruly people into line.”

“That’s the exact opposite worldview, and you can see it in libertarian-like policies where when you ask about, ‘oh, what’s the impact on real people, won’t that throw people out of jobs?’ they just don’t care about the answer,” he said.

Olsen charted the course of Reagan’s bold political evolution by noting he began as a Democrat, and “not just a garden-variety Democrat – this is a guy who was a partisan liberal Democrat who worshipped Franklin Roosevelt.” In fact, Reagan was passed over by the Los Angeles County Democrats for his first possible political run because he was seen as too far to the left.

“He loved the Democratic Party and Roosevelt because he loved the American people,” Olsen said of the young Reagan. “When he became convinced that the Democratic Party was more interested in perpetuating power than helping people, he switched sides. And what he did was, he took that sensibility that made him a Democrat, the love of people’s dignity, and grafted onto a conservative movement and a business-oriented Republican Party whose fatal defects were caring more about power, or more about money, or more about ideology than they cared about people. He turned it into a whole that we now know as conservatism.”

Olsen challenged the conventional view of Reagan as a “supply-sider,” noting that Reagan rejected the term consistently in his letters and books.

“He was talking about tax cuts and deregulation when supply-siders were in high school,” he said. “He was always doing it from what helped the average person. He never was focusing on ‘freeing the entrepreneur’ or making the businessperson’s bottom line the bottom line for him. The bottom line for him is what he said to National Review in 1964 in dissecting Barry Goldwater’s defeat. He said conservatism represents the forgotten American, the person who goes to work, pays his mortgage, bucks for a raise, and knows there’s no such thing as a free lunch. That’s his constituency, and that’s the constituency that a business-oriented Republican or a libertarian just doesn’t really care about.”

Looking back at the last few presidential contests, Olsen said Reagan would have loyally backed each Republican nominee but would have seen Mitt Romney as “too aloof from the average person.”

“I think that Romney’s comments about the ‘47 Percent’ are the sort of thing that Ronald Reagan would never have thought about,” he said. “There’s one point after the election where Romney is caught on tape talking about, he loses because Obama promises free stuff. Ronald Reagan was in politics for 30 years, and he never once uttered a phrase or sentiment like that. It’s just not the way he thought.”

“John McCain and he were actually close,” he continued, moving back to Romney’s predecessor as Republican presidential nominee. “He admired McCain’s bravery. He admired McCain’s service to the country. McCain gets his start in Congress in part because of his closeness to Reagan. But I don’t think he would have supported a lot of John McCain’s domestic policy initiatives.”

“I think he would have thought privately that John McCain’s foreign policy, by the time of 2008, was much more aggressive,” he added. “Reagan is somebody who believed in having a strong military, but not in using it a whole lot – just in being there to use in case we needed it, rather than using it at every drop of a hat. So they were personally close, he admired McCain, but I think he would have disagreed with McCain’s policies from a different perspective in 2008.”

“Reagan always believed in peace through strength, but he did it against the backdrop of a communist power that sought and was acting towards world domination,” Olsen said, elaborating on Reagan’s foreign policy difference with today’s hawkish Republicans. “Would Ronald Reagan have seen Islamic terrorism as something that demanded putting American troops in the way of every bullet? Ronald Reagan didn’t do that when the communists were our threat. I don’t think he would have done it when Islamofascism was our threat.”

“He would have been for a strong military, but a prudent use of it,” Olsen asserted. “And he always built up allies and encouraged allies to take the fight. That’s what Contra and the Afghan mujahadeen were about, which was funding people who had enough of a stake in the conflict to do it themselves with our backing, rather than putting ourselves on the front line and saying ‘we’ll do it for you.’”

Olsen agreed with Marlow’s comparison of President Trump’s critique of allies who don’t pull their weight on military spending with President Reagan’s desire for “allies, not protectorates.”

“I do work in the belly of the beast, the Swamp, and so I talk a lot to embassies,” Olsen said. “One of the things I’ve learned over the last couple of years is when people in embassies express concern to me over the decline of U.S. leadership, I’ve come to understand that what they mean by that is U.S. do-ership. They’ve become infantilized, and expect America to do everything.”

“Ronald Reagan would not have done that. He wanted allies. He would overlook some faults in our allies as long as they were genuinely helping us. But he wanted allies. He didn’t want, as you call it, protectorates, and he didn’t want infants who just stood around and cried to get the attention of Mom with the military,” Olsen told Marlow.

Olsen also offered his thoughts on how Reagan would have learned from, and adapted to, the tactics of successful Democratic opponents like Barack Obama.

“Ronald Reagan, when he was running for governor, talked about that all this talk about left and right is dividing us down the center,” he recalled. “He campaigned as somebody who was trying to get beyond left and right to express American values. President Reagan would have strongly opposed Obamacare, he would have strongly opposed most of the policies, but Obama learned from Reagan. He learned that Americans want to be unified around a set of goals that have the dignity of the American person at its center. I think a lot of the dismay at people about Obama was that he didn’t govern the way he campaigned, but the way he campaigned was a Democratic version of Ronald Reagan.”

Marlow put forward the key issue of immigration.

“Reagan loved immigrants, but he placed border control first. That’s something that his allies and his advocates or acolytes now often forget,” Olsen replied. “When you take a look at why he said he was signing Simpson-Mazzoli, the last landmark immigration reform bill, it was because we needed to get control of our borders. He wrote in one letter that while he loved refugees, economic migrants, we couldn’t take everybody who wanted to come here because even a country as rich as America couldn’t have the bounty to support them all.”

“I think Ronald Reagan today would be for what he thinks he got in 1986, which was: ‘Let’s close the border to people beyond the number that we can reasonably support, and let’s have real sanctions to make sure that that’s done.’ I mean, he would be for immigration, but not immigration that placed the safety and dignity of the American worker at risk,” he proposed.

Olsen said that Reagan loved free trade, another hot-button issue in the Trump era, “but he loved fair trade.”

“When Ronald Reagan was president, he pushed for CAFTA. He created the idea that eventually became NAFTA. But when he found countries like Japan, a major trading threat in the 1980s, were manipulating trade deals – either by denying access or doing things to give them unfair competitiveness at America – he slapped sanctions on all the time,” he said.

“He created the idea of voluntary auto restraint exports that forced Japanese manufacturers of cars to share the wealth with the American workers by building them here,” Olsen pointed out. “He put sanctions on Japanese semiconductors. He put sanctions on Japanese computers. He put sanctions on Japanese motorcycles, saving Harley-Davidson.”

“So he would have been for fair trade. Free trade, but he would have been really aggressive at protecting American interests when people were competing unfairly. He would have had no problem labeling China a currency manipulator,” he said.

Olsen provided a Reaganesque analysis of the North Korean nuclear crisis by noting that Reagan “would not want a threat to the American people developing.”

“He also was somebody who very carefully thought about our alliances. He was very careful not to spill blood unnecessarily,” he noted. “My guess is if Reagan were around today, he would be going to China and really playing hardball – say, ‘You’re the access of this regime to hard currency, to the West, to travel and everything. You either put up or shut up, and we’re going to make you responsible for this small country, or you’re not going to like the consequences.’”

On the eve of a new Republican tax reform bill’s debut, Olsen firmly stated that “Ronald Reagan always believed in cutting everyone’s taxes.”

“Ronald Reagan did not believe in the supply-side theory of ‘trickle-down,’” he added. “In fact, he disciplined David Stockman, his budget director, who got in hot water in 1981 for saying ‘yeah, it was all a smokescreen to lower the top rate, we believe in trickle-down economics.’ Ronald Reagan never believed in trickle-down economics. In fact, as governor, he would increase taxes on the rich to cut taxes on the middle and working classes.”

“If Ronald Reagan were looking at this bill tomorrow, he would look and say, ‘Does it help American competitiveness?’ He’d be for corporate tax cuts. But does it help everybody? Is there a tax cut so everybody is a winner, especially people on moderate or low-to-moderate income? He would be pushing down the tax relief, rather than focusing it all for the top,” he said.

“So I suspect that if Ronald Reagan’s ghost were to speak to us today, he would look at the tax bill tomorrow and kind of shake his head and say, ‘Supply-siders, there you go again,’” Olsen said.

Marlow concluded the interview by asking what Reagan, “the epitome of dignity and class,” would think of “the crass nature of Donald Trump.”

“He would not like that,” Olsen said plainly. “Ronald Reagan was somebody who believed in making friends. He believed in building alliances. He was somebody who let a lot of criticism roll off his back.”

He recalled how President Reagan was routinely subjected to criticism as vicious as what President Trump endures, “and he just took it with a smile.”

“I think if Ronald Reagan were in the age of Twitter, he would have used it for humor, to defuse his critics with one-liners and jokes, which he was excellent at. I think if Ronald Reagan’s ghost could visit Donald Trump today, he’d put his arm around him and say, ‘You can make so many more friends if you smile than if you growl,’” he said.

Olsen offered a parting observation that he was surprised to learn how frequently Reagan quoted Franklin Roosevelt.

“We remember Ronald Reagan in 1980 closing his debate by saying, ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago?’ That whole section is a direct paraphrase of Franklin Roosevelt’s fifth Fireside Chat,” he noted. “When the chips were down throughout his career, Reagan would use lines or use sentiments that he had heard on the radio fifty years before. This is a man deeply steeped in his idol, who never left him behind.”

Bannon told the American families of illegal alien crime victims during a speech that illegal immigration to the United States comes down to two benefits for the political and economic elite: cheap labor and cheap votes.

During a speech at a conference by the Remembrance Project, an organization made up of the American families who have lost loved ones at the hands of illegal alien criminals, Bannon noted how the country’s elites actually profit from a constant flow of illegal aliens.

“We could stay up here all weekend and do this,” Bannon said after reading off a list of Americans who have been murdered by illegal aliens. “And each of [the victims’ stories] is heart-rendering. But what gets me is what about [the American victims’] dreams? Why are illegal aliens called DREAMers and not [the victims]?”

“And by the way, this just doesn’t happen,” Bannon said of illegal immigration. “This is not some random law of the universe… this is not physics, okay. This is an act of commission. The elites in this country, the economic, political, and the media elites allow this to happen because they want it to happen.”

“The multinational, globalist corporations want cheap labor, and the progressive Left wants cheap votes,” Bannon said. “This is not a conspiracy. And you are not wing-nuts. This is in broad daylight. And if sites like Breitbart and someone like Donald J. Trump had not given you a voice, it’d be totally hidden.”

Despite the benefits of mass illegal and legal immigration for multinational corporations and Democratic politicians — as immigrants are far more likely to vote for Democrats — the impact on Americans has been detrimental.

As Harvard University economist George Borjas has noted, “illegal immigration reduces the wage of native workers by an estimated $99 to $118 billion a year and generates a gain for businesses and other users of immigrants of $107 to $128 billion.”

Every year, at least 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants enter the U.S. every year, driving down the wages of American workers and costing American taxpayers at least $116 billion every year, as Breitbart News reported."

And they are also struggling to address the populist economic nationalist movement led by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who recently gave a foreign policy speech at the respected establishment think tank the Hudson Institute.

From Weiss’ op-ed in the New York Times:

Last week the venerable Hudson Institute, a think tank founded in the early 1960s by the nuclear game theorist Herman Kahn, invited three speakers to discuss foreign policy. Leon Panetta and David Petraeus, both former C.I.A. directors, fit comfortably in the establishment mold in which Hudson has long operated.

Not so the third speaker, Stephen K. Bannon. Donald Trump’s former chief strategist has proudly declared “war” on the Republican Party establishment. And yet that very establishment had laid down the welcome mat to this self-described “Leninist.”

The event offers a snapshot of the dilemma facing conservative think tanks in the era of Trump: How much should they engage not just with this administration, but with the increasingly powerful Bannon wing of the Republican Party?

Think tanks are chiefly supposed to provide independent expertise to policymakers. But they also seek to be politically relevant. To be relevant, you need access. And, of course, they also must answer to well-heeled donors, like the Mercer family, whose political loyalties are sometimes vehemently pro-Trump.

This reality leaves these institutions with an uncomfortable choice: fellow-travel with Mr. Trump or let the Trump train pass your station and risk diminishing influence in a Washington where he is boss."

He has rattled some allies with his vow to ""totally destroy"" North Korea, but told reporters on Air Force One that ""we want to get it solved.""



YOKOTA AIR BASE, Japan (Reuters) - US President Donald Trump arrived in Japan on Sunday defending his tough rhetoric on North Korea, saying discussions on Pyongyang will figure prominently in talks with other Asian leaders as tensions rise over its missile and nuclear tests.

Trump, at the start of a 12-day Asian trip, is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Asia, Trump said a decision would be made soon on whether to add the reclusive state to a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

His administration also planned to take a different approach to dealing with the issue after years of what he termed ""total weakness.""

""We want to get it solved. It's a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved,"" he said.

""And there's been 25 years of total weakness and so we're taking a very much different approach,"" Trump said, without giving any details.

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it threatens the United States and his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a ""rocket man"" on a suicide mission.

North Korea's recent actions, including several missiles that overflew Japan and Pyongyang's sixth and largest nuclear test, have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump's presidency.

Recent drills over South Korea by two US strategic bombers have further raised tensions.

Trump also said he plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, the longest Asian tour by any US leader since George H.W. Bush in 1992.

""I think it's expected that we will meet,"" he said. ""We want Putin's help on North Korea.""

Trump will seek a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before visiting Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

A man has been arrested and charged with assaulting and injuring Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.

Kentucky State Police said in a news release Saturday that Paul suffered a minor injury when 59-year-old Rene Boucher assaulted him at his Warren County home on Friday afternoon.

The release did not provide details of the assault or the nature of Paul's injury. In a statement, Paul spokeswoman Kelsey Cooper said the Republican senator is ""fine."" The statement said Paul was ""blindsided"" by the assault but she did not provide further details.

Police told local ABC affiliate WBKO that Boucher was an acquaintance of Paul, and that the FBI is now investigating the incident.

""FBI is involved making sure it wasn't politically motivated,"" Trooper Hodges, the public affairs officer for the Kentucky State Police, told the outlet.

Boucher, of Bowling Green, is charged with fourth-degree assault with a minor injury. He is being held at Warren County's jail on $5,000 bond.

Hodges said he could not release details of the assault because of security issues. Hodges did say that Boucher is an acquaintance of Paul, an ophthalmologist who was elected to the Senate in 2010. It was not immediately clear how they knew each other.

Hodges said Boucher would have faced more serious charges if had he used a weapon or if Paul had been injured seriously.

""If he was using any type of a dangerous instrument, then it would have been a felony charge,"" Hodges said Saturday.

Also ousted was a prominent prince who headed the National Guard, and the billionaire investor Prince al-Waleed bin Talal.

The government said the anti-corruption committee has the right to issue arrest warrants, impose travel restrictions and freeze bank accounts.



Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Saturday removed a prominent prince who headed the National Guard, replaced the economy minister and announced the creation of a new anti-corruption committee.

Also arrested was the billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a prominent investor in US companies including Twitter and Citigroup, the New York Times reported.

The Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel also reported late Saturday that 11 princes and dozens of former ministers were detained in a new anti-corruption probe headed by the kingdom's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was also named to oversee the new committee.

Al-Arabiya reported that the committee is looking into devastating and deadly floods that overwhelmed parts of the city of Jiddah in 2009 and is investigating the Saudi government's response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus that has killed several hundred people in the past few years.

Meanwhile, the kingdom's top council of clerics issued a statement saying it is an Islamic duty to fight corruption— essentially giving religious backing to the high-level arrests being reported.

The government said the anti-corruption committee has the right to issue arrest warrants, impose travel restrictions and freeze bank accounts. It can also trace funds, prevent the transfer of funds or the liquidation of assets and take other precautionary measures until cases are referred to the judiciary.

The royal order said the committee was established ""due to the propensity of some people for abuse, putting their personal interest above public interest, and stealing public funds.""

Saudi nationals have long complained of rampant corruption in government and of public funds being squandered or misused by people in power.

The 32-year-old crown prince has been seeking to attract greater international investments and improve the country's reputation as a place to do business. It's part of a larger effort to diversify the economy away from dependence on oil revenue.

The king ousted one of the country's highest-level royals from power, removing Prince Miteb bin Abdullah as head of the National Guard. He was replaced by Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin, who had held a senior post with the guard.

Prince Miteb's father was the late King Abdullah, who also had led the National Guard and had transformed it into a powerful and prestigious force tasked with protecting the ruling Al Saud family, as well as important holy sites in Mecca and Medina, and oil and gas sites.

Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne. His ouster as head of the National Guard essentially sidelines one of the most formidable rivals to the current crown prince, who has amassed enormous power in less than three years since his father, King Salman, ascended to the throne.

It comes just three months after Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was ousted from the line of succession and from his post as interior minister, overseeing internal security.

With the two princes now sidelined, control of the kingdom's security apparatus is now largely centralized under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is also defense minister.

The monarch also replaced Minister of Economy and Planning Adel Fakeih with his deputy, Mohammad al-Tuwaijri.

Admiral Abdullah Al-Sultan was also sacked as commander of Saudi Naval Forces and replaced by Admiral Fahd bin Abdullah Al-Ghifaili.

Good news for retirement savers: you can still contribute to your 401(k) on a pre-tax basis, that remained unchanged. But the tax brackets, right now we have seven, will be shrunk down to four.

The standard deduction is getting bigger, but it's in exchange for eliminating many, many itemized deductions. A few of the deductions we could lose are the state and local income tax deduction, student-loan-interest deduction, and a cap on how much mortgage interest you can deduct on your taxes.

Republicans said the typical American family will save $1,182 a year — very, very specific — but that's less than $100 a month, so these aren't huge tax cuts. Here's how you can figure out how much you will save on your taxes.

Start by finding your 2016 tax return. Look at line 37 on page one, that's your adjusted gross income from last year. Don't worry about what that is exactly, just know you need that number.

Then, take a look at the second page. Lines 40 and 42 are your deductions and exemptions from 2016. What the Republicans are proposing is collapsing those into one big standard deduction: $12,000 if you're single, $24,000 if you're married filing jointly. You can compare what you paid last year to those numbers to see which one is better for you.

Next, take your adjusted gross income, that's line 37 from page one, and subtract out either the $12,000 standard deduction or the $24,000, depending on if you're single or married, to come up with your taxable income under Trump's proposed plan.

Compare that number to line 43 on your 2016 tax return. That's the amount you paid taxes on last year. The lower this number is, the less you pay in taxes.

Once you know your estimated taxable income using Trump's new plan, you can actually run the numbers using the tax brackets they've laid out. Simple as that! Then you can compare how much you would pay in taxes under Trump's plan to what you paid in 2016 and that's how much you could end up saving or paying more in 2018."

Trump also sought to distance himself from Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman who was indicted on 12 counts on Monday.

The president continued to say he's not under investigation, contrary to several media reports over the last few months.



President Donald Trump said in an interview that he hopes special counsel Robert Mueller is ""treating everything fairly"" as he investigates Russia's interference in the 2016 election, which involves looking into whether any members of the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to sway the race in his favor.

""Well, I hope he's treating everything fairly,"" Trump told ""Full Measure"" host Sharyl Attkisson in an interview that will air on Sunday. ""And if he is, I'm going to be very happy, because when you talk about innocent, I am truly not involved in any collusion with Russia.

""Believe me, that's the last thing I can think of to be involved in,"" Trump added.

Trump's defense team has been cooperating with Mueller's investigation, largely at the urging of Ty Cobb, the white-collar defense attorney leading the president's legal team, who has argued that cooperating with the special counsel will ensure that the investigation concludes quickly and smoothly, and without the president getting caught in the crosshairs.

But Jay Sekulow, another attorney on Trump's defense team, told Politico on Thursday he will lodge a complaint against Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — who appointed Mueller special counsel in May — if Mueller looks too closely at Trump's prior business dealings.

Trump also addressed issues surrounding Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman who was indicted on Monday along with his longtime associate, Rick Gates, as part of Mueller's investigation.

""Paul was not there very long,"" Trump said of Manafort's tenure on the campaign.

Manafort joined the operation in March 2016 and departed in August, three days after The New York Times reported that Ukraine's pro-Russian Party of Regions had earmarked $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments for Manafort for his work consulting for the party between 2007 and 2012.

Explaining why Manafort left the campaign, Trump said, ""Well, I think we found out something about he may be involved with all — with certain nations, and I don't even know exactly what it was in particular.""

He continued: ""But there was a point at which we just felt Paul would be better off, because we don't want to have many potential conflicts.""

Because of his extensive ties to Russia, Manafort has been a subject of red-hot focus from Mueller's team.

The former campaign chairman was indicted Monday on 12 counts, including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money; unregistered agent of a foreign principal; false and misleading Foreign Agents Registration Act statements; false statements; and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts.

When Trump first hired Manafort in last March, Manafort was known for having worked as a top consultant to former Ukrainian president and pro-Russian strongman Viktor Yanukovych, and is widely credited with helping him win the election in 2010. Yanukovych is a prominent figure in the Party of Regions.

In July, The New York Times reported on financial records Manafort filed in Cyprus that showed he was $17 million in debt to pro-Russian interests when he joined the campaign.

Manafort is also associated with Oleg Deripaska, a wealthy Russian oligarch with known ties to the Kremlin. Deripaska's representatives claimed, in legal complaints filed in the Cayman Islands in 2014, that Manafort had disappeared after Deripaska gave him $19 million to invest in a failed Ukrainian TV venture.

Earlier this month, The Atlantic published several emails that appeared to show Manafort using his elevated role in the Trump campaign to resolve the dispute with Deripaska, by offering him ""private briefings"" on the campaign.

Manafort was also one of three top Trump campaign members, in addition to Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr., who attended a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer offering damaging information on then Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Trump said during his interview with Attkisson that no one has informed him that Mueller plans to question him.

""As far as I'm concerned, I haven't been told that we're under investigation,"" Trump said. ""I'm not under investigation."""

The announcement marks the latest failed attempt to combine the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, as Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp, and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG, show unwillingness to part with their prized U.S. telecom assets.

The companies' unusual step of making a joint announcement on the canceled negotiations could indicate they still recognize the merits of a merger and could keep the door open for potential future talks.

The companies said they ended talks because they ""were unable to find mutually agreeable terms.""

A combined company would have had more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.

John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile US Inc, said in the statement that the prospect of combining with Sprint was compelling but ""we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile's shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record.""

Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in the statement that even though the companies could not reach a deal, ""we certainly recognize the benefits of scale through a potential combination."" He saidSprint has agreed it is best to move forward on its own with ""significant assets, including our rich spectrum holdings, and are accelerating significant investments in our network to ensure our continued growth.""

The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014 but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

Industry executives have said a combined Sprint-T-Mobile entity would have the scale, network and enhanced portfolio of wireless airwaves that could enable it to better compete with AT&T and Verizon on 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.

Legal experts also said earlier this year that it was difficult to predict whether the current administration would be more receptive of a deal. Industry executives have expressed optimism about the prospect of consolidation on earnings calls. But President Donald Trump has also made populist comments on antitrust and prioritized job creation as a key platform.

The tech companies' CEOs declined to show.

The companies' lawyers failed to reassure legislators and the public that the companies are prepared to fix the problems that allowed people and groups linked to Russia to abuse their platforms.



Big Tech's big appearance in Washington this week was a big disappointment.

Congressional representatives have been investigating Russia's alleged meddling in last year's election. They called on Facebook, Google, and Twitter to testify about what happened and what the companies are doing to prevent similar propaganda efforts in the future. Mostly it was a chance for the big tech companies to show they are taking the problem seriously.

But on just about every level, Big Tech failed. The companies sent their lawyers instead of their top brass, a pretty good indication of how much of a priority they're making of this problem.

While the companies' lawyers assured the members of Congress that their companies take this issue seriously and are taking steps to make sure it never happens again, we've heard similar talk before. Facebook, Google, and Twitter have routinely shown they can't handle such challenges, and they gave little reason to think things would be different this time around.

And when pressed about what happened last year, the companies' lawyers offered a slew of excuses. Overall, they conveyed the sense that Big Tech feels it's largely blameless for what happened. And they gave little reason to hope that their companies would make many real changes to how they do business.

After two days of hearings, it was hard to feel optimistic.

Here are the most important takeaways from the hearings:

The CEOs didn't show

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey all declined to testify at the hearings. That was bad enough. But just how little importance Big Tech's leaders ascribed to the hearings can be gleaned from one Facebook post.

Here's what Zuckerberg was up to on October 31, the first day of the hearings:

By sending their lawyers (Colin Stretch for Facebook, Sean Edgett for Twitter, and Richard Salgado and Kent Walker for Google), Big Tech sent a message to Congress and the American people that it didn't think its CEOs should be held accountable for the abuse on their platforms, whether before, during, or after the election.

Yes, Congress could've subpoenaed the CEOs and forced them to testify, but it shouldn't have had to take that step. Zuckerberg, Pichai, and Dorsey should have shown up on their own and taken responsibility for what's happened and happening on their sites. Instead, Zuckerberg thought it was more important to dress up like a Wild Thing.

Fake news, personal attacks, and other abuse are still big problems on these companies' sites. The midterm elections are just a year away, and we have no assurance under oath from Big Tech's top leadership that their companies are working to make the changes needed to safeguard those elections from similar meddling in time. Instead, all we're getting are promises that they'll do better.

Facebook wouldn't commit to rejecting foreign currency as payment for US political advertising

Perhaps the most frustrating moment during the hearings was when Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota asked Facebook's Stretch if the company would stop allowing people to pay for political ads shown in the US with Russian rubles, North Korean won, or other foreign currencies.

Stretch danced around the issue quite a bit, but his answer was essentially that Facebook wouldn't commit to that. The bigger message from that exchange? Facebook values making money over making sure political ads are legitimate.

I share Franken's sentiment to Stretch's answer:

The companies refused to acknowledge they're in the media business

Ah, the tiresome media company debate again. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana asked the Big Tech companies if they were in the media business or were simply agnostic technology platforms. Surprise! Each company's lawyer declared his company an agnostic tech platform.

This despite the fact that all three companies distribute news and other media to billions of people each day, act as a primary news source for millions here in the US, and make money by selling advertising that they runs next to or place within news articles and videos.

Even if the Big Tech platforms don't want to label themselves as such, the fact is that they basically are media companies. And they ought to have the same responsibilities as other media companies to vet the content and ads they distribute.

None of the companies would commit to supporting the Honest Ads Act

Last month, senators Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar introduced the Honest Ads Act, which would require online political ads to contain similar disclosures about who paid for them as are found in print, broadcast, and radio ads. If the bill were enacted, you would be able to see if the election ad in your Facebook News Feed were funded by a political candidate's campaign, a political action committee — or a Russia-linked group looking to stir up trouble.

Before the hearings, Facebook and Twitter committed to putting in place new transparency rules for political advertising. But they declined to voice support for the Honest Ads Act, despite its similar goal. Google, which has yet to announce any transparency rules of its own, likewise declined to explicitly endorse the bill.

It makes sense that Big Tech prefers self-regulation to government regulation, no matter how modest the latter. But that doesn't mean that allowing those companies to regulate themselves makes sense for the rest of us.

Big Tech has repeatedly failed to do even an adequate job of policing itself. Even with fake news and fake ads in the spotlight, the companies couldn't block the distribution of bogus stories in recent weeks about the mass shooting in Las Vegas or the controversy over NFL players kneeling to protest the treatment of African Americans. So, there's little reason to believe they'll successfully regulate political ads without being prompted to by the government.

Legislators were unduly obsessed with Russia Today

Members of Congress asked a lot of legitimate and important questions during the hearings. But they spent way too much time asking and talking about Russia Today (RT), a news organization funded by the Russian government.

RT distributes its news videos through cable, satellite, and the internet, via sites including Google's YouTube. In many ways, it's a traditional news source, albeit one skewed toward Russian interests. And RT is clear and transparent when it is promoting its content; you can see it is behind its videos and articles.

There are good arguments for blocking Russia-linked bots and fake accounts from spreading fake news or placing propagandistic ads. But blocking RT and suppressing its speech would set a dangerous precedent. And the tech companies were right to point out during the hearings the distinction between RT's posts and those of the Russia-linked bots.

Unfortunately, members of Congress wasted a lot of valuable time using RT as an example of Big Tech's failures.

The companies still don't know the extent of the Russia-linked propaganda effort

Legislators repeatedly pressed Facebook, Google, and Twitter's lawyers about whether their companies were confident they had uncovered, on their respective platforms, all of the Russia-linked propaganda from the 2016 election. None could say ""yes"" definitively.

Instead the representatives of all three companies gave the same general answers: Their companies are continuing to investigate, and there's a possibility they will discover more Russia-linked fake news and ads.

It's frightening that even now, more than a year after the election, we still don't know the extent of the Russia-linked propaganda effort. And it's disturbing that the companies are basically saying that the drip-drip-drip of revelations is likely to continue.

There's little reason for optimism

Following the hearings, there was little reason to hope that the problem of Big Tech being used to spread foreign propaganda has been or will soon be solved anytime. The companies, of course, promised they'd fix the problems on their own. However, after so many past promises and failures, there's little reason to believe they'll get things right now.

But the companies do have an extra incentive this time around. Congress is keenly focused on this issue. Big Tech now has a chance — maybe its last chance — to address these problems before, as Senator Diane Feinstein said during the hearings, Congress acts."

Republicans have begun pushing back on calls from Democrats to protect Mueller, with some conservative lawmakers calling for Mueller to recuse himself from the investigation.

President Donald Trump has attacked the FBI and Department of Justice repeatedly over the last week, but insists he is not ""angry at anybody.""



Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told MSNBC on Saturday that he didn't think Congress needed to pass legislation protecting special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired by President Donald Trump.

MSNBC host Hugh Hewitt pointed out to McConnell that in light of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's and campaign adviser Rick Gates' indictments, opposing sides have gained traction in Congress.

""Some want legislation to restrain his power and limit his reach,"" Hewitt said, referring to Mueller. ""Others want legislation to keep him safe from being fired. Do you think Congress has any role in legislating about the special counsel right now?""

""I don't hear much pressure to pass anything,"" McConnell replied. ""There's been no indication the president or the White House are not cooperating with the special counsel.""

""I think the view up here is: let him do his job,"" McConnell added.

Despite Trump's recent attacks against the FBI and the Department of Justice, his team of defense lawyers, spearheaded by white-collar defense attorney Ty Cobb, have largely cooperated with Mueller's investigation by handing over key documents on time and making White House staffers available for interviews. Last month, it was also reported that Trump's defense team had mulled over offering the special counsel an interview with the president.

Before Manafort's and Gates' indictments this week, as well as revelations that early campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents about his Russian contacts, several senators introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at protecting Mueller and the independent investigation.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons introduced a bill that would have allowed Mueller or any other special counsel to challenge their firing in a court of law.

Another bill, brought by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, would require that a judge approve the Justice Department's request to dismiss Mueller or any special counsel.

Republicans are pushing back

But after Monday's indictments, Republicans began pushing back against calls to protect Mueller, with some even recommending that he distance himself from the investigation.

On Friday, for instance, several conservative lawmakers introduced a resolution calling on Mueller to recuse himself because he was the FBI director in 2010 when US government agencies approved the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian energy company, to a Russian nuclear-energy firm. The deal required approval because Uranium One had mining operations in the US.

Graham, who co-sponsored one of the bills aimed at protecting Mueller's independence, said after the indictments that he did not ""feel an urgent need to pass that law until you show me a reason Mr. Mueller is in jeopardy.""

""I don't think anybody in their right mind in the White House would think about replacing Mr. Mueller,"" he said.

Although Trump has repeatedly slammed the FBI and Justice Department for not investigating ""Crooked Hillary"" and the Democrats for what he alleged was collusion between them and Russia, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday afternoon that ""there's no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to special counsel.""

Trump also told The New York Times on Wednesday that he was not ""angry at anybody.""

""I'm not under investigation, as you know,"" Trump told The Times.

Multiple revelations over the last few months appear to contradict the president's claim. Mueller is said to be building an obstruction-of-justice case against Trump related to his decision to fire James Comey as FBI director in May. At the time, Comey was spearheading the bureau's Russia investigation. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller to be special counsel shortly after Trump fired Comey.

Mueller is also reportedly investigating Trump for his involvement in crafting a misleading statement that his son, Donald Trump Jr., released following reports that he met with a Russian lawyer offering dirt on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in June 2016 at Trump Tower."

Here's how that looks as a chart:

The slowdown — which is already starting to bite, with negative price growth measured in the third quarter this year — is being driven by bloated prices in the capital, slow progress in Brexit negotiations, and worries about further interest rate hikes from the Bank of England, which drive up mortgage costs.

The site was plagued by internet trolls and protesting users in the years that followed. Meanwhile, the cofounders' relationship faltered outside the office.

The pair went to therapy, mended their friendship, and returned to Reddit.

Today, it's one of the most widely read sites on the internet.

Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman were 22 years old when they sold Reddit, a popular online community, to publishing house Condé Nast for between $10 million and $20 million.

They sold it within two years of starting the company.

The pair shared the experience and the drama that followed during a live podcast taping of ""How I Built This"" with NPR's Guy Raz in San Francisco in August.

""This was 16 months of work that was going to mean more money for me than my entire family — my mother and father — had made in their entire lives,"" Ohanian told Raz on stage.

Reddit, the so-called ""front page of the internet,"" is now valued at $1.8 billion. But before it became the eighth most popular site on the internet, Reddit nearly met an early end.

In the years following the site's sale, the company was almost taken over by by internet trolls. Users protesting internal issues at Reddit tried to shut the site down, and a revolving door of CEOs did little to stabilize the startup's reputation. Ohanian and Huffman, who took a hiatus from Reddit, were absent during much of that time. Meanwhile, their relationship soured.

Here's how the duo bounced back to save Reddit. (Check out the podcast for the full story.)

Ohanian and Huffman were friends before they were cofounders

The pair met on the first day of college — their dorm rooms were located across the hall from each other at University of Virginia — and played countless hours of PlayStation 2 over the years. As juniors, they hatched an idea for an app (not Reddit) and went into business together.

After a fateful meeting with investor Paul Graham over their spring break, they joined the inaugural class of Y Combinator, a tech startup accelerator, and set out to create Reddit.

Reddit grew to become the 11th biggest site in the world with 70,000 unique visitors by 2006. When Ohanian and Huffman sold it that year to Condé Nast's parent company, Advance Publications, they joined the media giant as part of their contracts. For three years, they worked on a celebrity-gossip news aggregator, Lipstick.com, that used Reddit's underlying tech.

After eight years of living together, Huffman parted for San Francisco and Ohanian spent some time in Armenia, where his dad's family came from. Their friendship began to falter. They rarely spoke, about Reddit or their lives outside the office, they told NPR.

""When our contracts at Condé Nast expired, we kind of just said, 'Great, see you later,"" Ohanian said during the taping

""I didn't feel animosity, it was neglect,"" Huffman said.

They came together when Reddit needed them

In 2015, about five years since Ohanian and Huffman left Reddit, the company looked like it might go under. Internet trolls were spewing messages of hate across the site, and many moderators — users who supervise Reddit's thousands of forums — took their communities offline in protest of a key Reddit staffer's departure. The Southern Poverty Law Center pegged Reddit as an online bulletin board for the most violently racist content on the internet.

At the same time, Ohanian and Huffman started to repair their friendship.

""We never really exercised the muscles that founders have to exercise that best friends don't,"" Ohanian explained during the podcast. ""It's great to be able to start a company with one of your best friends, but the conversations you have as cofounders are very different from the conversations you have as friends. We didn't have enough of the hard ones often enough.""

The pair met for dinner in February 2015 and began to take inventory of the events and actions that caused their relationship to fall apart. They agreed at that first dinner to work on it.

""We actually saw my therapist [together],"" Huffman told NPR.

While they made strides in mending their friendship, operations at Reddit continued to unravel. Ellen Pao resigned as interim CEO in June 2015.

Ohanian served as a board member of Reddit at the time. He called Huffman for back-up.

""I remember my friends being like, 'Why are you running into that burning building?' And it just felt like, at the time, I had no choice. I really, really loved Reddit,"" Huffman told NPR. He said the computer engineer in him — not the CEO — believed he could fix Reddit's code and reclaim the site from trolls. Huffman was installed as the new permanent CEO in July 2015.

The number of employees at Reddit doubled in the year that followed, which helped Huffman address the company's myriad issues. Reddit improved a feature to block users and debuted a quarantine for offensive content, making it harder for people to find.

The company also launched Android and iOS apps, and within one year, more than half of the site's users viewed Reddit on mobile devices. Monthly unique visitors ballooned to 243 million.

Ohanian and Huffman remain close friends."
Joe Ciolli,Bank of America Merrill Lynch says traders are...,2017-11-04T10:15:00Z,business-insider-uk,BAML: Investors are still getting one key thing wrong about the market,http://uk.businessinsider.com/interest-rates-investors-continuing-to-misprice-expectations-2017-11,http://static2.uk.businessinsider.com/image/595909c6bb35030c3e1b2134-1190-625/baml-investors-are-still-getting-one-key-thing-wrong-about-the-market.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Bank of America Merrill Lynch says traders are continuing to misprice how quickly rates are going to rise.

The firm recommends going long the US dollar and hedging against stock declines in the face of higher interest rates.

Investors are underestimating how quickly the economy is growing. At least that's what Bank of America Merrill Lynch says with regards to interest rate expectations.

The firm notes that while the US rates market has repriced in recent months, it's still unprepared for what it thinks will be the pace of rate increases over the next year or so. It also trails median forecasts from the Fed's so-called dot plot, which summarizes rate forecasts from the members of the Federal Open Market Committee.

""Stronger growth is causing markets to reprice US rate expectations to the upside,"" BAML investment strategist James Barty wrote in a client note. ""Yet expectations remain well below the dot plot. We think further adjustment is needed, pushing yields and the USD higher into year end.""

The end of Barty's quote touches upon one of BAML's recommendations for playing this wrinkle in the market. The firm says to expect strength in the US dollar, which should also get a boost from corporate tax reform and the likely repatriation of billions of dollars from overseas. The greenback has rallied slightly from a multi-year low reached earlier this year, but it's still nowhere near recent highs.

From a stocks perspective, BAML has an idea how to purchase protection. It suggests that traders buy so-called ""fragility hedges"" using options contracts. The firm specifically recommends shorting one S&P 500 put contract on the benchmark falling to 2,300 by June for every two put contracts bet long on the index to hit 2,500 by the end of December. The equity benchmark closed at 2,587.84 on Friday.

BAML explained the attractiveness of the entry point comes from the steepness of the S&P 500's term structure, where near-dated contracts are expensive relative to those further in the future. Further, put skew — or the degree to which future protection is more expensive than at-the-money options — is high because of the market's tendency to buy more stock exposure on short-term dips.

You can see that dynamic at play in the chart below.

So now you know what to do to prepare yourself for higher rates in the future: go long the US dollar and buy some downside stock protection."
Matt Weinberger,Nintendo is on one of the hottest streaks of...,2017-11-04T14:00:00Z,business-insider-uk,Forget the Nintendo Switch — here are 5 reasons to buy the Nintendo 3DS instead,http://uk.businessinsider.com/nintendo-3ds-vs-nintendo-switch-2017-11,http://static1.uk.businessinsider.com/image/59fb1b929361af481806376b-1190-625/forget-the-nintendo-switch--here-are-5-reasons-to-buy-the-nintendo-3ds-instead.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"1. Price The Nintendo Switch costs $299. Meanwhile, the cheapest member of the Nintendo 3DS family of systems costs $79. Wait, ""family"" of systems? Stick with me here, because this is where it gets a little complicated. Nintendo offers a selection of consoles, in different shapes and sizes, all of which can play Nintendo 3DS games. The lineup, as you'll see on store shelves this holiday season: Nintendo 2DS ($79) — Not only is it the cheapest option, but it comes with a game pre-installed. You can buy a 2DS bundled with ""Mario Kart 7,"" ""New Super Mario Bros 2,"" or, starting on Black Friday this year, ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D."" The drawbacks: It doesn't offer Nintendo's neat glasses-less 3D feature (if that's what you're into), you can't scan Nintendo's Amiibo figurines without a dongle, and it doesn't support buying and downloading classic Super Nintendo games like ""Super Mario World,"" as the others do. New Nintendo 2DS XL ($150) — The most recent addition to the line, and probably the best balance between power and price on the menu. It boasts a clamshell design, so you can fold it up and shove it in a pocket or backpack without worrying about damaging the screen. The only real trade-off is that you lose that same glasses-less 3D feature. But honestly, you won't miss it. New Nintendo 3DS XL ($199) — The best of the best, the tip of the top. It has all the same specs as the 2DS XL, but also has that 3D feature. It's not strictly necessary, but the 3DS XL is for those who don't want to limit their options.

2. Aesthetics Props to Nintendo for letting users customize their Nintendo Switch consoles — you can buy the system's Joy-Con controllers in an expanding range of colors, adding some flair. But if you want something that really stands out, the 3DS might be the console for you. When you buy a Nintendo 2DS, it'll come with a version of the console in a color scheme to match the game it comes with — red and blue for ""Mario Kart 7;"" green and gold for ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D."" There's also a $159 version of the New Nintendo 2DS that looks like a Pokéball, of ""Pokémon fame."" Otherwise, you can get it in a slick-looking black-and-blue or black-and-orange configuration.

3. Battery life The Nintendo Switch gets three, maybe four hours of battery life when it's not connected to power, depending on what you're playing. Meanwhile, the New Nintendo 2DS XL and New Nintendo 3DS XL both get around 7 hours of playtime — though you'll get less if you use the 3D effects on the 3DS. The 2DS tops out at around 5.5 hours, which is still better than the Switch.

4. Apps like Netflix and Hulu Believe it or not, the Nintendo 3DS offers apps for Netflix, Hulu, and even a web browser. Plus, the New Nintendo 2DS and 3DS have cameras on the outside that you can use to take 2D and 3D photos. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch offers none of the above. It's a nice little perk for 3DS owners.

5. Games! This is the big one. While the Nintendo Switch has some truly amazing games — including ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" and the brand-new ""Super Mario Odyssey"" — it's still in the earliest stages of building out its games library. Meanwhile, the Nintendo 3DS has been around in some form since 2011, and there are well over 1,200 titles available at the time of writing. That includes some of Nintendo's top franchises, like...

Super Mario! The 3DS is a magnificent Mario machine. Just in terms of ""Super Mario"" titles, you've got: ""Super Mario 3D Land,"" a great 3D platformer.

""New Super Mario Bros. 2,"" a retro-tinged side-scrolling Mario game that supports two players at the same time.

""Mario Kart 7,"" a fabulous entry in the long-running racing franchise.

""Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions,"" a remake of the classic Game Boy Advance role-playing game.

""Paper Mario: Sticker Star,"" another roleplaying game with a papercraft aesthetic.

And more besides, believe it or not.

Zelda! ""The Legend of Zelda"" is one of Nintendo's biggest franchises, and the 3DS is home to several amazing games in the series. ""The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds"" is an all-new sequel to the Super Nintendo's classic ""Link to the Past."" This game is easily a high point for the ""Zelda"" series overall, so don't miss this one.

""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D"" is a remake of the 1998 Nintendo 64 classic. ""Ocarina"" brought Zelda into three dimensions for the very first time, and it's well worth revisiting now.

""The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D"" is also a Nintendo 64 remake. This is one of the oddest and darkest titles in the series, but also one of the most challenging and rewarding.

Pokémon! Nintendo promises that a proper new game in the Pokémon series is coming to the Nintendo Switch in the not-too-distant future. Until then, if you gotta catch 'em all, the 3DS is the only game in town. And in just a few weeks, on November 17th, the 3DS will get the next games in the series: Pokémon Ultra Sun and Pokémon Ultra Moon. The regular old Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon are still available too, and they're pretty great.

And more. From the recent ""Metroid: Samus Returns,"" to the classic ""Animal Crossing: New Leaf,"" to oddball titles like ""Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney: Spirit of Justice,"" the 3DS has something for everybody."

It's a game society,"" Rob Kapito said.

""The winners are going to be the people who have that game, the technology, and the brand.""



LONDON — The cofounder of BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, thinks financial services companies need to be more like games developers to win over millennial investors.

""Millennials want to game. It's a game society,"" Rob Kapito said at the Barclays New Frontier conference in London on Thursday.

""Most people use Uber because they'll say you've got the card, it's already paid for, it shows up — that's not why people really like it. They love watching the car come get them. It's a game. All of the technology is gamification,"" he said.

""What we need to do is find the financial game that makes people feel comfort and safety. The winners, in my opinion, are going to be the people who have that game, have the technology, and have the brand.""

Earlier this year BlackRock invested €30 million into Scalable Capital, a European app-only investment platform. BlackRock, which manages $5.7 trillion globally, also acquired FutureAdvisor, an automated investment platform, in 2015.

Kapito, who is also BlackRock's president, said the asset manager was also adapting its working culture to suit millennial staff. He joked that a recent office redesign looked to him ""like a diner"" with booths and places to stand. He added that businesses need to offer more flexible working hours and routines to accommodate millennials.

Kapito, who was being interviewed by Barclays CEO Jes Staley, also discussed the role of artificial intelligence in financial services, saying machines won't replace humans."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - More than 1,000 people protested in Australia on Saturday against the treatment of hundreds of asylum seekers in an offshore detention center that the United Nations has described as an ""unfolding humanitarian emergency"".

About 600 men have barricaded themselves inside the camp on remote Manus island in Papua New Guinea, defying efforts by Australia and PNG to shut it. Food, running water and medical services were cut off by Australia four days ago.

Australian authorities want the men moved to a transit center elsewhere on the island at the start of a process the asylum seekers fear will result in them being resettled in PNG or another developing nation.

The men also fear violent reprisals from the local community.

""These people have committed no crime other than to do what every single one of us would do if we thought our lives, or our family's lives, were at risk,"" Federal Greens lawmaker Adam Bandt told the crowd in Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city.

Another smaller protest was staged in Sydney.

The Manus island center, and one on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, have been key parts of Australia's disputed ""Sovereign Borders"" immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores.

Australia's offshore detention policies have been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups but are backed the center-right government and the Labor opposition.

U.N. rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news conference in Geneva on Friday about the ""unfolding humanitarian emergency"" in the Manus island center, where asylum seekers have been reported digging wells to try to find water.

The Australian government has not responded to Colville's comments. It frequently does not comment on issues concerning the offshore centers, citing operational reasons.

The relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of asylum seekers as part of a refugee swap deal, agreed on last year, under which Australia will accept refugees from Central America.

Labor leader Bill Shorten has called on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to consider New Zealand's offer to take 150 refugees from the camps on Manus and Nauru.

China's rapid economic emergence in the 1970s, and an explosion in the global working-age population, has allowed inflation to be controlled externally, but that period is coming to an end.

What could replace fiat currency is yet to be determined.

LONDON — Deutsche Bank isn't known for its gold bugs, but that hasn't stopped its strategist Jim Reid from writing a paper which discusses ""the start of the end of fiat money.""

Reid's basic contention is this: The dominance of the fiat currency system since Richard Nixon decoupled gold from the dollar in 1971 ""is inherently unstable and prone to high inflation,"" and an offsetting disinflationary shock that kept it afloat since 1980 is now slowly reversing.

If that's the case, Reid says the fiat currency system — a term which describes any currency whose value is backed by the government that issued it, rather than by a commodity like gold or silver — could be ""seriously tested"" over the next decade.

Disinflationary forces

The basis of Reid's argument is that China's rapid economic emergence in the 1970s, and an explosion in the global working-age population, has allowed inflation to be controlled externally, because a boost in labour supply during a period of globalisation naturally supressed wages.

Externally-controlled inflation means policy-makers and central banks can respond with familiar tools: More leverage, loose policy, and extensive money-printing.

""It's not usually this easy as inflation would have normally increased with such stimulus and credit creation,"" says Reid. In fact, ""it could be argued that this external disinflation shock has perhaps 'saved' fiat currencies.""

An end to the demographic super-cycle

If this theory is correct, Reid says, then ""any reversals in this demographic super cycle could spell problems for the fiat currency system.""

Under that scenario, inflation would pick up externally as the working-age population stopped rising and labour pricing power returned, as demand rose and supply shortened.

Reid continues:

""Central banks and governments which have ‘dined out’ on the 35 year secular, structural decline in inflation are not able to prevent it rising as raising interest rates to suitable levels would risk serious economic contraction given the huge debt burden economies face.

As such they are forced to prioritise low interest rates and nominal growth over inflation control which could herald in the beginning of the end of the global fiat currency system that begun with the abandonment of Bretton Woods back in 1971.""

After fiat currency

Eventually, Reid says, ""it’s possible that inflation becomes more and more uncontrollable and the era of fiat currencies looks vulnerable as people lose faith in paper money.""

One such alternative is cryptocurrency, which uses blockchain, a much-hyped online ledger system whose primary benefit lies in the difficulty of tampering with data recorded within it.

""Although the current speculative interest in cryptocurrencies is more to do with blockchain technology than a loss of faith in paper money, at some point there will likely be some median of exchange that becomes more universal and a competitor of paper money,"" Reid says."

The nine justices were unanimous in dismissing an appeal from the Ktunaxa Nation against the construction of the Jumbo Glacier resort in British Columbia's Kootenays region.

The First Nation considers the area, known as Qat’muk, as a sacred place and home to the Grizzly Bear Spirit. They argued against the construction of the year-round ski resort on spiritual and ecological grounds, saying it would hurt local grizzly populations.

The justices, however, said in their decision that the project ""does not violate the Ktunaxa's right to freedom of religion.""

""With this decision, the Supreme Court of Canada is telling every Indigenous person in Canada that your culture, history, and spirituality, all deeply linked to the land, are not worthy of legal protection from the constant threat of destruction,"" said Kathryn Teneese, Ktunaxa Nation Council chair, in a statement."

Saudi Arabia's King Salman removed a host of prominent officials in a sweeping crackdown, in which dozens of princes and former ministers were detained. News outlets, including Saudi-owned Al Arabiya and The Wall Street Journal, reported Bin Talal was among those arrested. CNBC could not immediately confirm Bin Talal's status.

In addition to Bin Talal, former Finance Minister Ibrahim Al-Assaf was also detained and under investigation, Reuters reported, citing a senior Saudi official.

If verified, the arrest of Bin Talal would represent a jarring turn of events as the prince has cultivated an image as the de-facto public face of Saudi finance. It would also be the most dramatic chapter in the evolving narrative of Bin Salman, who has steadily consolidated his authority since his elevation to Defense Minister in early 2015.

Considered one of the most prominent members of the Saudi royal family, Bin Talal has been the subject of numerous profiles in U.S. and international publications. He has made numerous appearances on CNBC dispensing investment advice — such as last month, when he predicted bitcoin was little more than a speculative bubble that would soon ""implode""

The billionaire is an American-educated philanthropist and investor who is heavily invested in U.S. corporate giants like Citigroup, Apple, 21st Century Fox and Twitter, just to name a few. Between 1991 and 1995, bin Talal came to the rescue of President Donald Trump, whose real estate empire was under strain. Bin Talal purchased a yacht, and invested in Trump's Plaza Hotel.

In 2015, Bin Talal announced he would donate his entire fortune to help build a ""better world of tolerance, acceptance, equality and opportunity for all.""

The anti-corruption sweep is taking place against a backdrop of reform in Saudi Arabia, and the impending launch of an initial public offering for state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco next year. The IPO is expected to be the largest in history, and Aramco is widely expected to dual-list shares on an international exchange."

The king ousted one of the country's highest-level royals from power, relieving Prince Miteb bin Abdullah of his post as head of the National Guard. Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne.

Dudley, who has has headed the bank since 2009, will likely retire sometime in the spring or summer of 2018 when his replacement is found and approved, sources told CNBC. His term ends in January 2019. A search committee has already been formed.

Dudley, who will be 65 next year, took the helm of the New York Fed when the banking system was still in the throes of the worst financial crisis of the post-war era.

He previously had headed the New York Fed's markets group, a critical job that oversees the trades and market operations required to set the Federal Funds Rate. In both positions, Dudley was a principal player in Fed decisions concerning the demise of Lehman Brothers, AIG and Bear Stearns, along with emergency measures taken by the central bank to stanch a meltdown in the financial system.

Largely under Dudley, the NY Fed was responsible for accumulating the trillions in assets the Fed purchased as part of the quantitative easing program, bringing its balance sheet up to $4.5 trillion. It is now responsible for the market operations underway to reduce the balance sheet.

Dudley had told several colleagues he was planning to leave in 2018, and his departure is said not to be related to the decision last week by President Donald Trump to name Fed Governor Jerome Powell as the next Fed Chairman. In doing so, Trump declined to renominate current Chair Janet Yellen, with whom Dudley has worked closely over the past several years.

Dudley's departure comes at a time of dramatic change at the Fed. in addition to a new Fed Chairman, Vice Chairman Stan Fischer left his post in October, and there are currently three open seats on the seven-member Board of Governors. That number may rise to four if Yellen leaves the board when Powell is confirmed, and before others are nominated and confirmed by the Senate.

As president of the New York Fed, Dudley holds a special spot among the dozen regional bank presidents. The incumbent always serves as vice chairman of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and always votes at policy meetings, while other regional presidents have a rotating vote.

The choice of Dudley's replacement will be made by the New York Fed's Board of Directors and approved by the Federal Reserve Board.

Prior to joining the New York Fed, Dudley was the chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, and a managing director.

Representatives at the New York Fed declined to comment."

Penney will no longer have a chief merchandising officer, once one of the most powerful jobs in retail, further demonstrating the industry's turmoil.

Its current CMO John Tighe, will be leaving the company and will not be replaced, the retailer said on Friday.

The erstwhile glorified ability of industry leaders to spot trends in advance, which catapulted many retail executives to the role of CEO, has become increasingly irrelevant. Simply, fashion no longer brings shoppers to stores; it is an evolving mix of service, selection and price.

Amazon and Wal-Mart are experimenting with in-home package delivery. Kohl's is accepting Amazon returns in its stores. Subscription services like Stitch Fix are choosing and shipping clothes for clients through data-driven personal shopping. Grocer Kroger is joining Lidl in entering the apparel business.

As for fashion, buyers can no longer spot or drive trends a year in advance as they once could (a chain of events made famous by The Devil Wears Prada.) Fast fashion has trained shoppers to see fads by the week, not the season.

J.C. Penney saw its shares drop to an all-time low last month, when it slashed 2017 profit and comparable-sales forecasts because it had to slice prices of unsold women's apparel. The retailer, which has a market capitalization of $736.5 million, has watched its shares drop 88 percent over the past five years.

""This simplified structure offers greater flexibility, which is critical to ensuring our assortment remains fresh and relevant, and compels more shoppers to choose JCPenney,"" said Penney CEO Marvin Ellison of the change, in a press release.

For J.C. Penney, the shift also comes as the retailer is looking to focus on selling appliances rather than apparel, amid a broader drop in the amount shoppers are spending on clothes.

But the department store still makes a significant amount of its sales from clothes. Last year it made nearly a quarter of its sales from women's apparel. Combined with men's apparel and accessories, it made nearly half."

Trump kicked off a 12-day Asian trip and is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests.

He told reporters on Air Force One en route to Asia that North Korea would figure prominently in discussions during the trip. He also singled out trade, which he said had been ""badly handled"" in the region for years.

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it threatens the United States and his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a ""rocket man"" on a suicide mission.

A top aide said last week Trump intends to tell Asian leaders the world is ""running out of time"" in dealing with the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula.

""No dictator, no regime, no nation should ever underestimate American resolve,"" Trump told hundreds of cheering U.S. and Japanese troops in camouflage uniforms gathered at Yokota Air

Base, just west of Tokyo, soon after he arrived.

""Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us.

It was not pleasant for them, was it?"" said Trump, who wore a bomber jacket as he addressed the troops.

North Korea's recent actions, including several missiles that flew over Japan and Pyongyang's sixth and largest nuclear test, have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump's presidency.

Recent drills over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have further heightened tensions.

""We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defense of our freedom,"" Trump said.

He told reporters earlier on Air Force One that a decision would be made soon on whether to add reclusive North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Trump said his administration planned to take a different approach after years of what he termed ""total weakness.""

""We want to get it solved. It's a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved.""

In an apparent attempt to distinguish between North Korea's leadership and ordinary people, he said he thought North Koreans were ""great people.""

""And I hope it all works out for everybody."""

The S&P 500 Index just posted its longest weekly winning streak in four years, putting together eight straight weeks of gains. But a key test could come when one group of stocks reports earnings next week.

""I think you have to watch the retail sector from Black Friday on to the end of the year,"" Phil Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Friday.

Retail stocks are currently down 9 percent year to date, under massive industry pressure that's made company earnings misses resemble the dark days of the Great Recession.

Streible says that depending on the numbers from Black Friday, investors may want to start looking at far-dated put options to protect themselves, as the market could soon pull back.

""This looks like a party that never ends, but once it is, they'll be left in tears,"" he said.

But Kevin Caron, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, doesn't see the market rally ending anytime soon.

The two carriers have been huddled for weeks, but reports suggested talks hit several hurdles. In what was seen as a last-ditch bid to salvage a merger, both sides came together this weekend.

If consummated, a Sprint-T-Mobile deal would have created a mobile behemoth of more than 100 million subscribers, and put them within reach of Verizon and AT&T, the industry's top dogs. T-Mobile and Sprint are the U.S.' third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, respectively, but they are significantly smaller than AT&T and Verizon.

""The prospect of combining with Sprint has been compelling for a variety of reasons, including the potential to create significant benefits for consumers and value for shareholders,"" said John Legere, President and CEO of T-Mobile U.S., in a statement.

""However, we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile's shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record,"" he added.

Last week, reports surfaced that SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that controls Sprint, was planning to end talks with T-Mobile, whose parent is Deutsche Telekom.

""While we couldn't reach an agreement to combine our companies, we certainly recognize the benefits of scale through a potential combination. However, we have agreed that it is best to move forward on our own,"" Sprint president and CEO and Softbank Board member Marcelo Claure said.

But the missile was intercepted over northeast Riyadh, the Saudi Ministry of Defense said in a statement carried on government-backed Al-Arabiya television.

Yemen's Defense Ministry said the missile attack ""shook the Saudi capital"" and the operation was successful. The attack was conducted using a Yemeni-made, long-range missile called the Burqan 2H, it said.

The Riyadh airport tweeted that it hadn't been affected.

""Travelers across King Khalid international airport in Riyadh, we assure you that the movement is going on as normal and usual, and trips going according to time,"" the airport said on Twitter.

Airstrikes later in the day targeted Yemen's capital Sanaa, shaking homes and breaking windows. This is the first night attack on Sanaa in weeks, according to CNN's Hakim al-Masmari from Sanaa.

Saudi Arabia has been leading a coalition of states against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who toppled Yemen's internationally recognized government in 2015.

The missile launch on King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh was the first time the heart of the Saudi capital has been attacked and represents a major escalation of the ongoing war in the region.

No injuries

The Saudi-led coalition accused a regional state of providing material support to the Houthi rebels, saying the firing of a ballistic missile at Riyadh ""threatens the security of the Kingdom and regional and international security,"" according to a statement carried by Saudi state-TV al-Ekbariya.

The coalition didn't name the country. Saudi Arabia has been fighting a proxy war in Yemen against Iran, which it accuses of arming the Houthi rebels. Saudi Arabia has led a military operation in Yemen in support of the internationally recognized government, which was driven out of the capital by the Shiite Houthi rebels and is now based in the southern city of Aden.

""This hostile and random act by the Houthis proves that one of the terrorism-supporting countries in the region supports the Houthis,"" the statement said.

The missile was fired at 8:07 p.m. local time (1:07 p.m. ET) and targeted civilian areas in Riyadh, the coalition said. It was intercepted by the Patriot missile defense system, leading to shrapnel falling over an uninhabited area east of the airport, the statement said.

There were no injuries, it said.

US President Donald Trump praised the US-made Patriot missile defense system.

""We make the best military equipment in the world,"" he said. ""... You saw the missile that went out? And our system knocked the missile out of the air. That's how good we are. Nobody makes what we make, and now we're selling it all over the world,"" Trump told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One en route to Japan.

'New phase'

The UN Human Rights Office has documented 13,829 civilian casualties in Yemen, including 5,110 people killed, from the beginning of the fighting into late August.

An airstrike in Sanaa in August destroyed two residential buildings, which a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said was an ""unintentional accident."" An airstrike days earlier destroyed a hotel on the outskirts of Sanaa, leaving dozens dead.

""We previously warned that capitals of countries attacking Yemen will not be safe from our ballistic missiles,"" Houthi spokesman Mohammed AbdulSalam said. ""Today's missile attack comes in response to Saudi killing innocent Yemeni civilians.""

A senior Yemeni air force official told CNN that the claim that Saudi Arabia intercepted the ballistic missile is false.

""The Saudi regime cannot hide the heavy fires that was seen by thousands of Saudi nationals in the King Khalid Airport premises as result of the Yemeni missile,"" the official said.

""This is not the end. Saudi cities will be a continuous target. We are entering a new phase,"" he said."

In a televised address from Riyadh,Hariri said he feared an assassination plot and accused Iran of meddling in the region, causing ""devastation and chaos.""

""Iran controls the region and the decision-making in both Syria and Iraq,"" he said. ""I want to tell Iran and its followers that it will lose in its interventions in the internal affairs of Arab countries.""

Iran dismissed the reports, accusing the United States and Saudi Arabia of orchestrating the resignation.

""Hariri's resignation was coordinated with US President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia's Mohammad bin Salman ,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry official Hossein Sheikholeslam told the semiofficial Fars News Agency.

""The resignation was aimed at creating tension in Lebanon and the region. This resignation was also meant to compensate the US for its failures after the defeat of the Daesh (ISIS).""

In his speech, Hariri, a Sunni politician, also pointed to Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed Shiite militant group in Lebanon.

""Over the past decades, Hezbollah has unfortunately managed to impose a fait accompli in Lebanon by the force of its weapons, which it alleges is a resistance weapon,"" Hariri said.

""Lebanon and the great Lebanese people became in the eye of the storm and subjected to international condemnations and economic sanctions because of Iran and its arm Hezbollah.""

While the United States considers Hezbollah a terrorist group, its political wing is the most powerful bloc in Lebanon's deeply divided coalition government, and several of its politicians are ministers.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun, a Christian who's affiliated with Hezbollah, confirmed he had received a phone call from Hariri about stepping down.

Aoun's office said he would wait for the Prime Minister to return to Beirut to discuss the circumstances of his resignation.

Climate of fear

In his speech in the Saudi capital, Hariri said the atmosphere in Lebanon was similar to the one that existed 12 years ago right before the assassination of his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri

Portrait of slain ex-Prime Minister Rafik Hariri is displayed near his gravesite.

""We live in an atmosphere similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and I sensed what is being woven in secret to target my life,"" he said.

Hariri's father was assassinated in February 2005 when a bomb struck his motorcade near the Beirut seafront.

A special UN-backed court is trying alleged associates of Hezbollah in absentia in his killing. Hezbollah denies involvement.

The assassination was a pivotal event in Lebanon, further fueling the sectarian divisions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. The Mediterranean country has a large Christian population as well.

The death also led to the withdrawal of Syrian troops, deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005. They first came as peacekeepers to help stop Lebanon's civil war but remained long after the fighting stopped in 1990. Syria has dominated Lebanon's political scene for much of its post-independence history.

Analyst: Saudi Arabia is 'primary driver'

The longstanding animosity between two regional powerhouses -- Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shiite Iran -- was a major factor in Saturday's developments, said Randa Slim, director of a conflict resolution program at the Middle East Institute in Washington.

""I think the primary driver for this resignation is Saudi Arabia,"" Slim told CNN. ""It indicates the Saudi decision to confront Iran and the Iranian influence in Lebanon by going after Hezbollah.""

The fact that Hariri's announcement was made in Riyadh was an important clue, she said. She also noted Hariri holds dual citizenship in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.

""By going after Hezbollah, by denying Hezbollah a credible Sunni partner in governance, it thus weakens Hezbollah on the home front,"" Slim said.

Hariri's second stint as Prime Minister

Lebanese President Aoun asked Hariri to become Prime Minister last year. He headed a national unity Cabinet that included Hezbollah.

It marked Hariri's second stint as Prime Minister. Hariri first took office in June 2009. Less than two years later, 11 Hezbollah members of his Cabinet resigned, causing a coalition government to collapse.

Under the Lebanese Constitution , the president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of the Parliament a Shiite Muslim.

"Kevin Liptak and Jeremy Diamond, CNN",President Donald Trump touched down in Japan late Saturday ahead of a 13-day trek through Asia that he hopes will divert from a bruising political controversy back home.,2017-11-05T06:28:20Z,cnn,"Trump arrives in Japan, first in five-country Asian tour",http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/04/politics/trump-tokyo-asia-trip-shinzo-abe/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171103111624-trump-in-asia-preview-super-tease.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Tokyo (CNN) President Donald Trump touched down in Japan late Saturday ahead of a 13-day trek through Asia that he hopes will divert from a bruising political controversy back home.

Trump avoided the incendiary, bellicose rhetoric that has often defined his public remarks about the North Korean threat in his first remarks of his five-nation tour.

But in his first official remarks in the region, at a joint US-Japanese military base just outside of Tokyo, Trump sent a clear message to North Korea and the rest of the region that American military might and strong US alliances in the region remain a critical deterrent.

""Our brave warriors are the last bulwark against threats to the dreams of people in America and Japan and all across the world,"" Trump said. ""You are the greatest hope for people who desire to live in freedom and harmony and you are the greatest threat to tyrants and dictators who seek to prey on the innocent.""

Trading in his suit jacket for a flight jacket moments after taking the stage at Yokota Air Base, Trump praised the US-Japan military alliance, thanked US troops for keeping ""us all safe"" and talked up US military prowess in the region.

The remarks served to help set the tone for the President's Asian tour that will take him next to South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines for nearly two weeks of powerhouse diplomacy, much of which will focus on rallying other regional powers to step up their efforts to pressure North Korea into abandoning its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

Trump's remarks were devoid the kinds of direct threats he has previously aimed at the North Korean regime, with the President instead choosing to focus on the US-Japanese alliance and the peaceful aims of US military might in the region.

""You put hope in every soul that yearns for peace,"" Trump told the assembled troops.

Air Force One landed at the US-controlled Yokota Air Base outside Tokyo at about 9:37 p.m. ET Saturday (10:37 a.m. Sunday local time). Trump is due to address American servicemen and women stationed at the facility before beginning his official visit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

On his first swing through a continent gripped with tension over a nuclear standoff on its eastern edge, Trump will carry out high-stakes talks with the leaders of Japan, South Korea, and China, and attend days of summits in Vietnam and the Philippines.

Before arriving in Japan, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he expects to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hopes to enlist his help in changing North Korea's behavior. He will likely meet with Putin on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam.

""I think it's expected that we'll meet. We want Putin's help on North Korea,"" he told reporters. Trump had previously said a meeting with Putin was possible.

It's a slog of a presidential trip, one that became longer this week after Trump announced he would spend an extra day in Manila to attend the East Asia Summit. The last US President to spend this long in Asia was George H.W. Bush in 1992 -- and he ended the trip by vomiting in the Japanese prime minister's lap.

On the eight-hour flight from Hawaii, however, Trump dismissed concerns about the length of his trip.

""It is grueling, they tell me. But fortunately, historically that has not been a problem for me,"" Trump said. ""I'll let you know if I don't stay fresh. If I don't stay fresh, you'll be the first to tell me.""

At his first stop here in Tokyo, Trump is due to enjoy a round of golf and a steak dinner with Abe -- one of his closest foreign counterparts -- before sitting down for formal talks. The two men are expected to confer about North Korea, an area where they are largely in alignment. Abe hopes to adopt a tougher military stance against Pyongyang, altering a decades-long pacifist approach.

The two are also expected to discuss trade, though they don't see eye-to-eye on the issue. Trump has withdrawn the US from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a decision the Abe has criticized.

Hopes on the line

Escaping scandal fever in Washington after indictments of his campaign associates, Trump hopes an authoritative tour through five Asian capitals can help him rise above the controversy. But officials here, and even some of Trump's own aides, worry the Russia cloud could lead the unpredictable and bombastic US leader to lash out.

As he flew from Washington to an overnight stop in Hawaii, Trump demonstrated the Russia probe was still not far from mind, unleashing a flow of invective on Twitter accusing his own Justice Department of ignoring possible collusion by his former Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

It was an inauspicious start to a trip meant to consolidate support in Asia for his combative approach to North Korea and to lay out an assertive approach to negotiate trade agreements.

On his longest foreign swing to date, Trump hopes to convince Asian leaders to put up a united front against Pyongyang, which has scaled up its provocations since Trump took office.

The friendliest stop is likely to be the first here in Japan, where Trump finds a leader eager to fuel a budding friendship. South Korea's new leader has shown more of a willingness to break with the US President, chastising some of his bellicose rhetoric about North Korea while encouraging talks with Pyongyang.

China

And while he's developed friendly ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping , their talks are fraught after Trump lambasted China ceaselessly on the campaign trail for its trade practices. So far, though, he hasn't taken action to label Beijing a currency manipulator.

At a moment of political weakness amid the Russia investigation, he faces leaders who themselves are enjoying new political muscle. In Japan, Abe saw decisive wins for his party in snap elections last month, and Xi emerged from a critical Communist Party Congress having consolidated power in historic fashion.

That's left Trump anxious about his negotiating power as the FBI and congressional investigators continue probing his campaign's ties to Russia. While Trump is abroad, the office led by special counsel Robert Mueller is expected to interview key White House aides as part of its investigation.

While Trump may divert attention through his high-level diplomacy, the issue is likely to arise in dramatic fashion in Vietnam, where he will likely face Putin for only the second time face-to-face."

Leaving little down time to adjust to the 14-hour time difference from Washington, the first lady is hitting the ground running with a packed schedule of events with her husband and on her own.

With the first lady's multi-stop tour of Asia comes the tradition of meeting her counterparts; this week, she will be hosted by Akie Abe, wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, South Korean first lady Kim Jung-sook, wife of President Moon Jae-in, and Madame Peng Liyuan, wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump has hosted each woman in the United States, and now it's her turn to be welcomed.

On the way to Asia. I am looking forward to seeing Mrs. Abe 🇯🇵, First Lady Kim 🇰🇷 and Madame Peng 🇨🇳 again! #FLOTUSinAsia

Trump was ""very much looking forward"" to seeing Mrs. Abe again, the first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, told CNN.

The two women visited visit to Mikimoto Ginza Main Store in Tokyo, a luxury brand with a deep history steeped in Japanese culture. The two greeted each other warmly and then headed to a small room where they had a private tea.

Following their tea, Trump and Abe participated in a ""pearl seminar,"" viewing the different stages of pearl production, learning about the process from two Mikimoto pearl divers. Kokichi Mikimoto was the first person in the world to culture a semi-spherical pearl in 1893 on the island of Ojima, now known as Mikimoto Pearl Island, according to Mikimoto's website

Following the seminar, the two women participated in a photo in front of a staircase in what appeared to be the main lobby area of the store. They were then joined for a group photo with Mikimoto senior staff and the two divers, who were clad in what appeared to be an all-white dive suit with a red face mask.

On Monday, the two will tour an elementary school together and have lunch before a state dinner in the evening with their husbands.

Abe-Trump friendship

Abe was the first spouse of a foreign leader to visit the United States during the Trump administration. But with Melania Trump living in New York City during the first months of her husband's presidency, Abe rolled solo while she was in Washington in February , making stops at Gallaudet University and a National Cherry Blossom Festival committee meeting at the Japanese embassy.

""The first lady was very much looking forward to welcoming Mrs. Abe to the White House upon her arrival in Washington; however, she was informed that Mrs. Abe had previous commitments during her stay in DC,"" a statement from the first lady's office said at the time.

But that weekend, the two got together, traveling to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, with their husbands.

It was clear the women were beginning to build a warm rapport during their visit, feeding koi fish at the garden's pond and laughing delightedly together before returning to Mar-a-Lago for a private lunch together.

That evening, they dressed up for a dinner with their husbands, who, following that meal, delivered statements at a hastily convened joint news conference on North Korea's ballistic missile launch

'I live my own life'

Former first lady Laura Bush was also a hostess to Abe, the two visiting George Washington's Mount Vernon in Virginia.

First lady Laura Bush, and Akie Abe, wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, tour Mount Vernon estate.

Abe, once a disc jockey, is the daughter of a chocolate executive and now owns her own organic izakaya restaurant. She is known in Japan for having a mind of her own, sometimes publicly contradicting her husband.

Abe is ""popularly known as kateinai yatō (at-home opposition party)"" and has openly disagreed with the Prime Minister on issues such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, nuclear power, and the construction of seawalls on part of Japan's coast, according to the Japan Times . Her 2007 book was called ""Watashi wo Ikiru"" -- translation, according to the Japan Times, ""I live my own life.""

While Trump's views on controversial issues may be more mysterious, she has also made an effort to separate herself from her husband. Trump has defined combating school bullying as a key aspect of her platform as first lady, which has prompted criticism over the President's Twitter behavior

Asked by CNN if the first lady feels the need to reconcile that irony with what she's trying to accomplish, East Wing spokeswoman Grisham said flatly, ""no.""

""Mrs. Trump is independent and acts independently from her husband,"" Grisham told CNN at the time. ""She does what she feels is right and knows that she has a real opportunity through her role as first lady to have a positive impact on the lives of children. Her only focus is to effect change within our next generation."""
"Jeremy Diamond and Stephen Collinson, CNN","Donald Trump's national security adviser issued a stark warning the day before the President left Washington for a critical swing through Asia: ""We're running out of time.""",2017-11-04T13:32:58Z,cnn,Trump begins high-stakes Asian diplomacy tour,http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/04/politics/donald-trump-china-north-korea/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170831090611-kim-jong-un-and-trump-tease-super-tease.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"(CNN) Donald Trump's national security adviser issued a stark warning the day before the President left Washington for a critical swing through Asia: ""We're running out of time.""

The risk of military confrontation with North Korea appears to only grow by the week. North Korea is quietly, but aggressively, working to advance its intercontinental ballistic missile program to reach the United States with a nuclear warhead. And while the US, its allies and even its adversaries agree more must be done -- and quickly -- there is no clear consensus on how to proceed.

That sobering backdrop makes Trump's 13-day trip through the region -- where he will meet with key players and get a firsthand view of the North Korean nuclear threat -- the United States' best chance to stave off a crisis that is threatening to embroil the US in its first major war in Asia since the Vietnam War.

While there is little expectation that Trump will return to Washington having cracked the code to stopping North Korea's advance, he is under considerable pressure to deliver a clear and consistent message on the US approach to the North Korean crisis. He needs to rally US allies and intends to crank up more pressure on China to change its isolated neighbor's course.

And, as Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster warned, the clock is ticking. CNN learned earlier this week that North Korea is working on an advanced version of its existing KN-20 intercontinental ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the United States, and it is entirely possible that next year, Pyongyang could master the technology to tip such a missile with a miniaturized warhead.

That means that the current visit could be the last trip by a US president to see the region's leaders face to face before that fateful threshold is crossed.

What's the US strategy?

For now, the President has often left the region befuddled about the US strategy to resolving the crisis. Is that approach best exemplified by his explosive rhetoric threatening ""fire and fury""? Or is it rooted in the quiet, cautious diplomacy embodied by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and supported by Defense Secretary James Mattis?

""It is important the President ... bring forth a clear message that is not contradicted by his Cabinet members. You've got Tillerson talking diplomacy, you've got the President talking military action and personal insults,"" said Bill Richardson, the former US energy secretary, ambassador and repeat US envoy to North Korea. ""And he has to get a common strategy among our allies. We're divided.""

And yet just as Trump's most crucial task will be to express the United States' stance clearly, cogently and without contradiction, it is Trump's penchant for impulsive and bellicose rhetoric that is leaving the region most on edge.

Trump is touching down on the heels of a salvo of anti-North Korea sanctions and other pressure tactics that have earned his administration plaudits from US allies in the region. Former US officials and regional experts agree that the administration has delivered the furthest-reaching sanctions yet and needled China toward its most significant actions against North Korea to date.

But those who praise his administration's work to beef up the diplomatic pressure campaign are just as quick to criticize Trump for the ways in which he has undermined those efforts -- and they worry the President could similarly undermine the careful choreography and delicate diplomacy prepared by his own advisers with the stroke of a tweet or an off-script comment while in the region.

Joseph DeThomas, a 30-year veteran of the US Foreign Service and expert in nuclear nonproliferation said he believes the Trump administration has ""done very well at increasing the pressure on North Korea,"" but said he worries Trump's visit to the region could leave the US efforts worse off.

""It's the first time in my life -- having served every president since Jimmy Carter -- that I'm saying, 'Oh, please don't let the President go,' "" DeThomas said. ""I don't see a lot of good coming out of this and I see lots of risk of an unfiltered comment generating lots of consequences.""

Allies on edge

JUST WATCHED Trump to UN: 'Rocket Man' on a suicide mission Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump to UN: 'Rocket Man' on a suicide mission 02:23

Trump's past comments have already put US allies on edge.

He has publicly scorned his secretary of state's efforts to open diplomatic channels with North Korea, threatened North Korea with hostile rhetoric and left diplomats stunned by calling Kim Jong Un ""Rocket Man"" in a United Nations speech where he also threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea.

The stakes are even higher as Trump will spend his first three stops in Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing, less than 1,000 miles from Pyongyang -- where his threats could have a much more serious impact.

Richardson, a sometime-envoy to North Korea, recalled officials there being ""really upset"" after President George W. Bush privately disparaged the country's then-leader Kim Jong Il as a ""pygmy.""

""The worst thing you can do is insult them,"" Richardson said.

The analysis -- though echoed in near-unison across the political spectrum -- is rejected by the White House, which signaled ahead of the trip that Trump has no plans to cool his rhetoric.

""I don't think the President really modulates his language. Have you noticed him do that?"" McMaster, Trump's national security adviser, said Thursday. ""What's inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what they're doing to threaten the world.""

""I think there would be a grave danger if that regime didn't understand our resolve, the President's resolve to counter North Korean aggression,"" he added.

But instead of threats, experts hope Trump will focus on putting forward a united front between the US and its key allies in the region, Japan and South Korea.

""He needs to hold our allies close, and that in particular means South Korea,"" said Christopher Hill, who frequently negotiated with North Korean officials as the former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and is a former US ambassador to South Korea.

Hill and others worry that Trump will once again accuse Seoul -- where millions already live within reach of North Korea's nuclear arsenal -- of ""appeasement"" or again raise the possibility of terminating the bilateral free trade agreement between the two countries, known as KORUS, which could weaken ties between the two countries at a critical juncture.

Trump in China

But the President's most crucial visit will be to China, which the Trump administration believes holds the key to convincing Kim to give up his ballistic missile and nuclear programs.

""China is definitely doing more, but obviously it's not enough, until all of us achieve denuclearization,"" McMaster told reporters on Thursday, a nod to the US desire for China to further tighten the noose on North Korea, especially when it comes to energy sanctions.

While China -- which accounts for 90% of North Korea's foreign trade -- could take further steps to weaken its neighbor economically, many China analysts believe that Beijing's leverage over Pyongyang is not as significant as Washington thinks, given that Kim appears to believe that the only way his regime will survive is the acquisition of the capability to deliver a nuclear weapon to the US mainland.

And ultimately, China's own strategic interests -- in preventing the collapse of North Korea, and a united Korea that might ally itself to the US -- may outweigh its incentive to help the Trump administration out of a tight spot.

""This is something in which it's hard to see where this is going -- will this push the Chinese to resolve a problem that the US expects it to help resolve?"" said Leland Miller, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""I think the answer to that is unfortunately, no."""

""If one presidential candidate can disassemble a political party, it speaks volumes about how strong a legacy its past two presidents really had,"" a White House official told CNN. ""And that begins with the Iraq war, one of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in American history.""

""President Trump remains focused on keeping his promises to the American people by bringing back jobs, promoting an 'America First' foreign policy and standing up for the forgotten men and women of our great county,"" the official said.

Former President George H.W. Bush delivered a blunt assessment of Trump in historian Mark Updegrove's new book, titled ""The Last Republicans,"" saying, ""He's a blowhard."" And former President George W. Bush also had harsh words for his Republican successor: ""This guy doesn't know what it means to be president.""

En route to Tokyo on Saturday, Trump was more restrained when asked for reaction to the Bushes' comments. ""I'll comment after we come back. I don't need headlines. I don't want to make their move successful,"" he said.

This is the first time the former presidents are speaking out about Trump in such stark terms. Both men went on the record to give Updegrove their candid assessment of Trump, as well as rare insight into their thoughts on the 2016 presidential race as the drama unfolded.

The most critical comments about Trump came from the elder Bush, now 93, who told Updegrove in May 2016, ""I don't like him. I don't know much about him, but I know he's a blowhard. And I'm not too excited about him being a leader.""

The author went on to ask George H.W. Bush what he thought Trump was seeking in running for president, and the former Navy war hero responded by saying that Trump had ""a certain ego."" Though George H.W. Bush told the author he thought Trump could unite the country, he said it would require ""humility,"" which the former President told Updegrove was a challenge for Trump.

In commenting about the Bushes' remarks, Updegrove told CNN's Jamie Gangel: ""If you look at the Bush family, it makes perfect sense. Donald Trump is everything that the Bush family is not.""

""George Bush grew up thinking about the greater good. Donald Trump is manifestly narcissistic. It's part of his brand. And that brand is the antithesis of the Bush brand,"" Updegrove added.

George W. Bush echoed his father's sentiments when he told Updegrove, ""As you know from looking at my family, (humility) is a certain heritage. That's what they expect, and we're not seeing that (in Trump).""

Updegrove told CNN: ""When Donald Trump said, 'I am my own adviser,' Bush thought -- and this is a quote -- 'Wow, this guy doesn't know what it means to be president.'""

In the book, Updegrove writes that the younger Bush did not think Trump would win when he first entered the presidential race. ""Interesting, won't last"" was the reaction that George W. Bush had in those days, Updegrove writes. And he added that the younger Bush was surprised when Trump emerged as the Republican Party nominee. ""When you're not out there and you're not with the people, you don't get a good sense of (the mood),'"" George W. Bush told Updegrove.

CNN has reached out to both former presidents' offices and they both confirmed that they had spoken with Updegrove on the record, but as a policy do not comment on books.

On Hillary Clinton

In the end, neither Bush voted for their party's nominee. George H.W. Bush confirmed that he voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. George W. Bush told Updegrove he left the top of the ballot blank.

""I voted 'None of the Above' for president, and Republican down ballot in 2016,"" he said.

He went on to say that concern with the former secretary of state's judgment kept him from following his father's lead. He told the author in the weeks leading up to Election Day, ""The question for the country to decide -- on both candidates, by the way -- is to what extent should we be insisting upon integrity and solid character.""

George W. Bush described his relationship with Clinton, according to Updegrove, saying: ""'In my presence, she was polite ... thoughtful,"" he said, but alluding to her using a private email server as secretary of state, he added, ""obviously tangled up in bad judgment. This email thing, putting confidential information out there in a world where all kinds of people can figure out how to get your emails was not good judgment.""

In the end, the younger Bush concluded it was ""a strange election year,"" and told Updegrove both candidates were ""among the few in the country"" who made each other ""viable.""

'Prodigal son'

The book includes other blunt comments by George W. Bush, including his reaction to stories about his rebellious youth and the perception that his vice president, Dick Cheney, exercised too much power.

In the first chapter, George W. Bush calls the notion that he was the ""prodigal son,"" a reference to a wayward son in the Bible, ""bullshit."" And in a 2012 interview with Updegrove, Bush told the historian he ""chased a lot of pussy and drank a lot of whiskey"" as a young man, but added, ""I was never the prodigal son because I never left my family.""

The author told CNN he concluded that though Bush was rowdy in his younger years and his antics rose ""to the level of sophomoric hijinks that might be the basis of fraternity lore,"" his rebelliousness has been greatly exaggerated.

This isn't the only notion Bush tries to dispel. When asked about the power and influence of former vice president Cheney and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in his administration, George W. Bush replied that Cheney and Rumsfeld ""didn't make one fucking decision.""

Discussing that quote, Updegrove told CNN, ""I understand his frustration, because at the time there was the perception that Dick Cheney was the acting president. That Cheney was sort of a Machiavellian puppet master. But, in fact, George W. Bush had had a lifetime of making bold decisions. He has this natural confidence in himself as a leader. And if you talk to those around him, they have confidence in his leadership. And so, this notion that Cheney was making the decisions is ludicrous.""

Father and son

The relationship between father and son is what drove Updegrove, who is a historian and former director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library, to write ""The Last Republicans.""

""There are so many misconceptions about this relationship,"" the author told CNN. ""You have to get the story right, and I felt in order to do that, you had to talk to the principles themselves."" Updegrove spoke with both former presidents several times in the past few years in order to delve into their personal connection, which he repeatedly described as ""very close.""

Even so, the author said that George H.W. Bush was careful not to interfere when his son became President. ""Because he understands what it is to be president, and he doesn't want to be a burden to his son,"" Updegrove told CNN. ""So what he is, instead, is a comforter in chief. He's there for his son to be a loving presence in his life. That's what he considers his most important role.""

The bottom line: Updegrove calls the relationship between the first father-son presidential duo in more than 150 years ""a complicated love story, but a love story nonetheless.""

The title

As for ""The Last Republicans,"" Updegrove said the idea came from a comment George W. Bush made after last year's election.

""George W. Bush himself said in 2016 privately, and then to me, that 'you know, I fear that I will be the last Republican president.' And it wasn't just about Hillary Clinton becoming president, as the Republican Party was having a difficult time finding itself. It was because Donald Trump represented everything that the Bushes abhorred,"" the author told CNN.

When asked his thoughts on George W. Bush's fear, Updegrove told CNN, ""There's no question that I think there's a battle for the soul of the Republican Party. And the Republicans have to figure out who they are, and what they stand for.""

""The Last Republicans"" goes on sale on November 14."

The Met Office is briefing transport bosses, councils and the government in the face of a big freeze that has caused bookies to put the odds of a white Christmas at 2/1.

The north of England is expected to be hit by snow from Tuesday in a week-long chill that forecasters put down to the eastern Pacific Ocean's cooling, also known as La Nina.

Rainy autumn weather in London risk dampening the plans of those celebrating Bonfire Night a day early

Hampshire has managed to remain windy but dry, dodging the drizzle that has spread across the capital

The country is facing a repeat of La Nina's 2010 chills when November experienced -13C lows, 15 inches of snow in the north and seven inches in the south.

A Met Office spokesperson said Pacific cooling means 'colder-than-normal conditions' are a significant possibility over the next few months.

For those celebrating Bonfire Night a day early, celebrations across the country tonight will be dampened by heavy rain, hail and thunder, and for all it will be a chilly evening, so woollies and wet weather gear will be essential, according to forecasters.

But some areas have managed to dodge the drizzle, as Hampshire remains windy but dry.

Following unsettled overnight weather, drier and colder conditions will move in with a slight frost possible in the east and south of England.

But in the west of the country, from Devon and Cornwall through Wales and north-west England, there is the chance of heavy showers. Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘It’s going to be cold everywhere tonight so people going to bonfire parties should wrap up warm.

Flood alerts have been issued for West Bay on the Dorset coast, which is expecting high tides.

‘Areas in the east will be generally clear and cold, with temperatures down in the low single figures and, in some places, a degree or two below freezing.

‘In the western half, there will be heavy showers which could include hail and thunder, and cold winds which could make it feel as cold as in the east.’

Mr Powell said tomorrow will generally be drier and brighter across the country, although isolated showers are possible. Temperatures could fall as low as -4C (25F) tomorrow night across England and Wales, and -6C (21F) in Scotland.

An 80-year-old tradition of white residents in Lewes, East Sussex, ‘blacking up’ as spear-carrying Zulu warriors for a big Bonfire Night parade has been scrapped after it was branded ‘incredibly offensive’.

Weather forecasters claim this weekend's festivities could be hit by bad weather

More than 1,200 people signed a petition branding the tradition racist and the Lewes Borough Bonfire Society has agreed to alter its costumes for tonight’s event after a Zulu dance troupe taking part took offence.

Thanda Gumede, 32, leader of the group Zulu Tradition, sent messages to a member of the society asking them to consider ‘using a different colour that is drastically different from black – perhaps “green up” or other bright colours?’

The organisers have agreed to take the advice, but after the row erupted over the petition earlier in the week, society chairman Jason Winter said: ‘It’s a lot of white do-gooders jumping on a bandwagon.’"

He is pictured outside his home in West London earlier this week

The Deputy Prime Minister has been hit with a fresh scandal amid claims that police found 'extreme' pornography on his computer.

Officers claim they unearthed the X-rated material while raiding Damian Green's parliamentary office during an inquiry into government leaks.

But Bob Quick, a former assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police, says he was forced to step down before he had a chance to report the pornography to parliamentary authorities.

His resignation came after he was pictured carrying sensitive anti-terror documents into Downing Street in 2009.

Mr Quick is said to have revealed the existence of the alleged material in a draft statement to the Leveson Inquiry about the 2008 raids.

It was never read out during the proceedings in 2011 and 2012 meaning that the allegations are only now coming to light.

Mr Green is already facing a Cabinet Office inquiry - which will now hear evidence from Mr Quick on Monday - after a Tory activist claimed he had touched her knee.

Kate Maltby accused him of making a clumsy pass and sending her a 'suggestive' text message.

The 31-year-old has claimed that Mr Green 'put a fleeting hand against my knee' while they were talking in a bar.

The First Secretary of State vehemently denies any wrongdoing, and has made clear he is prepared to release a cache of 'friendly' text messages to an official Cabinet Office inquiry in a bid to show there was nothing untoward.

A friend of Mr Green, 61, told the Telegraph there were other explanations for the alleged contact with Ms Maltby's knee.

'She claims it is a fleeting touch. But that could have been a tablecloth,' the friend said.

Mr Green is understood to have instructed libel lawyers to assess the possibility of a defamation claim against Miss Maltby, whose parents are family friends.

Hitting back at today's claims, Mr Green said in a statement: 'This story is completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source.

'I've been aware for some years that the discredited former assistant commissioner Bob Quick has tried to cause me political damage by leaking false information about the raid on my parliamentary office.

'No newspaper has reported this story due to the complete lack of any evidence.

'The police have never suggested to me that inappropriate material was found on my Parliamentary computer.

'Nor did I have a 'private' computer, as has been claimed. The allegations about the material and the computer, now nine years old, are false.

'They amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination.'"

And followers of Ahmadiyya, a branch of Islam favouring integration, say they have been abused for their efforts, branded ‘infidels’ by other Muslims and ‘traitors’ by Left-wing critics for selling poppies.

Last year, Ahmadiyya members – who are not recognised by mainstream Islam – raised more than £100,000 at stations and on high streets, and this year are aiming for a record £250,000 as they field more than 400 sellers.

But they are acutely aware of the negativity surrounding Remembrance Day as a chorus of Left-wing critics such as writer Robert Fisk denounce the poppy as ‘racist’.

Naveed Uz Zafar (right, with fellow Muslim poppy sellers) told The Mail on Sunday how he was harangued last week by an angry, white Left-winger in a crowded station who claimed that selling the poppy was a betrayal of Palestinians – until he was shouted down by passers-by

‘We have all heard the calls of “infidel” and the suggestion that poppies are somehow racist,’ said Dr Ijaz Rehman, a leader of the movement, which has 30,000 followers across the UK.

‘But it’s rubbish. Our motto is “Love for all, hatred for none”,’ said Dr Rehman, president of the Ahmadiyya Elders’ Association, ‘and as we live in this country, are protected by this country, then we are loyal to this country, as many of our ancestors were.

‘We draw a distinction between the political arguments about where an army might be fighting and supporting the soldiers and their families, which is what the Royal British Legion does and we are proud to help with.’

Veteran foreign correspondent and author Mr Fisk claims that the poppy is synonymous with the First and Second World Wars yet ignores hundreds of thousands of civilians killed in more recent campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Mr Uz Zafar, 53, whose uncle flew in the RAF, said: ‘Several of us were in Euston Station on Thursday and this man came up to loudly accuse us of betraying Muslims and Palestine.

'But then other people came over and told him we were doing something for our country and asked him what was he doing and he wandered off.

‘Then, as we were going down the Tube escalators carrying all our poppy paraphernalia, a man on the up escalator saluted us and about seven other people on that side all joined in. It was very moving.’"

Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service was called to the production plant of Arconic in Exeter just before 1.30am on Saturday.

The US firm produces the Reynobond PE panels, used as one component of the west London block's cladding system during a refurbishment.

It is suspected that the material, which is coated in aluminium but has a plastic, flammable core, helped fuel the blaze in June.

Crews rushed to the factory on Kestral Way following reports of a fire in the casting plant at its foundry section.

The fire service said: 'Due to the potential serious nature of this incident and knowledge of the type of building involved, fire control made the decision to redirect fire appliances from other lower priority incidents in the area to ensure fire service resources were in attendance as soon as possible.'

Eight fire engines were sent to tackle the blaze, which is said to have started accidentally, along with additional support vehicles.

By 2.30am, the fire had spread to part of the roof of the factory, but firefighters using breathing apparatus brought it under control and extinguished it before 3am.

The factory's furnace area was damaged by the fire and smoke, but no-one was injured.

The company said at the time of the Grenfell Tower fire that the panels were provided to a company which supplied them to the facade installer working on behalf of the contractor for the refurbishment. The burnt-out block is pictured (stock photo)

In June, Arconic announced it was stopping global sales of Reynobond PE cladding for tall buildings, citing concerns about the 'inconsistency of building codes across the world'.

It said in a separate statement that the panels were provided to a company which supplied them to the facade installer working on behalf of the contractor for Grenfell Tower's refurbishment.

The company wrote at the time: 'We were not involved in the installation of the system, nor did we have a role in any other aspect of the building's refurbishment or original design.'

It is understood that Reynobond panels were not produced at the the branch of Arconic affected by the blaze.

A spokesman said: 'There was a small fire at our Exeter facility this morning, which on-site and other safety personnel quickly contained.

'No one was hurt and the fire had a limited impact on the facility, which produces investment castings for aerospace and industrial use. The plant is back at full production.'"

Jack Letts, nicknamed Jihadi Jack after he travelled to Islamic State-controlled Raqqa in Syria in 2014, was captured by Kurdish PYD forces after he escaped from IS.

This newspaper disclosed last week that nothing has been heard of Letts, 21, since July 8, when he sent his parents, John and Sally, anguished messages from his prison cell in Syria.

His parents’ solicitor, Tayab Ali, last night revealed that besides suing the British Government, he will this week also file a criminal complaint against Kurdish officials at the PYD’s European office in Berlin.

John and Sally Letts (above), the parents of a middle-class Muslim convert from Oxford who claims he has been tortured by Kurdish militia, plan to sue the Foreign Office in a bid to force the Government to bring their son home

He will allege that, by defending Letts’s treatment and unlawful detention, they are complicit – a crime under German law. Both actions are being supported by the human rights charity Reprieve.

Letts insists that he did not fight for IS, and before his escape he publicly condemned them – for which, he says, he was detained in the terror group’s jails.

The basis for the case against the Foreign Office is the claim in messages from Letts to his parents that his Kurdish interrogators had been supplied with questions by British officials, suggesting the UK knows where he is and who is holding him.

Mr Ali wrote on Friday asking the Foreign Office to intervene with the PYD to obtain Letts’s release.

This newspaper disclosed last week that nothing has been heard of Letts, 21, since July 8, when he sent his parents anguished messages from his prison cell in Syria

He stated that it should also ‘make representations that under no circumstances should Jack Letts be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment… You will understand that sending questions while Jack is being subjected to torture may make UK agents complicit in that torture’.

Mr Ali told The Mail on Sunday that if his request is refused, he will file a High Court judicial review – on the grounds the Government is failing in its duty to assist British citizens.

He said: ‘The PYD are our allies, and they have confirmed they have not even received a request to transfer Jack Letts to UK custody. There can be no adequate reason for refusing even to ask for him to be handed over.’

Last week, Sinam Mohamad, the PYD’s European representative, issued a statement denying Letts had been tortured.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said she had nothing to add to previous statements: the Government could do nothing while Letts was in Syria, because there is no UK consulate there."

But there is perhaps another reason for the delight on the face of the young Princess Elizabeth as, with Prince Philip, she leaves Buckingham Palace to embark upon their honeymoon, nearly 70 years ago.

For as Lady Pamela Hicks, a cousin of Philip, daughter of Earl Mountbatten and one of only two surviving bridesmaids, today recalls, the happy couple were accompanied by a secret but much loved guest.

The then Princess Elizabeth and Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten look happy as they make their way to Waterloo Station on November 20, 1947 for their honeymoon in Romsey

A Royal courtier 'smuggled' the then Princess Elizabeth's favourite Corgi Susan, left, into the carriage so the newly-married couple could bring the dog on their honeymoon

According to Lady Pamela Hicks, the Queen was 'delighted' to find her dog in the carriage

‘Princess Elizabeth was delighted to discover that Susan, her favourite corgi, had been hidden under a rug in her carriage so that she could join them for their honeymoon at Broadlands,’ recalled Lady Pamela, speaking as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh approach their Platinum wedding anniversary later this month.

‘Their departure was particularly poignant for me as Broadlands, in Hampshire, was our family home. I could only imagine the excitement of the staff as they awaited the Royal couple’s arrival. I went to bed that night too over-excited to sleep. It had been a fairytale wedding and, as a bridesmaid, I felt so thrilled to have played a small part in it.’

Lady Pamela, who was just 18 when she was asked to be a bridesmaid, recalled a grand reception and ball on the eve of the wedding ceremony, at which European kings and queens, many of whom hadn’t seen each other for years because of the Second World War, were reunited.

‘Crown Princess Juliana of the Netherlands caused a stir by remarking that everyone’s jewellery was so dirty,’ she said. ‘To me it was just remarkable that all those royal jewels had survived at all.

‘The next day was a frenzy of activity as we all got ready in Buckingham Palace. There were eight of us bridesmaids, and it took a small army of dressers to get us into our Norman Hartnell gowns of tulle and white satin.’

Lady Pamela Hicks, second left, is one of only two bridesmaids still alive

What came next was almost a comedy of errors. ‘People may imagine that big Royal events go like clockwork,’ Lady Pamela said. ‘They do not.

‘There was a moment of panic when, as the bride’s veil was being fitted, her tiara broke. An aide was bundled into a taxi and sent hurrying to the jeweller’s.

‘Then, just as the bride was about to leave, her bouquet could not be found. It had been popped in a cupboard to remain fresh – and forgotten. Yet throughout all this mayhem, the bride was totally unflustered. As ever.

‘Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip could not have been a more glamorous, stunning couple on their wedding day,’ Lady Pamela added. ‘She looked wonderful in her beautiful dress and veil and had an incredible peaches-and-cream complexion. She was 21, in love and radiantly happy.

According to Lady Pamela, Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip could not have been a more glamorous, stunning couple on their wedding day

‘Being one of the tallest, I was in the last pair of bridesmaids in the procession at Westminster Abbey. As we processed slowly up the aisle, I could see Cousin Philip standing with his best man, David Milford Haven, another of our cousins.

‘The bridegroom was so dashing that it made you realise why every girl in England seemed to think she was in love with him.’

Once the service was over, a fanfare of trumpets and a rousing organ voluntary accompanied the procession back down the aisle.

Lady Pamela added: ‘We followed the newly married couple through the ecstatic crowds back to the palace, closely followed by [Elizabeth’s father] the King and [her grandmother] Queen Mary and most of the royalty of Europe.

‘After the photography session was over, we accompanied the bride and groom on to the balcony.

‘We were met by an incredible sight: the police had been holding everyone back around the Victoria Memorial, but when we came out, they let them go and we could see – and hear – a sea of people surging forward.

‘Every time the newlyweds waved, the volume of cheering increased. We were later told that while they were waiting the crowd had been singing All The Nice Girls Love A Sailor!

‘It was one of the most memorable days of my life.’"

But the fraudster allegedly demanded £10,000 up front before dropping her case.

A source at Hurghada resort's prosecutor's office told The Sun: 'The tricksters conned the British lady and her family her when they were desperate for help.

'They promised her they would get her out of jail and fight the charges but demanded a down-payment of around £10,000.

'Egyptians wary of this kind of scam would never have parted with money until after a court hearing, but this lady was vulnerable and thought it was the right thing to do.'

The MailOnline has contacted her family for a comment.

It comes as her sister, Jayne Synclair, 40, said Ms Plummer is being held in a 15ft by 15ft cell with 'murderers, heroin addicts and prostitutes' and was being 'kicked and kicked' until the leader of the cell intervened.

Ms Plummer, 33, from Hull, claims she was forced to sign a 38-page Arabic confession before being locked in a tiny cell with dozens of other women

Ms Plummer, from Hull, brought the medicine into the country to give to her Egyptian boyfriend Omar, who suffers from severe back and arm pain after being in a car crash a few years ago.

But the drug, which is available in the UK on prescription, is banned in Egypt and sometimes used as a heroin substitute.

Ms Plummer has claimed she was forced to sign a 38-page Arabic confession before being locked in a tiny cell with dozens of other women.

Ms Synclair said her sister is 'naive and child-like' and 'didn't even check what the drugs were'.

Speaking to the Mirror, Ms Synclair said: 'Her life is in danger. We went out to see her last week and my mum collapsed at the sight of her. She looked over at us and said 'mum, mum, please help me, help me'. It was horrendous.

'We are quite a glamorous family and she looked absolutely shocking. Her hair has fallen out and she has a really bad ear infection which has caused her whole face and neck to swell.

'She can't stay in there any longer or she will be murdered or kill herself.'

Ms Plummer was arrested after flying in to a Red Sea beach resort for a break with Omar.

She claims she was recommended the pills - of which she was carrying 29 strips, each containing ten tablets which has a 'street value' of £23.20 - by a colleague when discussing Omar's consistent pain.

Her mother Roberta Synclair, 63, believes Mrs Plummer is being prosecuted for drug trafficking but told The Sun: 'She had no idea she was doing anything wrong.

'The painkillers were placed at the top of her suitcase, she wasn't hiding them.

Omar suffers from back problems, which Mrs Plummer claims was the reason she brought the tablets to Egypt

'We've been told she's facing either 25 years in prison or the death penalty. We're beside ourselves worrying that they'll make an example of her.

'She's gone through the worst pain imaginable - she's going through hell.

'I've been out twice to see her and going out again so I can see her on Thursday.'

Mrs Plummer was held for five hours at the airport with no interpreter.

She then signed a statement she believed would allow her to leave.

Drugs and the death penalty in Egypt In Egypt capital punishment is carried out by hanging. The state carried out at least 44 executions last year. Possession, use and trafficking illegal drugs can be punished with death. Carrying small amounts can result in lengthy prison sentences of 25 years. It is common for people convicted to life imprisonment in drugs cases to face life imprisonment with no chance of parole or pardon. In 2015 Cairo Scene reported that tramadol was the 'most abused drug in Egypt'. An anti-addiction hotline found that 40.7 per cent of drug users take the painkiller.

Mrs Plummer is said to still be wearing the same clothes she flew out in and was handcuffed to a gun-wielding policeman when she first appeared in court. She is due to appear in the dock again on Thursday.

Her mother claimed she looked 'dead behind the eyes' and repeatedly begged for help as she faced judges.

Laura is being held in a 15ft by 15ft cell with 25 other women with her family spending £10,000 on legal bills.

But she was stopped at the airport as she jetted in for a fortnight stay with Omar - who she sees four times per year.

The last text message sent by the shop keeper was to her father, Neville, and said: 'I'm in trouble and I need your help.'

Tramadol is prescription-only in the UK and a pill is worth 8pm, which means Mrs Plummer could have only made a maximum of £23.20 if she had intended to sell them.

The Foreign Office confirmed they are assisting a British national in Egypt.

Jane Merrick alleged that the former defence secretary tried to kiss her on the lips after a lunch in 2003.

It is reported that a call to No 10 from Ms Merrick - who works as a freelance for CNN, The Telegraph and The Times among others - helped pave the way to the Cabinet minister's sudden departure from his role this week.

She claimed she decided to formally complain after seeing similar allegations come to light.

Writing in the Observer about the encounter, which took place when she was a 29-year-old junior political reporter at the Daily Mail, Ms Merrick said: 'I felt humiliated, ashamed.

Jane Merrick, pictured right, alleged that former defence secretary Michael Fallon, pictured left, tried to kiss her on the lips after a lunch in 2003

'Was I even guilty that maybe I had led him on in some way by drinking with him?

'After years of having a drink with so many other MPs who have not acted inappropriately towards me, I now know I was not.'

The journalist had previously written about the alleged incident but had chosen not to name Sir Michael.

He stepped down earlier this week after it emerged that he had touched radio host Julia Hartley Brewer on the knee 15 years earlier.

Sir Michael's cabinet colleague Andrea Leadsom then claimed he had made lewd remarks to her.

Gavin Williamson - who has now been named Defence Secretary - is said to have warned the Prime Minister there could be further allegations about his predecessor, who has been the subject of Westminster gossip for years.

One source claimed Mr Williamson had advised Mrs May to fire the veteran minister, although others insisted Sir Michael had resigned of his own accord following a face-to-face showdown in No 10.

He stepped down earlier this week after it emerged that he had touched radio host Julia Hartley Brewer on the knee 15 years earlier

Sir Michael's cabinet colleague Andrea Leadsom also claimed he had made lewd remarks to her

But friends of the MP acknowledged he had been braced for the possibility of more claims about his behaviour.

Three years ago he was accused of calling journalist Bryony Gordon a ‘slut’ at a party.

One friend said: ‘Has there been flirtation that has been inappropriate? Yes, he will concede that.’

The allegations come as the sexual harassment scandal engulfing Westminster shows little sign of abating.

Labour's Harriet Harman hit back at claims that a witch hunt against politicians was under way.

The former deputy party leader told the BBC: 'There are a lot of men saying this has been totally blown out of all proportion, this a witch hunt. No, it's not a witch hunt, it's long overdue.'

But Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale said MPs and other prominent figures were on a 'hiding to nothing' as it was difficult to refute claims about alleged incidents years ago.

Labour's Harriet Harman hit back at claims that a witch hunt against politicians was under way

Giving a hypothetical example of a woman claiming a man kissed her in a lift five years ago, Sir Roger told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'How does a Member of Parliament refute that? It's a witch hunt.'

Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said she was ashamed at some of the 'disgusting' allegations of sexual abuse in the Labour Party.

Ms Thornberry, who said she had experienced inappropriate behaviour, told the BBC: 'Some of the things that I have heard in the last week have been so disgusting and I am ashamed that this could happen in the Labour Party.'

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for party leaders to agree new independent procedures when they meet next week to discuss how to deal with sexual harassment claims.

He told the BBC: 'We have had one of our members come forward and said that she was raped. That is just unacceptable.

'We have had sexual harassment across all the political parties by the looks of it. So, we have got to tackle it.'

Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Lord Bew, said outside bodies need to be involved in harassment investigations to avoid claims of a cover-up.

The allegations come as the sexual harassment scandal engulfing Westminster shows little sign of abating

He told the BBC: 'The parties need to get a grip of this issue of accountability. It's vital that these things are not seen to be done in-house.

'It is vital that there are people outside Parliament in cases of harassment, and so on, who are there, who can give some reassurance to the public that this is not just another cover-up.'

As Westminster was hit by fresh claims of inappropriate behaviour, three MPs denied wrongdoing.

Norwich South MP Clive Lewis denied a claim that he groped a woman at the Labour conference in September after it emerged that the party was investigating a formal complaint against him.

Former Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis denied he had made non-consensual sexual advances towards women.

The Bury South MP made the remarks after BuzzFeed News reported that a woman alleged he touched her leg and invited her to his house when she was 19 and at a Labour Party event in 2010.

Mr Lewis said he had 'never made non-consensual sexual comments or sexual advances to women'.

Suspended Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins said he categorically denied allegations of inappropriate conduct made by activist Ava Etemadzadeh, which the party is investigating."

But J. K. Rowling’s creation remains as popular as ever, to judge by the extraordinary success of her Pottermore website, where you can find all you need to know, and more, about the boy wizard.

The site yielded a royalty payment of £4.8 million for the year, to add to Ms Rowling’s estimated £650 million fortune.

J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter website earned the author some £4.5 million last year

In the 20 years since Harry Potter first hit the shelves, it has earned Ms Rowling £650million

Financial accounts filed by Pottermore show that in the 12 months to March 31, 2017, sales leapt from £15 million to £40 million, thanks mainly to the popularity of the ebook version of the script for the acclaimed stage play Harry Potter And The Cursed Child, and the electronic version of the screenplay for the spin-off feature film Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them, starring Eddie Redmayne.

After royalties and other expenses, the company made a pre-tax profit of £3.5 million compared to a £4.9 million loss the previous year.

Commercial director Tom Greene said: ‘It is now an efficient, cash-generative publishing operation producing content that delights millions of fans.’

Pottermore will soon release digital editions of the Harry Potter: A History Of Magic book.

Ms Rowling has given large chunks of her fortune to charity."
Chris Velazco,"The future of the iPhone here, and we spent a week with it.",2017-11-03T16:00:00Z,engadget,iPhone X review: Embrace the new normal,https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/03/apple-iphone-x-review/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fa77372d02698ddbfc44ea16b49bdb0f7%2F205830010%2F_MG_4584-2.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=b298748b6ed98cfd3925e3cf35daccd293215243,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"The iPhone X runs iOS 11, but not the version you've come to appreciate (or loathe) for months. Because Apple killed the home button, it had to drastically rewrite the rules for how we interact with iPhones. It, uh, takes a little getting used to.

Let's start with the basics. In lieu of tapping a home button, swiping up from the bottom of an app bounces you back to the home screen. To view all of your running apps in the app switcher, you have to swipe up from the bottom of the screen and hold for a split second — you'll get a haptic bzzzt as the row of app cards slides into place. Closing those apps takes an extra step now, though. You'll have to press and hold one of the windows, then either tap a tiny x in the corner or swipe it away. It's a necessary change, since swiping up brings you to the home screen, but it was definitely annoying at first. Swiping down from the notch (or just to its left) reveals your notifications. And see that little bar at the bottom of the screen? Swiping left and right on it cycles you through all of your currently running apps. It's a small touch, but an elegant one.

While most of this stuff became second nature quickly, some old habits still throw me for a loop. I never reach for a home button that isn't there, but I often swipe up from the bottom of the screen hoping the control center shows up. It never does, because you now have to swipe down from the space to the right of the notch. My muscle memory will eventually rewrite itself, but in the meantime, I look like a doofus every time I try.

Now, if you're really concerned about not having a home button, a quick trip to the phone's settings might help. Pop into Settings>General>Accessibility and turn on Assistive Touch. Now you'll have a virtual key that brings up various controls when pressed. If you set the single-tap action to ""Home,"" you're left with what amounts to an onscreen home button. It's far from a perfect solution, though, since every time you fire up a non-full-screen app, the home button flies to the top-right corner of the screen.

While we're talking about accessibility settings, there's one more you really should know about. Reachability is handy for folks with smaller hands, since it brings what's displayed at the top of the iPhone's screen down so it's easier to reach. The lack of a home button makes things more finicky, though — you'll have to swipe down on the very bottom of the screen to use it, and it's a little too easy to mess up.

Of course, iPhone X comes with two features that people haven't been able to stop talking about: Face ID and Animoji. The former replaces the Touch ID fingerprint sensor with an infrared camera system that turns the contours of your face into a password. The latter uses the same camera system to map your face's movements onto 12 emoji so you can make a cute yellow kitty say terrible, terrible things.

I'll be honest: I wasn't expecting much, but Face ID turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Enrolling a face (you can only have one) was painless, if a little awkward, since you have to roll your head around so the camera fully captures your face's nuances. After that, unlocking the phone with a glance worked nearly every time. Recognition generally takes about one second, but since you still have to swipe up to view your home screen after unlocking the phone, the whole process seems just a hair slower than using Touch ID.

If you're mulling an iPhone X purchase, you'd better be OK with using Face ID for everything. Scanning your face doesn't just unlock the phone; it also verifies login credentials in your keychain, so every app that used Touch ID now uses your face. For the most part, this is fantastic. Need to check your balance? Just launch your banking app and by the time you're prompted to sign in, Face ID will have recognized you and filled in your password. Authenticating apps and Apple Pay payments with just a glance works too. When everything works the way it's supposed to, Face ID feels like a frictionless bit of the future.

I've noticed Face ID faltering in only a few situations. For some reason, it doesn't always work immediately when I've just woken up — maybe it's because my eyes aren't fully open, or perhaps my face is puffier than usual. Either way, checking my email before I get out of bed takes more effort than I prefer. That could change, though. Your Face ID model isn't static and adapts over time. So if you keep trying to unlock the X while bleary-eyed, it should figure it out. Ditto if I lose weight or manage to grow a decent beard.

But what about security? In day-to-day use, it's a non-issue. For one, the iPhone X checks to see that you're alert and paying attention. That means that it won't unlock if your eyes aren't open, or if you aren't looking directly at the screen. I've heard from other reviewers that this doesn't always work as intended, but I never had any problems. That's generally good news for people afraid that someone else (say, a jealous significant other) would try to unlock the iPhone X with the owner's face while he or she is sleeping.

Beyond that, Face ID is just good at knowing what you look like. Most of the time I wear glasses and go clean-shaven. This week, I ditched my glasses for contacts and tried (mostly in vain) to grow some facial hair, and Face ID kept up just fine. It also refused to unlock when I held up photos of myself, or put the X in front of people I'm occasionally mistaken for ('sup, Edgar). I haven't been able to test this myself, but identical twins can indeed unlock each other's iPhone X -- this is an unfortunate side effect of the Face ID concept, and there's no apparent fix aside from hoping your doppelgänger isn't a total jerk. Thankfully, as the Wall Street Journal confirmed, a theater-quality mask of your face won't do the trick.

And then there are the Animoji. I've already accepted that the age of talking poo is here. The iPhone X's front-facing camera cluster does a good job at mapping facial gestures onto one of 12 cutesy emoji avatars, and I was a little shocked to hear how long and crisp the accompanying 10-second audio recordings were. I can't imagine these things won't get obnoxious, but I can't help but appreciate the technical achievement. There's one thing you should know, though: The longer you spend trying on all those adorkable avatar faces, the warmer the phone gets.

Despite all the power inside, the One X is Microsoft's smallest console to date. It looks similar to the Xbox One S, except it has an entirely matte black case and is slightly slimmer. It's also surprisingly dense -- the console weighs 8.4 pounds, but it feels far heavier than you'd expect for its size, thanks to all of its new hardware. The One S, in comparison, weighs two pounds less.

The Xbox One X's real upgrades are under the hood. It features an 8-core CPU running at 2.3Ghz, 12GB of GDDR5 RAM, a 1 terabyte hard drive and an upgraded AMD Polaris GPU with 6 teraflops of computing power. The PS4 Pro has only 8GB of RAM and tops out at 4.2 teraflops. Microsoft's console is clearly faster. That additional horsepower means the Xbox One X can run more games in full native 4K than the Sony's console.

Along the front, there's the slot-loading 4K Blu-ray drive, a physical power button, a single USB port and a controller pairing button. And around back, there are HDMI out and in ports, the latter of which lets you plug in your cable box. Additionally, there are two USB ports, connections for optical audio, IR out, and gigabit Ethernet. If you've still got a Kinect around, you'll need to use a USB adapter to plug it in."

Maybe that's why he didn't check it out right away. He hung on to it for a few days, thinking little of it before popping it into a public computer at the library when he logged on to look for work.

To what we can only guess was his horror-and-surprise, he discovered the unencrypted, password-free thumb drive held 2.5GB of data evidently belonging to Heathrow Airport's highest level security team.

Rather than take it to the police, he opted to hand the USB stick over to press -- the tabloid paper Sunday Mirror. The Mirror promptly reported that the little drive contained 76 folders comprised of around 200 documents, maps, videos, timetables for anti-terrorism patrons, and much more, tediously compiled and with information across numerous different systems.

The Mirror wrote that it held:

The exact route the Queen takes when using the airport and security measures used to protect her.

Files disclosing every type of ID needed – even those used by covert cops – to access restricted areas.

A timetable of patrols that was used to guard the site against suicide bombers and terror attacks.

Maps pinpointing CCTV cameras and a network of tunnels and escape shafts linked to the Heathrow Express.

Routes and safeguards for Cabinet ministers and foreign dignitaries.

Details of the ultrasound radar system used to scan runways and the perimeter fence.

To anyone working in security, this is a disastrous data set to suddenly discover is out in the wild, for an unknown amount of time, and in unknown hands. Especially at a time when officials have just stated that ""Britain is facing its most severe ever terrorist threat."" Right now the UK is on a terror alert at the level of ""severe"" -- down from ""critical"" -- after the September 17 Parsons Green tube bombing terror attack.

The Mirror reported that the London Metropolitan Police were working with airport officials to figure out how the USB stick and its information ended up physically exfiltrated from Heathrow and tossed in the bushes along an unremarkable street in London.

Of course, our first thoughts are that it was terrorists. But in the realm of all things security, it's also possible that it was the work of errorists. Maybe they're used to this sort of thing in the UK, though we are now too. Over here in the US, we're running out of digits to count the number of times our government security secrets have ended up on a contractor's computer, were promptly stolen, and then ended up ""in the wild"" where they've been used for all kinds of harm and completely avoidable stupidity.

This stuff keeps ending up on security contractor's computers because when we say ""ended up on a contractor's computer"" what we really mean is that some hacker working for Booz Allen or whoever did that thing that hackers do: They hoard. I've often thought there should be a version of ""Hoarders"" just for hackers, until I realized that was what was in the headlines every day anyway, and it would end up being too depressing.

It wouldn't be depressing just because our security is a grade-A disaster, or because I believe every kind of hacker -- white hat, black hat, grey hat, whatever nacho-flavored hat -- has compulsively sticky fingers. It would be depressing because hackers are often crap at their own personal security. They will correct you, talk down to you, call users stupid every minute of the day, but it's by and large a culture of not practicing what they preach for various reasons. If you doubt me, just look at how many of them get caught.

The point is, secrets are like catnip to hackers, and the feeling of power makes them sloppy. But oh, do they hoard. The hoarding is also functional: With employment and getting gigs, he who has the most vulns, wins. So if the USB stick with all the Queen's secrets (literally) about Heathrow Airport ended up falling out of some red teamer or physical pentester's pocket on a random street in London, bouncing into the bushes after being hired to do a security assessment on the airport, it's not going to be a surprise. To me, anyway.

In a follow up Wednesday, International Airport Review reported that a meeting of the House of Commons Transport Committee was held on Monday in an attempt to find out what the hell was going on. In it, Heathrow's Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye was asked what he knew about the USB stick, and what the airport was doing in its official capacity to investigate.

Holland-Kaye began with the usual verbal sleight of hand we hear from every business and organization that gets pwned, namely, that they take security very seriously. Once that commercial for nothing was over, he acknowledged that the Metropolitan Police were assisting with their investigation in addition to ""setting up an independent internal enquiry.""

""From the information I have seen that was on the USB stick and reported in the papers,"" he said, ""there was nothing there that causes us any security concerns. From what I have seen, Heathrow is completely secure."" Was he even worried? Maybe, or maybe not. Holland-Kaye added that they ""will be reviewing that with a critical eye to see that if there are any procedures to be changed they are changed quickly to ensure that we stay ahead of the game.""

It's not the most reassuring statement, to be certain. But in an era of things somehow able to only get almost comedically worse, like having your fire extinguisher catch on fire while putting out a fire, let's hope the somewhere in West London there's a pentester watching all this in the news and just feeling really, really embarrassed.

She can deploy an energy ball that can either heal in an area or pinball around, causing damage. She also has an evasive ability that lets her fade out and teleport a short distance away . Her ultimate ability is a linear beam that simultaneously damages enemies and heals allies if they fall in its path.

While the game's community has enjoyed the four new characters added to the game since its launch in May 2016, they've consistently asked for additional healers to give teams more support options. Moira looks to fill this gap with equal offensive and defensive capability, though we'll know more when Blizzard adds her to the test servers at an undisclosed date.

Finally, Blizzard released a cinematic telling the story behind Reinhardt's early days. Turns out our favorite hammer-wielding German armored teddy bear was a brash youth who had to learn his lesson the hard way. You know, the one about sticking with your team? Yeah, you've heard that one."

In a bit that poked fun at the White House press secretary, Bryant fielded questions from journalists who wanted to know how she could keep maintaining there’s no connection between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, especially in light of this week’s indictments. Cue a fantasy sequence soundtracked by Lovato’s “Confident.”

Although Bryant-as-Huckabee Sanders sticks to the song’s original lyrics during the first couple cutaways, she begins to change it up about halfway through: “So you say that I’m a puppet, that I must be out of my mind, all your media can stuff it,” she sings after breaking through a massive copy of The New York Times.

Even legendary comedians get the giggles sometimes. Case in point: Larry David on Saturday Night Live this weekend, where he kept breaking during a sketch that maybe was, maybe wasn’t a parody of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Erika Jayne.

The Curb Your Enthusiasm star tried to get out his lines between fits of laughter, while his scene partners, including Kate McKinnon, managed to play it (mostly) straight.

The worst of it — or the best of it, because who doesn’t want to watch the famously dry David crack up? — comes at the end, as David explains how long they can stay out that night. “We have time to hear one song, and then go, which is perfect, because after that, the club is overrun with thirsty bottomfeeders,” he struggles to say, laughing the entire time.

Ahead of the episode’s premiere, some outlets reported that players George Springer, José Altuve, and Alex Bregman would be appearing on the show. They made their cameo while Leslie Jones was making fun of them; she changed her tune once they presented her with an Astros jersey and a baseball. “Oh, I like balls!” she joked before calling the guys “fine as hell” and congratulating them on their win.

She then took back what she had said about them before — and even let Altuve sit on her lap. “This is not something I usually say at all — I mean, never — but good things do come in small packages,” she quipped.

Last year, Larry David memorably became Bernie Sanders in a pre-taped sketch titled “Bern Your Enthusiasm,” and David-as-Sanders once again graced Saturday Night Live this weekend, this time in a Price Is Right spoof that also included a cameo from musical guest Miley Cyrus — and her boyfriend Liam Hemsworth.

And fake Bernie was in full Bernie form: “The real problem in this country is American consumerism,” he said. “Who needs a washer? When I need to wash the one suit I own, I just wait until it rains, I stand outside for 15 minutes, and then I jog behind a bus until the exhaust dries me off.” That’s one way to do it.

When Bernie’s teammate Derrick (Pete Davidson) points out that he wants money, Sanders gives him a tip for how to make some dough without winning a game show. “Here’s what you do: When you go to a gas station, and you see the ‘take a penny, leave a penny,’ you always take a penny,” he advised. “That’s how I bought my first house.”

The Curb Your Enthusiasm star ended his opening words with a joke that left a poor taste in many viewers’ mouths: “I’ve always been obsessed with women, and I’ve often wondered: If I’d grown up in Poland when Hitler came to power and was sent to a concentration camp, would I still be checking out women in the camp?” he started before imagining what kind of conversation he’d have with another guy as they figured out how to flirt.

“The problem is, there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp,” he continued, then proposed some: “‘How’s it going? They treatin’ you okay? You know, if we ever get out of here, I’d love to take you out for some latkes. You like latkes?'”

Although many Twitter users were not fans of David’s bit, some defended it: “Larry David may be the most important Jewish comedian ever,” user Barret tweeted. “He’s allowed to make concentration camp jokes.”

Forget cold open — this weekend’s Saturday Night Live kicked off with a cold shower.

Alec Baldwin returned to studio 8H as President Donald Trump to have some onscreen bathtime with Mike Pence (Beck Bennett), Jeff Sessions (Kate McKinnon), and Paul Manafort (Alex Moffat) in an absurd, political sketch that began with Trump and Manafort… clothed in an office.

“It’s a shame you’re going to prison, because I was about to give you a yuge tax break,” Trump says to Manafort before encouraging him to bring a “shiv” to prison. “Because after the stuff I’ve said about certain ethnic groups, they are really gonna go to town on you in prison.”

Soon enough, Trump and Manafort are in the shower, where Trump brought Manafort to make sure he’s not wearing a wire. There, Baldwin-as-POTUS makes a dig at Harvey Weinstein: “What an idiot that Harvey Weinstein is,” he says, “he could have gotten away with all of it if only he had gotten elected president.”

“Jimmy Fallon’s mother, Gloria, died peacefully on Saturday,” A Fallon family spokesperson told PEOPLE in a statement. “Jimmy was at his mother’s bedside, along with her loved ones, when she passed away at NYU Langone Medical Center in NYC. Our prayers go out to Jimmy and his family as they go through this tough time.”

The tragic news comes after Fallon cancelled a Nov. 3 taping of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon due to a “private Fallon family matter.”

A source revealed to PEOPLE then that Gloria was sick and that Fallon, 43, had gone to the hospital to be by her side.

“Jimmy comes from a very close knit family, and together with the rest of his loved ones they are by her side right now,” the source added.

Although Fallon is known to keep his family life private, he’s shared funny stories and sweet moments about his mother over the years.

In June, he revealed to Howard Stern that his mother used to be a nun. A month earlier, he shared a memory about Gloria as part of a “#MomQuotes” segment for the talk show.

In a powerful statement to Access Hollywood — which was given in October but has since gone viral through a tweet from journalist Yashar Ali — the Kill Bill star said “it’s commendable” for so many women to come forward with their own experiences of harassment and assault. However, she’s not yet ready to speak out.

“I don’t have a tidy soundbite for you because I’ve learned I am not a child and I have learned that when I’ve spoken in anger, I usually regret the way I express myself,” Thurman says in the video clip. “So I’ve been waiting to feel less angry and when I’m ready, I’ll say what I have to say.”

Weinstein — who worked with Thurman on Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, and various other films — is currently under investigation by police in New York, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and the U.K. for sexual assault accusations. The former Hollywood producer has denied any claims of non-consensual sex and sought treatment at a luxury resort in Arizona. The NYPD stated on Friday that actress Paz de la Huerta, who alleges Weinstein raped her twice in 2010, has “credible” claims and are in the midst of gathering evidence.

Numerous women have come forward against Weinstein in the wake of damning exposés from The New York Times and The New Yorker, while even more individuals have alleged similar behavior from men like former Amazon Studios head Roy Price, Kevin Spacey, directors Brett Ratner and James Toback, and former NBC political journalist Mark Halperin.

Directed by indie filmmaker Taika Waititi (The Hunt for the Wilderpeople), the latest release from the Marvel Cinematic Universe earned $46.8 million from Friday screenings in the U.S. — including the $14.5 million from Thursday shows.

By comparison, Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 and Spider-Man: Homecoming — the two other Marvel Studios titles from 2017 — earned approximately $56.3 million and $50.5 million from their respective Friday night turnouts. Doctor Strange, which opened around this time last year, began its opening weekend gross with approximately $32.6 million.

Thor: Ragnarok‘s preliminary numbers put the film on track to earn upwards of $120 million by the end of the weekend, should ticket sales hold steady. It would also make this the highest grosser of the Thor trilogy; Thor finished its opening week with $65.7 million and Thor: The Dark World earned $85.7 million.

Meanwhile, A Bad Moms Christmas, which premiered on Wednesday, earned $5.51 million on Friday for a domestic cumulative total of about $10 million.

Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Marvel’s thunder from Down Under in Thor: Ragnarok, which features Cate Blanchett as Hela. After his first face-off with the Goddess of Death, Thor is flung through space to the planet Sakaar, where he’s forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena against Hulk (Bruce Banner), who’s been on Sakaar since he went flying off at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Jeff Goldblum, Tom Hiddleston, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban, Idris Elba, Anthony Hopkins, and Benedict Cumberbatch also feature in the film, which is one of the most highly reviewed Marvel films on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praised the comedy of Thor: Ragnarok, though some found issues with character and general Marvel formula.

“Thankfully, the newest — and unquestionably funniest — big-screen Marvel adventure, Thor: Ragnarok, seems hellbent on finally unleashing Hemsworth’s real secret weapon: his humor,” EW’s Chris Nashawaty writes. “With the exception of Deadpool and the Guardians of the Galaxy films, Ragnarok may be the only Marvel-hero movie that feels like it’s first and foremost a comedy. And on those terms — and those terms only — it’s a triumph.”"

(0:59)

Saturday gave us seven games between ranked teams, making this arguably the best slate all season.

But how much fun was Week 10? Are we talking fun like ""kids going to Disney World for the first time"" fun? Or fun as in ""parents taking their kids to Disney World for the first time""?

There was joy and misery for top teams -- delight for Oklahoma, disaster for Ohio State and Penn State. Strange things seemed to happen in unexpected places. (Have you ever seen a quarterback ejected for targeting?) We even had our first Lane Kiffin controversy in quite some time.

Who scored highest and lowest on the fun-o-meter in Week 10? Let's start with the good stuff.

Les Miles palm-clapping fun

You know SEC commissioner Greg Sankey is exhaling a big sigh of relief right now. In what has been a very mediocre year for SEC football, he has the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the country -- lipstick on the SEC's pig.

Editor's Picks College Football Playoff picks after Week 10 The top five teams in the College Football Playoff rankings all won, so there's not much movement in this week's predictions. But there's still some disagreement on who belongs after Alabama, Georgia and Notre Dame.

There's even a competent opponent for Alabama in the SEC title game with the emergence of Georgia. (Sorry, Auburn and Mississippi State, you aren't catching Bama this year.) Not since the Bulldogs literally came within 5 yards of knocking off the Crimson Tide and playing for a national championship in 2012 has Alabama had any sort of competition in Atlanta.

Finally, the East isn't sending a sacrificial lamb to Atlanta! This is a welcome change for the SEC and Sankey, who isn't in charge of the best football conference this year but might get two teams in the College Football Playoff.

Slick.

'Bart Simpson at the chalkboard' fun

If you aren't following Lane Kiffin on Twitter, rethink your priorities. As he has been guiding Florida Atlantic (5-0 in Conference USA and bowl eligible), he has also been troll, troll, trolling his boat all over Twitter. He took on his old boss Nick Saban over his ""rat poison"" comments.

On Friday, Kiffin poked Saban again, this time including Las Vegas. During the Owls' win over Marshall, while leading 30-23 with less than 10 seconds remaining, Kiffin made the right call by having his punter run into the end zone for a safety. It was brought to his attention that by winning 30-25, Florida Atlantic did not cover the point spread.

Naturally, Kiffin responded.

Power 5 athletic directors: One of you must hire him after this season.

'Sad Urban Meyer eating pizza' fun

You had one job, Ohio State and Penn State. Yet, here we are, waving goodbye to the Big Ten's playoff hopes before Thanksgiving.

No team coached by Urban Meyer had given up more than 50 points until Ohio State's 55-24 loss to Iowa. Jeffrey Becker-USA TODAY Sports

Penn State endured a lengthy weather delay in East Lansing before losing 27-24 to Michigan State, and Ohio State was blown out by Iowa 55-24. A week ago, Ohio State was back in the playoff race and Earth was back on its axis. Now, Iowa appears to have a high-octane, Pac-12-style offense.

The Big Ten's playoff hopes now rest with No. 9 Wisconsin, which is undefeated but registers about a three in the schedule-respect column.

Congratulations, Iowa -- you sabotaged your own conference!

'Gotta laugh to keep from crying' fun

Florida took the first step in pulling the plug on an already lost season when the school and Jim McElwain mutually decided to part ways. But unfortunately for everyone involved, the Gators still have a season to finish. Florida lost to Missouri 45-16 and is now 3-5 with four straight losses (all without scoring 20 points). The Gators absolutely rolled over and made a Mizzou team with zero SEC wins look like Alabama, so linebacker David Reese called his team out for quitting.

""It's sometimes disappointing when everybody doesn't want to come together and just play for each other,"" Reese said. ""That's sad to see. We've still got a lot to play for. Me, personally, and our defense, we want to play for those guys. We can't have appearances like we just had today. That's unacceptable.""

Tennessee beat Southern Miss 24-10 but was up 10-3 at halftime and had to burn quarterback Will McBride's redshirt in the process. He went 1-of-8 passing.

Butch Jones' seat in Knoxville has disintegrated from the heat, but I'm sure the Vols will be champions of something after a win that keeps them alive for the postseason.

Vols fans should be thrilled.

'Don't hit send' fun Arkansas football

Look, Arkansas coach Bret Bielema needed a win over Coastal Carolina, but it isn't a good look when you have to come back and beat a member of Ryan McGee's esteemed Bottom 10 at home. The Razorbacks survived 39-38 but should have lost. That's why when Arkansas sent out a tweet confirming that the Razorbacks did, in fact, survive utter disaster, naturally, Arkansas fans took offense to the school's publicizing such an ugly win.

We actually suggest you read the comments.

'Flag-planting' fun

What can't Baker Mayfield do? He overcame two interceptions to throw for a school-record 598 yards and had six total touchdowns in No. 5 Oklahoma's wild 62-52 win over No. 11 Oklahoma State.

This is how Webster's dictionary defines ""bedlam"": ""a place, scene, or state of uproar and confusion."" That's exactly what it was in Stillwater.

The Sooners and Cowboys combined for 114 points and hit the over/under (76) at halftime. There were 1,446 yards, 62 first downs and five turnovers in this game.

These teams combined for 52 points and 540 yards in the second quarter alone, while Mayfield threw for a school-record 387 yards in the first half. His receiver, Marquise Brown, caught nine passes for a school-record 265 yards and had touchdowns of 84 and 77 yards.

""It was like a 15-rounder,"" OU coach Lincoln Riley said. ""It was a heavyweight battle. Both teams laid it all on the line.""

Fifteen-rounder? This was a hurricane locked in a coat closet.

The crotchety, get-off-my-lawn college football enthusiast probably hated this game, but if you didn't have fun watching these two teams carve up opposing air all day, then I'm sure your 56K modem can dial up the Alabama-LSU BCS title game from the 2011 season.

'Barney Stinson high-fiving' fun

People laughed at Jimbo Fisher when he said that the ACC was the nation's best conference, but it's not as crazy as it sounded at the time.

The ACC joined the Pac-12 as the only conferences to have two games in which both teams were ranked on Saturday. No. 4 Clemson slipped by No. 20 NC State 38-31, and No. 10 Miami topped No. 13 Virginia Tech 28-10. By the time Tuesday's playoff rankings come out, the ACC should join the SEC and Big 12 with two teams in the top 10.

And you thought this conference was doomed after Florida State turned into a soup sandwich.

'Good job, good effort' fun

It's not every day that a quarterback is ejected for targeting. They're usually the ones getting peeled off the turf from such hits. Not at Northern Arizona.

No, they teach their QBs to hit.

Next door at a children's hospital overlooking Kinnick Stadium, a boy got just what he had hoped for. (0:47)

IOWA CITY, Iowa -- Iowa long-snapper Tyler Kluver weighs 215 pounds. ""On a good day,"" that is, he said. And he's at least a couple of inches short of 6 feet tall.

The senior from Marshalltown, Iowa, looks more like your chemistry lab partner than the guy whose reception slew sixth-ranked Ohio State, essentially eliminating the high-powered Buckeyes from College Football Playoff contention.

But with just more than three minutes to play in the third quarter on Saturday at Kinnick Stadium, Kluver heard the call from offensive guard Keegan Render as the Hawkeyes took the field to line up for a field goal on fourth-and-3 from the Ohio State 20-yard line.

Pole Cat.

""Really, we're running it?"" Kluver said, recalling his response to the playcall after Iowa's 55-24 thumping of the Buckeyes. ""OK. I double- and triple-checked with my holder. Honestly, in a game like this, we knew we were going to need stuff like that to compete.""

The fake, a pass from the holder to the snapper, was designed by Iowa tight ends coach and special teams coordinator LeVar Woods in time for the Sept. 30 Michigan State game. The plan called for Iowa to run it early in a recent game, but the right moment never materialized.

""The third quarter works, too,"" Kluver said, ""in a big-time situation.""

The result? A first down at the 2-yard line. Iowa QB Nate Stanley hit tight end T.J. Hockenson for a touchdown on the next play. The Hawkeyes led 38-17, and there was no coming back for Ohio State.

Pole Cat fit among a series of big plays on Saturday for the Hawkeyes that turned a potential nail-biter into a 31-point victory.

There was the first snap from scrimmage as safety Amani Hooker baited Ohio State quarterback J.T. Barrett and stepped in front of receiver Binjimen Victor to grab an interception. Hooker returned it 30 yards for a touchdown, the first interception of Barrett since Week 2 -- ending a stretch of 190 straight passes without a pick.

Editor's Picks Iowa routs Ohio State to squash the Buckeyes' playoff path Iowa pulled its Kinnick magic once again, unexpectedly routing No. 6 Ohio State and likely eliminating the Buckeyes from Playoff consideration.

""I saw it in the commercial,"" Hooker said, asked if he knew of Barrett's streak, which encompassed 22 touchdown throws. ""He had a long streak and we wanted to break it. I didn't think it was going to be that easy.""

There, too, was the targeting call on Ohio State's Nick Bosa, which extended an Iowa drive with the game tied at 17 after a third-and-8 incompletion late in the second quarter. It left the Buckeyes without their star defensive end for the remainder of the game and led to an Iowa touchdown, then another late TD -- after the first of Josh Jackson's three interceptions -- to put Iowa on top 31-17 at halftime.

But the fake field goal will live longest in Iowa lore.

""We copied it from somebody,"" head coach Kirk Ferentz said. ""I'm not sure who.""

Seconds after Kluver learned of the call, Colten Rastetter, Iowa's sophomore punter and holder, yelled for the Hawkeyes to shift into a Swinging Gate formation.

Place-kicker Miguel Recinos went in motion toward the yard-line numbers on the far side of the field in front of the Ohio State sideline, where the entire offensive line waited without the football. Defensive end A.J. Epenesa ran in motion toward Rastetter, alone in the backfield, behind four players near the line of scrimmage, including Kluver.

Defensive end Jonathon Cooper rushed Rastetter, who shoved the ball downfield more than he threw it.

""It was a little above average,"" Rastetter said of the pass.

Kluver was the only option on the play. If he wasn't open, Rastetter was instructed not to look for another receiver. And definitely not to try to run for the first down.

""Just go down,"" Rastetter said. ""That's what I was told.""

But Kluver was open, racing past linebacker Tuf Borland into clear space near the 10-yard line.

""My heart fluttered a little bit,"" Kluver said.

The pass from his holder was underthrown. Kluver adjusted and made the catch.

""I've tried over the course of my career to show that I'm an athlete, not just a long-snapper,"" Kluver said with a straight face. ""I'm pretty confident in my physical ability, regardless of what I was given genetically.""

Ferentz said he was more worried about the throw than the catch.

Kluver stumbled to the ground short of the goal line as Recinos, the kicker, and defensive lineman Jake Hulett raced to celebrate with him.

The long-snapper said he should have scored on the play. ""I'll kick myself over it forever,"" he said.

No matter, his spot in Iowa history is secure."

(0:27)

NEW YORK -- One of the most anticipated grudge matches of the year lived up to the hype Saturday night -- and it was TJ Dillashaw who had the final say.

Dillashaw (15-3) knocked out Cody Garbrandt at 2:41 of the second round in their bantamweight title fight, reclaiming the 135-pound championship he lost in early 2016. The 135-pound title fight co-headlined UFC 217 at Madison Square Garden.

UFC 217 undercard recap Prior to UFC 217's main event between Michael Bisping and Georges St-Pierre, a multitude of undercard fights had major implications. Here's how it went down. 2 Related

It was an emotional matchup for both. Dillashaw used to train alongside Garbrandt (11-1) at Team Alpha Male in Sacramento, California, and left the team in 2015 on bad terms.

""You know, there was no animosity on my side,"" Dillashaw said. ""I knew I was fighting a very dangerous opponent. He's fast, powerful. That's going to make you more nervous than you need to be. You don't need any more pressure to it. I didn't put any animosity. I wasn't worried about the trash talk.

""I was worried about getting better and getting my belt back, which should've never left my waist.""

The finish came shortly after Dillashaw dropped Garbrandt with a right hand in the pocket. Garbrandt tried to scramble up, but Dillashaw followed him to the floor and put him away.

Dillashaw described his strategy as, ""Lead the dance. Get out there, use your motion, don't go into his fight. Don't brawl with him. That's his only chance. Use his kicks. Stay long. That's what got me the victory.""

After the referee stepped in, Dillashaw stayed next to Garbrandt and screamed toward him. The two shook hands, however, after the result was read.

""I was just yelling,"" Dillashaw said. ""I was just excited. He stood up, and I was just yelling. Congratulations [to Garbrandt], man. He's a helluva fighter. He's young. I'll see him again. This isn't the end of Cody Garbrandt.""

From there, Dillashaw called out dominant 125-pound flyweight champion Demetrious Johnson, whom he tried to fight earlier this year, but Johnson preferred another matchup.

""Demetrious Johnson, I'm coming for you,"" Dillashaw said. ""I'm breaking you. You dodged me. I'm getting that belt at 125.""

The finish was made all the more impressive by the fact Dillashaw was badly hurt in the first round.

In fact, Dillashaw might have been saved by the bell in the opening round. Garbrandt dropped him with a clean right hand and was following up with punches as the bell sounded. Dillashaw wobbled back to his corner, but he recovered well in between rounds.

Moments into the second round, Dillashaw turned the tide with a left head kick that put Garbrandt down. The defending champ popped back up, but the strike gave Dillashaw confidence.

""The finish happened so fast,"" said Dillashaw. ""I dropped him with the left kick. I was kicking low, kicking his body, kicking low, but I slowly had the finish. I knew I'd keep the pressure and eventually I was going to finish. I hit him with the right hook as he circled out.""

It is the first loss of Garbrandt's career. Dillashaw, who trains in Los Angeles, has now won seven of eight."

NEW YORK -- Another invincible, unbeatable champion has fallen in female mixed martial arts.

Joanna Jedrzejczyk (14-1) went into UFC 217 on Saturday night as arguably the best female fighter in the world. She was attempting to tie Ronda Rousey's UFC record of six consecutive title defenses by a female against Rose Namajunas at Madison Square Garden.

She did not survive the opening round.

Namajunas (7-3) knocked out Jedrzejczyk with a left hook three minutes into their 115-pound title fight. The official time of the stoppage was 3:03, when referee John McCarthy stepped in as Jedrzejczyk started to tap from strikes on the ground.

It was an incredible moment for Namajunas, 25, who has spoken about an abusive background and went into the fight a significant betting underdog.

""There was so much crap going on in the media and stuff,"" Namajunas said. ""I just want to use my gift in martial arts to make the world a better place. This belt doesn't mean anything. Just be a good person. I know we fight, but this is entertainment. Afterwards, it's nothing.""

Jedrzejczyk, of Poland, has dealt with some adversity in the Octagon before but nothing close to this. She won the title in 2015 and had been more or less dominant in five defenses.

Namajunas picked at Jedrzejczyk from the outside at the start and then dropped her with a right hand. Jedrzejczyk worked immediately back to her feet and tried to smile away the knockdown, but Namajunas hurt her again moments later with a clean left hook to the chin.

""[In the] beginning of the fight, I felt I couldn't get the right distance, and it was a big surprise,"" Jedrzejczyk said. ""This is what I said before: Someone [who] never fought in the Octagon or ring doesn't know what it's like to get hit. I just got caught off, and this happened. It was a crazy night for the champions. It's a sport, so I will keep my head up. I will not hide because I lost. I will just come back stronger.""

Jedrzejczyk said she plans to go on vacation with her family and then ""figure out what I want to do,"" adding that she will talk to UFC president Dana White about what's next.

Jedrzejczyk did her best to intimidate Namajunas all week, pressing her face into the challenger's every time they squared off. During a final stare down on Friday, Namajunas calmly mouthed a prayer as Jedrzejczyk promised to ""take her soul.""

The win makes Namajunas the third strawweight champion in UFC history. She fought Carla Esparza in the promotion's inaugural title fight in 2014 but came up short."

(0:46)

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- As Miami rolled up one win after another, it became difficult to find anyone offering much praise outside the program.

""But who have the Hurricanes beaten?"" skeptics wondered, pointing to a résumé that lacked a Top 25 win.

""But are they really that good?"" critics asked, pointing to close calls against average teams.

The College Football Playoff selection committee telegraphed those questions when it released its first rankings earlier this week, placing unbeaten Miami at No. 10, behind six one-loss teams. That felt a little like a slap to those inside the Miami football facility, who refused to apologize for the way they had gone about winning all their games.

So what if they were close? Miami had won them, and that would have to be enough. But then Saturday night came along, and the Hurricanes showed how good they could be when they put together four dominant quarters.

Miami had the upper hand against No. 13 Virginia Tech from the start, owning the offensive and defensive lines drive after drive. That allowed the Hurricanes to gash the run defense Virginia Tech takes such great pride in, en route to their best performance this season -- a 28-10 win that should have those same critics re-evaluating Miami.

Especially with No. 3 Notre Dame coming to town next Saturday.

Miami had everything going for it on Saturday night, from a raucous home crowd that filled nearly every seat at Hard Rock Stadium, to intensity, aggressiveness and motivation. The Hurricanes even had Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez rooting them on, Rodriguez wearing what appeared to be a homemade turnover chain.

The defense got to wear the real turnover chain, too, with four takeaways on a night when it shut down the Virginia Tech run defense, flustered Josh Jackson and made All-ACC receiver Cam Phillips an afterthought.

Though Malik Rosier threw three interceptions, his play on the ground became an indispensable part of this game. He rushed for 84 yards and a touchdown. Those interceptions nearly cost Miami -- including one on the opening drive of the third quarter that Virginia Tech turned into a touchdown to close the gap to 14-10.

At that point, it appeared the Hokies had the momentum they so desperately needed and would turn this into the close game we all anticipated.

But the game swung on the following Virginia Tech drive. After Rosier threw another interception, Virginia Tech had the ball inside Miami territory. But a botched fourth-down attempt, in which the ball hit Sean Savoy as he ran in motion, gave the ball back to the Hurricanes.

Rosier hit Christopher Herndon IV for a 43-yard touchdown pass on the next drive, and Virginia Tech never got closer.

So now we are left with an entire week to get ready for Miami versus Notre Dame, a throwback matchup between two bitter rivals who suddenly find themselves in playoff contention. Will this one measure up to all those classic games in the late 1980s and early 1990s when this rivalry was at its most heated (and best)?

College GameDay will be in Miami, elevating this game's place during a crucial Week 11. The game will have no bearing on Miami's ACC championship hopes because the Hurricanes could find themselves clinching a spot in their first-ever ACC championship game next Saturday if Virginia loses to Louisville.

Notre Dame will have to wait, though, at least until Sunday. Miami has plenty to savor about its best win of the season."

(1:09)

STILLWATER, Okla. -- Of all the wild Bedlam showdowns, filled with unbelievable swings, unceasing scoring and unthinkable finishes, Saturday’s thriller in Stillwater just might have topped them all.

In the end, Baker Mayfield and Oklahoma outlasted Mason Rudolph and Oklahoma State 62-52, keeping the Sooners' dreams of advancing to the College Football Playoff alive, while extinguishing the Cowboys' hopes.

After failing to stop Oklahoma State for much of the game, Oklahoma’s beleaguered defense finally got a stop when it mattered the most.

On fourth-and-7 from the Sooners' 43-yard line, Rudolph’s pass went over the head of Tyron Johnson down the sideline, sealing Oklahoma’s third straight win over the Pokes.

In the waning seconds, Oklahoma running back Trey Sermon delivered the exclamation point before a sold-out Boone Pickens Stadium, dashing through a desperate Oklahoma State defense 53 yards for a touchdown.

Though Mayfield's third-and-goal interception toss late in the fourth quarter gave Rudolph and the Cowboys new life, Mayfield delivered another Heisman Trophy statement with yet another spectacular performance on the road.

Mayfield passed for 598 yards and five touchdowns, and he also stiff-armed Oklahoma State linebacker Justin Phillips for a 7-yard scoring run.

All told, Oklahoma rolled up 785 yards of offense. And Mayfield broke Landry Jones' school record for passing yards in a game and Sam Bradford’s school record for passing yards in a half.

The two teams combined for a Bedlam-record 114 points, topping the 102 the schools put up in 2008. Rudolph passed for 448 yards and five touchdowns. Yet as prolific as Rudolph was, Mayfield was even better.

And on the same day that Ohio State’s J.T. Barrett, Stanford’s Bryce Love and Penn State’s Saquon Barkley all lost, Mayfield might have played himself at the top of the Heisman conversation. He is aiming to join Herschel Walker as just the second player since the 1940s to finish in the top four of the Heisman voting three times.

With Iowa State falling at West Virginia, the Sooners can all but clinch a spot in the Big 12 title game next weekend in a massive showdown against eighth-ranked TCU that will whittle the number of the Big 12 title contenders to one, provided the Horned Frogs defeat Texas later Saturday night.

Including Saturday's victory, Oklahoma has now won 15 of the past 16 Bedlam meetings when both teams have been ranked."

(0:54)

NEW YORK -- Heavyweight world titleholder Deontay Wilder has lost out on the opportunity for two marquee fights because his opponents, Alexander Povetkin last year and Luis ""King Kong"" Ortiz last month, failed drug tests. The cancellations of the fights left Wilder emotional and upset, particularly the one with the big-punching Ortiz, whom he was supposed to fight on Saturday night at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Wilder instead faced replacement Bermane Stiverne, his mandatory challenger and from whom he took the title by lopsided decision in January 2015.

Editor's Picks Porter beats Granados, eyes Thurman rematch It wasn't pretty and it might not have been the exciting fight fans wanted, but Shawn Porter dominated Adrian Granados to become one of the mandatory challengers for titleholder Keith Thurman.

Wilder was so upset over the change of opponent that at the final pre-fight news conference on Thursday he promised a knockout in graphic terms, saying: ""The ambulance better be ready. The medical teams better be ready. The referee better be ready. They better have that towel to be able to throw it in because every blow is going to mean something. ... The only thing he's going to be able to do is pick his spot on the ground where he's going to lay at.""

Wilder lived up to his promise and absolutely destroyed Stiverne in the first round before 10,924 to retain his world title for the sixth time. He dropped an out-of-shape Stiverne three times before referee Arthur Mercante waved it off at 2 minutes, 59 seconds.

""So much frustration, it just seemed like my career, it's been crazy ... so many guys using PEDs,"" Wilder said after the fight. ""I just want to prove that I am the best. I know I am the best but I wanna prove I am the best. One champion, one face, one name, he goes by Deontay Wilder.""

The fight Wilder wants -- the one boxing fans want -- is a title unification showdown with two-belt titleholder Anthony Joshua (20-0, 20 KOs), 28, the hugely popular British fighter who retained his belts for the fourth time last Saturday with a 10th-round knockout of Carlos Takam before an indoor boxing-record crowd of 78,000 at Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales.

""I've been waiting on that fight for a long time now. I declare war upon you,"" Wilder said as if speaking to Joshua. ""Do you accept my challenge? I've been waiting for a long time. I know I'm the champion. I know I'm the best. Are you up for the test?""

Said promoter Lou DiBella, who also wants to see Wilder face Joshua: ""He'll put Anthony Joshua to sleep. No one has the reach he has. No one has the jab he has. No one has the power he has. Certainly, Anthony Joshua doesn't have it. Deontay Wilder is the scariest heavyweight on the planet.""

Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Boxing has campaigned for Wilder to first fight British contender Dillian Whyte, but there is little interest in that fight, at least on this side of the pond.

""Stop with this Dillian Whyte s---,"" DiBella said. ""Who the f--- is Dillian Whyte? Come on, Eddie, let's play. You want to do [Joshua-Wilder] at a soccer stadium in the U.K., let's do it. Deontay Wilder will put Anthony Joshua to sleep the same way he just put Stiverne to sleep. Nobody has that kind of power. Deontay Wilder is Anthony Joshua's worst nightmare. The winner of Joshua-Wilder is the real heavyweight champion. That fight has to happen. The boxing fans deserve it. We don't want to wait.""

Whyte (22-1, 16 KOs) outpointed Robert Helenius on the Joshua-Takam undercard and suffered his only loss by seventh-round knockout to Joshua in the fight before he won a world title in 2015.

Wilder wants to dispense with the interim fight and go right to a showdown with Joshua, which is easily the biggest heavyweight fight in boxing and maybe the biggest fight in the sport, period.

""A king don't chase the peasants,"" Wilder said. ""A king takes kings. I want Joshua. If he don't give me the fight we have other plans. Why should I go to England to fight a peasant without the king on the contract? The world want Joshua, the world want Wilder. I want Joshua. Joshua come and see me, baby.

""No more dodging, no more dodging, no more excuses. Make the date, don't wait. I'm too athletic. I told y'all I'm mobile, I'm hostile, I am the king, baby, and no heavyweight can compare to me. I'm very confident in what I do and tonight I showed that.""

Stiverne, fighting for only the second time in three years, showed up a portly 254.75 pounds and even though he outweighed Wilder by 34 pounds, it made no difference; he had nothing.

Nothing much happened in the first minute of the opening round, but then Wilder pounded his chest, walked to Stiverne and blasted him with a right hand to the head and knocked him down.

Stiverne beat the count, but Wilder marched to him again and nailed him with another right hand that floored him for the second time.

Mercante could have stopped the fight then, but he allowed it continue. It didn't last much longer, as Wilder (39-0, 38 KOs), 31, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, hammered Stiverne yet again. He unloaded a brutal four-punch combination -- right, left, right and another left as he was falling to the mat. Stiverne came to rest along the ropes, and Mercante immediately stopped it.

Stiverne looked totally out of it as he was moved to his stool.

""You gotta give props to Stiverne for getting in the ring,"" Wilder said. ""It takes a lot of courage, it takes a lot of pride to step in the ring with someone like me. We do what we gotta do in the ring and at least he stepped up. He was a clean fighter.""

According to CompuBox, Wilder, who earned $1.4 million, landed 15 of 39 punches (38 percent); Las Vegas-based Haiti native Stiverne (25-3-1, 21 KOs), who turned 39 this week, landed none of his four punches. For that, he was paid $506,250.

Stiverne had been the only man to go the distance with Wilder in their first fight, and the one motivation for Wilder in the rematch was the goal to knock him out.

Wilder would have preferred to face Ortiz (27-0, 23 KOs), but he tested positive for two banned diuretics (chlorothaizide, hydrochlorothiazide) in a random urine test conducted by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association on Sept. 22, and was dropped from the fight. He showed up ringside to watch Saturday night.

That left Wilder to face Stiverne, who was scheduled to fight on the undercard before being moved up to the main event."

(1:20)

Taking a spin around the NFL to get you ready for Week 9:

The big questions

Are the Eagles the Super Bowl favorites?

If the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Denver Broncos at home on Sunday, they will move to 8-1 for the fifth time in franchise history. The previous four times they started with that record, they either reached the Super Bowl (1980 and 2004) or the NFL's championship game in the years prior to the Super Bowl (1949 and 1960).

Of the 90 teams to start 8-1 or better in the Super Bowl era, 44 percent reached the title game and 24 percent won it.

As impressive as quarterback Carson Wentz has been in his second year -- 19 touchdowns, 5 interceptions and a 101.6 passer rating to throw himself into the MVP conversation -- he's gotten some help from his defense, too. The Eagles have been able to give him the chance to play with the lead. They haven't allowed a first-quarter touchdown all season, becoming the first team since the 2013 Carolina Panthers (who finished 12-4) to accomplish that through eight games.

When will the Packers win again?

The Green Bay Packers haven't won since quarterback Aaron Rodgers broke his right collarbone in Week 6 at the Minnesota Vikings. If they can't win in the next two weeks, then their best chance might not come until Dec. 10 at the Cleveland Browns.

They play on Monday Night Football at home against the Detroit Lions, who have are just 1-25 against the Packers in the state of Wisconsin since 1992. Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford is just 4-12 in prime-time games since 2009, and that includes a win earlier this season against the Giants. Stafford has the lowest winning percentage (.250) among starting quarterbacks in prime time in that stretch, worse than Kirk Cousins (.273, 3-8) and Andy Dalton (.294, 5-12).

Next week, the Packers will take on the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, where the Packers have won seven straight games (including playoffs). After that, it's the Baltimore Ravens at home, at the Pittsburgh Steelers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at home before they play the Browns.

Coach Mike McCarthy and Brett Hundley, Rodgers' replacement, had the bye last week to figure out what went wrong in Hundley's first start, a 26-17 home loss to the New Orleans Saints.

Are the Saints for real?

The Saints were on nobody's radar after they opened the season with losses to the Vikings and the New England Patriots, but they've been as impressive as anyone since then. If they beat the slumping Buccaneers on Sunday, they would become just the third team in the Super Bowl era to win at least six straight games after an 0-2 start.

The other teams to do it -- the 2007 New York Giants (who won six straight) and the 1993 Dallas Cowboys (seven straight) -- went on to win the Super Bowl.

The Saints' turnaround can be credited in part to their defense and in part to the quarterbacks they've faced. After allowing an average of 512.5 yards and 32.5 points in their first two games (when opposing quarterbacks threw six touchdowns and no interceptions), they've cut those numbers nearly by half. In the five-game winning streak, they've held opponents to 277.6 yards and 16.0 points per game (while opposing QBs have thrown just three touchdowns and nine interceptions).

However, they have not faced a quarterback in the top 15 in Total QBR during their win streak (they avoided facing Rodgers with the Packers two weeks ago). The opposing quarterback this week, Jameis Winston, ranks 24th in Total QBR.

Numbers that matter

16: Touchdown passes, without an interception, by Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith so far this season. He's the first quarterback to start each of the first eight games of a season without an interception since Jason Campbell in 2008. According to Elias Sports Bureau, the only quarterback in the Super Bowl era to go further into a season without an interception was Bernie Kosar, who started the first nine games of the 1991 Browns' season without throwing a pick. Smith's 16 touchdown passes are tied for the third most in league history before his first interception to start a season. Only Peyton Manning (20 in 2013) and Nick Foles (19 in 2013) have more.

19: Deshaun Watson's touchdown passes this season, the most by a player in his first seven NFL games. The Houston Texans rookie needed two more to match Kurt Warner for the most ever through eight games, according to Elias, but won't get the chance after he tore an ACL in practice Thursday. He also had a legitimate chance to set the record for most touchdown passes by a rookie -- a mark that stands at 26, first set by Manning in 1998 and then tied by Russell Wilson in 2012. Watson had thrown at least three touchdown passes in four straight games, an NFL rookie record. The last player, regardless of experience, to throw at least three TD passes in five straight games was Wilson in 2015.

30.3: The key to the Los Angeles Rams' turnaround? New coach Sean McVay's offense. At 30.3 points per game, they're second in the NFL to the Texans (30.7). The 2016 Rams ranked last in the league at 14.0 points per game.

26: Percent of the Seahawks' offensive yards that has come on the ground, the lowest-rushing percentage since Wilson became their starting quarterback. The last time the Seahawks went to the Super Bowl (the 2014 season), they led the league in percentage of yards gained via rushing.

1980: The last time the Giants started 1-7, a mark they would equal with a loss at home to the Rams. Ben McAdoo's team is 0-3 at home this season, one of only three teams that hasn't won at home. The others -- Cleveland (0-5) and San Francisco (0-3) -- haven't won anywhere this season.

What we'll be talking about after Week 9

The Cowboys as a contender or pretender

Sunday's game against the 6-2 Chiefs could say a lot about the Cowboys (4-3). According to ESPN's Football Power Index, Dallas has a 43 percent chance to make the playoffs as things stand now. That would increase to a 51 percent chance with a win Sunday, but would fall to 31 percent with a loss. The Cowboys have made the playoffs only twice in the Super Bowl era when they did not have a winning record through eight games (in 1999 and 2006 after 4-4 starts).

The Raiders as a contender or pretender

There's even more pressure on the Oakland Raiders to turn things around. They started 2-0 and had a 66 percent chance to make the playoffs at that point, according to the FPI. After losing five of their past six games, they now have only a 4 percent chance to make the playoffs. A loss at the offensively inept Miami Dolphins would drop the Raiders to 3-6. Nothing has come easy for Oakland on the road, where they have lost four of their past five (including three straight).

The start of the Jimmy Garoppolo era

Although coach Kyle Shanahan and GM John Lynch said they plan to take it slow with their new quarterback, if C.J. Beathard continues the trend of poor quarterback play in San Francisco, perhaps they'll be compelled to go to Garoppolo sooner rather than later. The 49ers rank in the bottom five of the NFL in most major passing categories -- completion percentage (56 percent, 31st), yards per attempt (6.0, 29th), touchdown-to-interception ratio (0.86, 29th) and Total QBR (28.3, 30th). If they fall to 0-9 with a loss to the Arizona Cardinals, perhaps they'll turn things over to the former Patriots backup next week."

Gaston Ramirez and Fabio Quagliarella both scored from Duvan Zapata assists, as Sampdoria plunged rivals Genoa into crisis with a 2-0 result.

Grifone Coach Ivan Juric is at serious risk of the sack now, having slipped into the bottom three and lost the third consecutive Derby della Lanterna.

The ‘hosts’ paid a heavy price for poor finishing, particularly with Gianluca Lapadula, whereas Colombia international Duvan Zapata was decisive.

His flick sent Ramirez through to dink the opener over Mattia Perin, then late on he drew the goalkeeper out to roll across for Quagliarella.

Sampdoria have 23 points from 11 games and still have a match in hand to be played against Roma.

By Football Italia staff

Ivan Juric admits “the possibility of dismissal was in the air” before Genoa’s 2-0 defeat to Sampdoria. “I accept whatever comes next.”

The Grifone were already in crisis before this defeat to their local rivals, sitting in the bottom three with only six points, but are now 17 points behind Samp, having played an extra game.

It was reported Juric would be axed if he failed to win the Derby della Lanterna.

“The situation was in the air, I haven’t received any call, but I do want to say the lads put in a performance of great heart, determination and commitment.

“I thank them for their attitude, we played the way we wanted to, especially in the second half, and created so many scoring opportunities.

“Sampdoria have a little more confidence, as is inevitable, but we conceded the first goal in just ridiculous circumstances. We hit the crossbar and missed two great chances with Gianluca Lapadula, so the team fought hard and did create its chances.

“We had a lot more than Samp physically in the last 30 minutes. Goran Pandev always shakes things up, although he can’t always do the whole 90 minutes, but we had the chances throughout.

“We allowed Samp very little and knew we could struggle with their passing, but they never really hurt us that way. I still maintain the opening goal was the kind we should not be conceding in a derby – or in Serie A, for that matter.

“I don’t know what will happen now, as the possibility of dismissal was in the air, but the team is growing and I cannot complain about their attitude. Sometimes football is ruthless, it can turn against you, but this team has quality and is full of great guys. I accept whatever comes next.

“I realise the results are not good, but I will not criticise my lads for their performances, their attitude or even their training sessions.

“Will Genoa stay in Serie A? Certainly! With Juric on the bench? I don’t know, you’d have to ask the club.”

Darko Lazovic was introduced as a substitute then replaced half-an-hour later by Pietro Pellegri.

“I wanted to introduce another striker, but let’s not beat around the bush here, he made a lot of mistakes. He wasted a lot of crosses when it was three against two in the box and misplaced passes.”

By Football Italia staff

Simone Zaza gave credit to his Valencia teammates after earning his first Italy call-up in a year for the World Cup qualifier against Sweden.

The striker has found the net nine times in 11 Liga games this season and was included in Giampiero Ventura’s squad.

“I am truly happy for the call-up,” Zaza told the official Valencia website.

“It’s not down to me, but the credit goes to the whole squad. Without my teammates at Valencia, all this could not have happened.

“We are doing well and they always put me in the ideal conditions to score goals. When the call arrived, I was in the locker room and my teammates were really happy for me. We are a united squad, a group of friends.

“I want to enjoy this moment and help my country.”

Italy must get past Sweden to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

The first leg is in Stockholm on November 10, with the decider at San Siro in Milan on November 13.

By Football Italia staff

Davide Ballardini is the favourite to take over if Genoa sack Ivan Juric, ahead of Massimo Oddo and Walter Mazzarri.

The Grifone are stuck in the relegation zone after just six points from 12 Serie A rounds, including Saturday’s 2-0 defeat to local rivals Sampdoria.

Juric confessed in his post-match comments that “the possibility of dismissal was already in the air” and a decision is expected tomorrow morning.

According to Sky Sport Italia, the favourite to replace Juric is Ballardini, who has already come to Genoa’s rescue twice before.

He arrived in place of Gian Piero Gasperini in November 2010 to finish the season in 10th place, but was not kept on by President Enrico Preziosi.

Ballardini took over from Gigi Del Neri in January 2013 and ensured safety, but again clashed with Preziosi over the transfer strategy.

Other candidates for the Genoa bench now are ex-Pescara Coach Oddo and former Watford, Inter and Napoli tactician Mazzarri.

By Football Italia staff

Marco Giampaolo praised Duvan Zapata, but reveals he almost missed Sampdoria’s 2-0 win over Genoa due to surgery this week.

The Blucerchiati won the Derby della Lanterna for the third time running, a record equalling those set in 2003 and 1953.

They are now an incredible 17 points clear of their local rivals, with a game in hand, and are now pushing for a European place.

It has been a difficult week for Giampaolo, who was in hospital for an operation to remove kidney stones and only got to watch the training sessions yesterday.

“I feared that I wouldn’t be here tonight, but I thank the medical staff. It would’ve been terrible to miss out on this spectacle,” the Coach told Mediaset Premium.

“You make mistakes, try to fix them and never stop learning. Often the responsibility is placed on the Coach, but players can enrich a tactician’s ideas and create something you didn’t expect.

“At half-time, I told my players they were a bit too tense and we could’ve passed it around better. In terms of passing, it was probably our worst performance and we stayed in it with sheer determination. It was a big game for our campaign, as it’s the derby and for confidence, but we could’ve played better.”

Duvan Zapata provided the assists for both Gaston Ramirez and Fabio Quagliarella goals this evening.

“We have different options now. Last season there was no point lifting the ball with the characteristics of the forwards, but now Duvan Zapata is both good in the air and can also run, dribble and power his way through. He gives us different solutions and at times we can play in a different way.

“Zapata came here when he hadn’t even been through pre-season training, but he is a fine professional, works hard and says very little. I just have to put him on the pitch.”

How well could this Sampdoria have done if they had kept Luis Muriel, Patrik Schick, Bruno Fernandes and Milan Skriniar?

“Years change, motivation changes and we can’t say what those players would’ve done here this season. Unfortunately, Schick hasn’t been able to play yet, but the others all proved themselves great talents at their new clubs.

“I don’t set objectives other than to improve ourselves. The team had 43 points last term and there’s no point setting your sights on specific targets that don’t really help the situation. We just want to do as well as possible, that’s all we need.”

By Football Italia staff

Fabio Quagliarella relished his first goal in the Derby della Lanterna, as Sampdoria beat Genoa in an “incredible atmosphere.”

Gaston Ramirez opened the scoring in the first half before Quagliarella put the final nail in the Grifone coffin late on for a 2-0 result.

“I had never scored in the derby before. The atmosphere was incredible and I am happy to have broken that drought with a victory,” Quagliagol told Mediaset Premium.

“At the end of the day, the result is deserved, as we saw a great Sampdoria performance.”

The Blucerchiati have 23 points from 11 rounds, with a game in hand, only one below Roma, so are they aiming for European qualification?

“Objectives aren’t to be discussed now, we are only at the start of November and there’s too long to go. Let’s put the points on the board first and then see.”

Quagliarella has contributed to six goals in his last five games for Sampdoria, netting half of them, so should he be getting a call-up for the Nazionale?

“It’s only right that for the Italy squad we see young players, but it’s nice to know I’m still delivering the goods.”

By Football Italia staff

Simone Inzaghi is without Felipe Caicedo and possibly also Ciro Immobile against Udinese, but wants Lazio to find a 10th straight win.

It kicks off on Sunday at 14.00 GMT, click here for a match preview.

The Biancocelesti are on sparkling form, losing only one competitive match, sitting third in Serie A and the only side to have a perfect Europa League record.

“We have an important game and one that is by no means easy, as Udinese are in good shape and coming off two consecutive victories,” said Inzaghi in his Press conference.

“They are motivated, feeling confident and consolidated their position after a difficult start to the season. We need to win at all costs.

“I know Gigi Del Neri well and Udinese are going to play a very physical game. It’s important for us to keep the run going to 10 straight wins in all competition.”

Immobile remains in doubt after missing Thursday’s 1-0 Europa League victory over Nice with a muscular issue.

“He still has a few problems, but did take part in training yesterday. We’ll evaluate the situation, as he is an extremely important player who only missed one game under my tenure and that was through suspension. He did seem better this morning.

“If Immobile doesn’t start, then something will certainly change in the tactics, as we’d be playing without our reference point in attack.

“Felipe Caicedo had a problem on Thursday and will be out for two to three weeks. I have Luis Nani who can adapt to more or less any situation, so we’ll see.”

Lazio also need to be extra careful around Immobile so close to Italy’s World Cup play-offs against Sweden on November 10 and 13.

“Immobile is 27 years old, so he knows his own body and what it can do. Naturally, all Italians hope he can lead Italy to the World Cup.

“Lazio are no longer a surprise. We want to confirm our status from last season and the current campaign, to keep improving and realise this is not the end point.”

By Football Italia staff

Roberto Donadoni said Bologna only have themselves to blame for the 3-2 home defeat to Crotone, after twice taking the lead.

The Rossoblu had gone into the break 2-1 up thanks to a pair of Simone Verdi free kicks – one with his left foot, one with his right – but were overcome by an Ante Budimir double and Marcello Trotta penalty.

“We can’t concede three goals like that. It was our own fault,” the Coach told Sky Sport Italia.

“We lost a match that seemed impossible to lose. At the end of the day, Crotone had three shots on goal and maybe one other chance, but that was it. We should’ve been more determined to get the result.”

Remarkably, Bologna had won three on the bounce before this run of four straight defeats.

“I don’t believe the compliments for the positive start to the season got to us. I know that, aside from the free kicks, Verdi can give more and he realises that too.”

In his new book, LA NY, Milstein photographs two of the biggest and well-known cities in the United States, Los Angeles and New York, from above.

Milstein got his pilots license at age 17. He would fly around LA with an 8mm movie camera and film out the window. Six years ago, he turned his passion for shooting from above into a profession.

""I switched into photography from being an architect and a CEO of a company that I had started in the 80s,"" said Milstein. ""I ended up gravitating toward things that I liked—particularly aviation. I did a series of aircrafts shot from underneath when they were landing. And after doing that I started thinking, what other things could be interesting? So I decided to shoot giant cruise ships from the air. Then I did airports and then cities.""

Milstein uses a combination of helicopters and his own Cessna 182 plane to get the shots. With a pilot and a high resolution camera mounted to a stabilizing gyro, Milstein is able to lean out of the aircraft and see the shapes and patterns of the world. The lower shots are done from the helicopter and the higher ones with the small airplane.

""It's kind of an interest I've always had—how the world looks from above,"" he says. I like to see how things connect. It's sort of like you get an understating of the world in a different way, from above."" He has shot above iconic buildings (including the Empire State Building), the Hollywood sign, residential and commercial neighborhoods, airports , parks, and cargo ships .

In addition to Los Angeles and New York, Milstein has also shot over London, Miami, and New Jersey (Milstein shot a Fortune 500 issue cover in June, 2016 highlighting the success of home builder NVR homes in Northern New Jersey). He hopes Paris will be next.

Being an architect has certainly given him a view of the world that some people don't see. ""When flying across the country I like to look out the window and see the geography and the layout of the city and how it connects to farmlands, and the trains, and where they put their airports. I find it fascinating to think about how cities have formed.""

LA NY, published by Thames & Hudson , will be available on November 7th. Milstein will also be having a talk and a book signing on Wednesday, November 8th at Foto Care in New York.

The United boss has already managed that total, while the likes of Pep Guardiola (21), Antonio Conte (six), Jurgen Klopp (five) and Mauricio Pochettino (none) are yet to do so.

Wenger's men face the impressive and unbeaten Premier League leaders at the Etihad Stadium Sunday.

City have been dominant this season, holding a five-point advantage at the top after scoring 35 goals and conceding just six in 10 league games.

Led by the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and Sergio Aguero, Pep Guardiola's attack has starred, but Wenger feels Ozil – often criticised for his relaxed displays – can match City's best.

""I think so – every big player wants to play big games and this is a big game,"" the Frenchman told UK newspapers, via The Telegraph.

""Ozil at the moment is in very good shape physically. People speak about Alexis Sanchez but, for us, Ozil's performance will be important as well.

""He contributes a lot to the way we play. He can be an asset every time we attack because he's a guy who can create chances.""

Arsenal sit fifth in the table, with Ozil contributing one goal and two assists in eight Premier League games this season.

But the Germany international has created 30 chances – equal with De Bruyne for the most in the league and two more than Silva."

""The most important club in the world is Tottenham,"" he told UK newspapers. ""And it is the best club in the world.

""I need to feel like this and that emotion is real because I cannot be fake. It's too difficult to create the trust if you don't really believe and it's not real, that emotion.

Pochettino extended his Spurs contract in May last year, signing on with the Premier League side until 2021.

The former Espanyol and Southampton boss also talked up his relationship with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy.

""Before I arrived to Tottenham, everyone said to me, 'It's so difficult to have a very good relationship with Daniel'. And after, I discovered a great man,"" Pochettino said.

Alcacer, starting in Spain's top flight for the first time since the match against Real Betis on the opening day of the season, scored twice at Camp Nou on Saturday.

Those goals gave Barca a valuable 2-1 victory which ensures they go into the international break with a four-point lead over closest challengers Valencia, having won 10 and drawn one of their first 11 league games.

""He got two important goals and we hope that they give him the confidence that strikers need,"" Valverde said at his post-match media conference.

""We are happy with him and for the team. He has not played a lot and he has shown that he is a goalscorer and we are happy.

""I have a strong side here and anyone can come in and score. It is to the credit of the player that he can come in with the pressure on and perform.""

Alcacer was denied the chance of a hat-trick, though, as he was immediately substituted by Valverde after his 65th-minute winner.

""He was having a very good game but also looked tired,"" explained Valverde.

""The [wide] position he was playing in was very demanding. He is a player who does not play too much and was making a great effort.""

Barca's win means they are a huge 11 points clear of champions Real Madrid, who host Las Palmas on Sunday in their game in hand.

Valverde added: ""At the moment we are leaders, we are not making mistakes and we will go into this international break in good spirits.

""We have a difficult fixture list ahead and to continue where we are then we have to be strong.""

Barca's fine form comes amid a time of intense political uncertainty in Catalonia, with the region now under direct rule from Spain after a disputed independence referendum.

""What we are seeing is that it does not affect us,"" said Valverde.

""People come to the Camp Nou to express themselves freely in a peaceful way and above all to support the team. We focus on playing and winning."""

The French champions are four points off the pace at the top of the table despite Saturday's 6-0 demolition of Guingamp, with PSG winning 5-0 at Angers earlier in the day.

Monaco welcome Unai Emery's men to the principality at the end of the month but Jardim is not thinking that far ahead.

""After 12 matches, Paris are above the others; behind, there are good teams,"" the Monaco coach said after this latest victory. ""We have maintained our level.

""But I am not thinking about Paris now. The gap is at four points - it will be a very important match to get to one point. But first, we have to win at Amiens.""

Uruguay international Cavani has flourished since Zlatan Ibrahimovic's departure from Parc des Princes, topping the scoring charts with 35 league strikes in 2016-17.

The striker looks set to reach a similar total this season with a double in the 5-0 thumping of Angers on Saturday putting him on 13 after 11 Ligue 1 outings this season – level with Radamel Falcao.

But Cavani assures he is more interested in team success than establishing himself as one of PSG's all-time greats.

""I try to give everything for my team. Football is like that. Today we are here, but after we don't know,"" said Cavani.

""I give the maximum. If things go well, I'm happy for myself, for the team, for the club, for the fans.

PSG were without Neymar against Angers, but Kylian Mbappe also scored twice and Julian Draxler added the other.

Free-scoring Premier League leaders City will aim to improve their record of nine wins and a draw from 10 top-flight games when they host Arsenal on Sunday.

A 4-2 triumph at Napoli to secure qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek gave the latest demonstration of the stunning attacking array at Guardiola's disposal.

Raheem Sterling netted his 10th of the season and Sergio Aguero became City's all-time leading scorer as Leroy Sane excelled against the Serie A table-toppers.

But ahead of an encounter with Arsene Wenger's side that promises to be another feast of attacking football, Guardiola took time to praise a vital defensive cog in his side.

Sitting at the base of City's midfield, Fernandinho's superb form this term has been vital to implementing the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss' desired style of building from the back and allowing the creative talents of Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva to wreak havoc.

Guardiola performed with distinction in the same position for Barca during his playing days and has coached masters of the art such as Sergio Busquets and Xabi Alonso. He feels City's 32-year-old Brazil international measures up to the very best.

""I think that Fernandinho right now is one of the best - best, best, best - three holding midfielders in the world,"" he said.

""The same as with [defenders] John [Stones] and Nico [Otamendi], Fernandinho has achieved another level with his positivity and mentality.

""He gives us a lot – with the ball and without the ball, in terms of many things that we need to compete.

""Last season we cannot forget that Fernandinho played at full-back many, many times and made no complaints.

""He tried and asked always what he had done and how he could improve. When you have a lot of players in a squad with that mentality you can dream to win games.""

Those dreams are becoming a reality with an almost inevitable frequency for Guardiola at present, leaving the 46-year-old to temper expectations around his in-form side.

Having already batted back questions over matching Arsenal's 2003-04 'Invincibles' by going through a Premier League season unbeaten, the Catalan insisted dreaming of a Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble would be a ""big mistake"".

""Winning the treble is an exceptional situation,"" said Guardiola, who achieved the feat in 2008-09 with Barcelona – crowning a remarkable maiden season as a senior coach.

""Barcelona did it twice, [Manchester] United, a long time ago Celtic, Inter Milan with Jose [Mourinho] – I think it is an exceptional situation.

""I think, for English football, all five teams will go to the last 16 in the Champions League. That is the first real good step.

""That is the best news compared to the previous years for English football. After that we will see.

""There are five teams there – more chance to win the Champions League, doubles, maybe trebles.

""But I think winning trebles is an exceptional situation today, like it was before in our period in Barcelona.

""Bayern Munich won the treble with Jupp Heynckes [in 2012-13] – a top team in Europe and that is the only treble in their history, even in the era of [Franz] Beckenbauer, Uli Hoeness and [Karl-Heinz] Rummenigge.

""I think it is a big mistake to think 'we are going to win the treble'. Beat Arsenal and after that we will see."""

Conte's compatriot Claudio Ranieri led relegation-tipped Leicester City from 5,000-1 outsiders at the start of the season to the summit of English football, completing one of the most remarkable upset stories in sports history.

Chelsea, as they are now, were defending champions that season but their form nosedived terribly, Jose Mourinho was sacked and they finished in 10th.

Conte currently finds his position under scrutiny, with Chelsea nine points shy of Premier League leaders Manchester City ahead of second-place Manchester United visiting Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

But the former Juventus and Italy boss suggested his feat in taking the Blues back to the title from their brief existence as also-rans does not receive due credit.

""Don't forget that in the last four or five years we lost a lot of important players for Chelsea – [Didier] Drogba, Petr Cech, [Frank] Lampard, [John] Terry, [Branislav] Ivanovic, [John Obi] Mikel, [Nemanja] Matic,"" Conte said, returning to a familiar theme of Chelsea's squad depth presenting a challenge on their return to the Champions League – something seemingly borne out by a 3-0- loss at Roma in midweek.

Asked to compare his own title win to that achieved by his friend Ranieri, who found himself out of a job by this February, Conte said: ""I think Leicester did a great miracle because when usually you are used to fighting relegation [winning the league] is a miracle, a big miracle.

""For Chelsea, who are used to winning the league in the past, also you have to understand when it is a good time to win the league or when it is a surprise.

""If this is a surprise, it means you are doing a miracle. I think last season was a miracle for us.

""Chelsea's name sometimes covers the miracle, only because your name is Chelsea. When you finish 10th you have the opposite of the miracle.""

He added: ""It was a miracle, because we had the same players that the season before finished 10th.

""Okay our transfer market was good with [Michy] Batshuayi, [David] Luiz, [N'Golo] Kante and [Marcos] Alonso.

""If I don't remember badly, you [the media] were the first to say Chelsea is prepared to become worse than the previous season.

""I remember the headlines. I have to say when I make mistakes but also you have to do the same.""

Despite Conte's contention that Chelsea are fighting for honours at home and abroad while in the midst of a rebuilding phase, he does not feel the need to ask Roman Abramovich and his board for more time should the champions hit a prolonged mid-season slump.

""Honestly, I think I earned my time here with the win of last season. I earned my time,"" said the 48-year-old, who signed improved terms before the start of this season that did not extend the length of his contract beyond 2019.

""I don't like to ask for time. I like to tell the truth. My task is to work and to put all myself for this club.

The move comes just days after Saudi Arabia held a major investment conference to drum up interest in that effort.

The arrest, which was part of a sweep that included at least 10 other princes as well as current and former ministers, came just hours after the creation of a new anti-corruption committee by King Salman, who gave it broad powers to freeze the assets of anyone it considers corrupt.

Prince Alwaleed made early bets on some of the tech world’s biggest stars, also including Snap, riding a boom that has catapulted many young entrepreneurs to top the rich lists, and earned him handsome returns. Prince Alwaleed also made an early bet on JD.com, a Chinese online retailer, anticipating that country’s emergence as a vast e-commerce market.

In moments of corporate crises, Prince Alwaleed has stepped in to tip the balance.

When the phone hacking scandal rocked a London tabloid owned by the Murdochs, the prince went on the BBC to say that Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive officer of the British unit of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation, had to resign. “You bet she has to go,” he said in July 2011. She resigned the next day.

At the time, Prince Alwaleed was the second-biggest shareholder in News Corporation, with a more than 6 percent stake. He later sold most of his stake in the company. He also owns a stake in 21st Century Fox, which was a part of News Corporation until it was spun off into a separate listed company in 2013. The prince played a leading role in the shareholder vote to split the two companies, as the second most powerful shareholder behind the Murdoch family.

In the darkest hours of the 2008 financial crisis, Prince Alwaleed said he would increase his stake in Citigroup, in a move of solidarity with the then-embattled bank’s chief executive officer, Vikram S. Pandit.

Later, when Mr. Pandit faced a rebuke from angry shareholders over a 2012 pay package that totaled $15 million, the prince said he voted for it, according to a recent interview in Vanity Fair.

Prince Alwaleed has worked closely with some of Wall Street’s biggest and best known banks and investors.

Just a month ago, Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs, sat across from Prince Alwaleed at a meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The two talked about investments and economic developments in the Middle East. A longtime banker for Kingdom Holding, Goldman Sachs recently helped Prince Alwaleed’s company acquire a 16 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi, the Saudi bank.

When he traveled to New York in 2016, Prince Alwaleed met with Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Bloomberg. After a meeting, Mr. Bloomberg agreed to support news programming on the Alarab News Channel, a venture that Prince Alwaleed owns privately.

Kingdom Holdings has played a role in top leadership at AccorHotels, in which it has a 5.8 percent stake. A recent news release showed pictures of Prince Alweleed laughing with former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who was asked to join the board of the French hotel chain earlier this year.

The arrest could shake confidence in Saudi Arabia as it tries to diversify its economy. The kingdom is planning to list the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco next year in what is expected to be the biggest initial public offering in history.

President Trump waves to U.S. military personnel after giving an address at Yokota Air Base in Fussa, Tokyo Prefecture, Japan on Nov. 5. Trump arrived in the outskirts of Tokyo on the first leg of his 12-day Asian tour, during which he will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam. (Kimimasa Mayama/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)

TOKYO — President Trump donned a military-style bomber jacket shortly after arriving in Japan on Sunday and projected confidence that the United States will confront threats in Asia, telling hundreds of U.S. troops that they will have the resources ""to fight, to overpower and to always, always, always win.""

Trump's tough talk in a speech to U.S. and Japanese military personnel at Yokota Air Base, shortly after Air Force One touched down here, aimed to set a tone for his five-nation tour during which the president said he is likely to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a regional summit in Vietnam later this week.

The president told reporters during his flight that he wants ""Putin's help on North Korea,"" as his administration attempts to consolidate support for its strategy to pressure Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons program.

“History has proven over and over that the road of the tyrant is a steady march towards poverty, suffering and servitude,"" Trump told the troops, perhaps referring obliquely to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, whose name he did not mention. Noting that he has proposed a bigger military budget, Trump surveyed the troops in an air base hangar and declared: ""We've got a lot of stuff coming; use it well.""

The boisterous scene, during which the troops cheered and chanted ""U.S.A.!"" was probably closely watched in capitals across Northeast Asia, where governments from Seoul to Beijing are looking for signals of how Trump will address the threat on his first trip to the region. The president's heightened rhetoric aimed at the North and the Kim regime has set the region on edge over concerns that increasing tensions could result in a military confrontation.

[Trump heads to Asia where concerns are growing over possible war with North Korea]

On the plane, Trump told reporters that he plans to decide “very soon” whether to re-label North Korea a state sponsor of terror. The North spent 10 years on that list before being removed in 2008 by the George W. Bush administration for meeting nuclear inspection requirements. Pyongyang later violated the agreement.

But Trump also offered encouragement for North Korean citizens, calling them “great people.”

“They’re industrious, they’re warm, much warmer than the world really knows and understands,” he told reporters on the plane. “They’re great people and I hope it all works out for everybody. And it would be a wonderful thing if it could work for those great people, and for everybody.”

And he seemed unconcerned about the prospect that North Korea might use his trip to the region to demonstrate its military might by firing a missile. “We’ll soon find out,” he said. “Good luck!”

After speaking at the air base, Trump was scheduled to spend the day with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, including nine holes of golf and a dinner. At the golf course, the two signed white baseball caps with the embroidered words: ""Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater."" On Monday, the two will hold formal bilateral meetings.

The golf outing aimed to recreate the bond the two men forged during Abe's visit in February to Trump's Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, where they played a round. It was while the two leaders dined together that evening that Kim launched a missile test, prompting an angry condemnation from both men at a joint statement to reporters in Florida.

Trump, who had spent Saturday night in Honolulu and toured Pearl Harbor, seemed in buoyant spirits Sunday. He wore an unbuttoned, open-collared white shirt with no tie to chat with the press on Air Force One, and he enthusiastically donned the brown leather bomber jacket presented to him by Air Force officers at Yokota. ""I like this better,"" he joked, after replacing his navy blue suit coat.

[Four reasons Trump’s Asia trip is so important]

Trump confirmed that he expects to meet with Putin on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, later in the trip. The meeting would come as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia has heated up. Last week, Mueller indicted three people in Trump’s orbit — two senior campaign aides and one lower-level, unpaid volunteer — as part of his ongoing investigation.

But the president, who has often expressed admiration for authoritarian leaders, has remained reluctant to criticize Putin.

The president also promised that trade will also be a key focus of his trip, with China — a frequent target of his trade-related ire — looming largest on the economic front. Chinese President Xi Jinping consolidated power last month at the 19th Communist Party Congress, and Trump is preparing to face a newly emboldened Xi on his home turf.

“I think we’re going in with tremendous strength,"" Trump said. When a reporter asked him about Xi’s elevated position, the president cut off the questioner, saying, “Excuse me, so am I.”

He then rattled off a laundry list of highlights of U.S. power, including the surging stock market, low unemployment and success in combating the Islamic State in the Middle East.

“I think he’s viewing us as very, very strong, and also very friendly,” Trump said. “But we have to do better with trade with China because it’s a one-way street right now and it has been for many years. And we will. But the reason our stock market is so successful is because of me. I’ve always been great with money, I’ve always been great with jobs, that’s what I do.”

Trump noted that he will spend the first anniversary of Election Day 2016 in China, and facetiously invited his traveling press corps to join him in the festivities. “Can you believe it is almost exactly one year? We’re going to be in China — together,” he said. “We’ll have to celebrate together, Nov. 8. I hope we’ll all celebrate together. In fact, I was going to have a big celebration party, and then I said, ‘Well.’ But we’ll celebrate together.”

Asked about a new book about former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, in which they sharply criticize Trump, the president showed uncharacteristic restraint.

“The Bushes? I’ll comment after we come back,” he said. “I don’t need headlines. I don’t want to make their book successful.”"

About 12 strikes were heard hitting the defense ministry downtown and other targets mostly on the city outskirts. The exchange of fire took place on a day when the region was on edge over the growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Earlier, the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, resigned from a unity government that includes Iran’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah. Speaking from Riyadh, he blamed Iran for interfering in Arab affairs. Iran and Hezbollah read the move as pressure from Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hariri’s patron, to isolate them as part of a campaign to curb Iranian influence.

The Yemeni defense ministry has claimed several times to have fired a Burqan 2 missile at Saudi Arabia, which has acknowledged at least one previous strike.

Residents and travelers in Riyadh reported a loud explosion on Saturday. The Twitter account of King Khalid International Airport issued a message saying airport operations had not been affected.

Videos from the scene showed people rushing to airport windows, smoke and what appeared to be flashes or fires on the ground.

One showed red flares rising toward the sky.

Some pro-Saudi commenters in Yemen and Saudi media suggested that the Houthis could have fired the missiles on behalf of Iran or Hezbollah.

Military analysts at IHS Jane’s have written that the Houthis’ emerging use of ballistic missiles offers some support for American, Saudi and Israeli allegations that Iran is aiding them with parts or technology, but add that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen. Another possibility, the analysts say, is that the missiles were acquired by Yemen from North Korea before the current conflict.

In Sana, jets were heard overhead and residents reported airstrikes. Ali Hassan, a taxi driver, said that roads leading to the defense ministry downtown were closed by the police.

“I saw smoke rising from the ministry,” he said, adding that he also saw an airstrike in another area where a weapon depot was located.

The ministry is in a densely populated area, a World Heritage site known as Bab al-Yemen, which has been targeted before. Saudi-led coalition jets could be heard over Sana. The bulk of airstrikes in retaliation reportedly targeted the outskirts of Sana.

The Houthis’ news channel, Al-Masirah, said on Twitter: “We repeatedly affirmed that capitals of aggression states won’t be spared from our ballistic missiles in retaliation for the constant targeting of innocent civilians.”"

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is recovering after being assaulted at his Kentucky home Friday, joining a growing list of lawmakers who have been injured or threatened with violence this year.

Paul, a second-term senator, suffered a minor injury when he was assaulted at his Warren County, Ky., home Friday afternoon. Kelsey Cooper, Paul’s ­Kentucky-based communications director, said in a statement Saturday that the senator “was blindsided and the victim of an assault. The assailant was arrested, and it is now a matter for the police.”

It was unclear whether politics was a motivation for the attack, according to a senior aide to the senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the aide was not authorized to speak about the incident.

Kentucky State Police charged 59-year-old Rene Boucher with fourth-degree assault with a minor injury. He is being held at Warren County jail on $5,000 bond, state police said.

Boucher is an anesthesiologist and the inventor of the Therm-a-Vest, a cloth vest partially filled with rice and secured with Velcro straps that is designed to help with back pain, according to the Bowling Green Daily News.

Troopers responded to Paul’s residence at 3:21 p.m. Friday after reports of an assault. Upon arrival, troops determined that Boucher “had intentionally assaulted Paul, causing a minor injury,” state police said.

Robert Porter, who has known the senator and his family for more than 20 years, said he went to see his friend Saturday evening. He would not specify where or how the senator was injured but said Paul “didn’t get any severe injuries to his face.”

“He’s in some pain, but he’s going to be fine,” Porter said, adding that Paul’s return to Washington will be a “game-time decision” but that Paul is planning to return to work at some point in the coming days.

Paul and Boucher live in the same gated community along Rivergreen Lane in Bowling Green, Ky., according to Porter and another person close to Paul who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of respect for the senator.

Porter said Paul was mowing his lawn and wearing ear plugs Friday afternoon just before the alleged assault. Shortly after stepping off the riding mower to do something in the yard, Paul “got blindsided. He didn’t hear him or see his neighbor come over,” Porter said.

“He hadn’t really talked to his neighbor in years,” Porter said, noting that there is a large amount of land between their adjoining homes, so the lack of interaction would not be surprising to locals.

Porter said he was unaware of any previous incidents between Paul and his neighbor.

Porter said that he and Paul and their spouses raised their kids together. He also traveled with the senator to Guatemala in 2014 as part of a missionary trip to provide free eye care to hundreds of impoverished patients.

Paul, 54, has served in the Senate since 2011. He is an ophthalmologist who has practiced in Bowling Green, Ky., where he moved with his wife in 1993.

He ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, focusing the closing months of his bid on attacking then-candidate Donald Trump and his readiness for office.

In recent months, he was a lead opponent of Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

But more recently, Paul has emerged as a leading defender of Trump’s policies and has golfed with the president at Trump’s Virginia golf course.

Porter said he didn’t know whether Paul and Boucher had ever worked together at local medical facilities.

A Facebook page purportedly used by Boucher says he is a former U.S. Army pain management specialist and graduated from the College of Osteopathic Medicine in Des Moines in 1984. The page also includes links to articles or memes critical of Trump and a news article about a Montana Republican congressional candidate who attacked a reporter the day before winning his seat.

The page was overrun late Saturday by other Facebook users criticizing Boucher for his alleged assault on Paul.

While it is unclear whether the attack was politically motivated, an unprecedented wave of threats against House and Senate lawmakers this year has prompted congressional security officials to review and follow up on thousands of threatening messages to members of both parties.

The threats turned to violence this summer when House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was shot and nearly killed by a gunman who showed up at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Va.

More recently, Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) skipped several days of votes after threats were made against her after she sparred with Trump over the treatment of the widow of a soldier killed in Niger.

In addition to Scalise, Paul and Wilson, Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) has faced threats since suggesting that Trump should face impeachment. And several GOP lawmakers, including Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.), have faced threats. Rubio, another failed 2016 presidential candidate, was spotted in July walking around the U.S. Capitol with three U.S. Capitol Police officers wearing suits and ties.

As interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, Brazile was not empowered to replace her unilaterally. Reactions from former Clinton campaign officials have also been added.

Former Democratic National Committee head Donna Brazile writes in a new book that she seriously contemplated setting in motion a process to replace Hillary Clinton as the party’s 2016 presidential nominee with then-Vice President Biden in the aftermath of Clinton’s fainting spell, in part because Clinton’s campaign was “anemic” and had taken on “the odor of failure.”

In an explosive new memoir, Brazile details widespread dysfunction and dissension throughout the Democratic Party, including secret deliberations over using her powers as interim DNC chair to initiate the process of removing Clinton and running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) from the ticket after Clinton’s Sept. 11, 2016, collapse in New York City.

Brazile writes that she considered a dozen combinations to replace the nominees and settled on Biden and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), the duo she felt most certain would win over enough working-class voters to defeat Republican Donald Trump. But then, she writes, “I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them.”

Brazile paints a scathing portrait of Clinton as a well-intentioned, historic candidate whose campaign was badly mismanaged, took minority constituencies for granted and made blunders with “stiff” and “stupid” messages. The campaign was so lacking in passion for the candidate, she writes, that its New York headquarters felt like a sterile hospital ward where “someone had died.”

Brazile alleges that Clinton’s top aides routinely disrespected her and put the DNC on a “starvation diet,” depriving it of funding for voter turnout operations.

As one of her party’s most prominent black strategists, Brazile also recounts fiery disagreements with Clinton’s staffers — including a conference call in which she told three senior campaign officials, Charlie Baker, Marlon Marshall and Dennis Cheng, that she was being treated like a slave.

“I’m not Patsey the slave,” Brazile recalls telling them, a reference to the character played by Lupita Nyong’o in the film, “12 Years a Slave.” “Y’all keep whipping me and whipping me and you never give me any money or any way to do my damn job. I am not going to be your whipping girl!”

Cheng, the campaign’s national finance director, did not participate in this call, according to a senior Clinton campaign official.

[Democrats express outrage over allegations of early party control for Clinton]

Brazile’s book, titled “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House,” will be released Tuesday by Hachette Books. A copy of the 288-page book was obtained in advance by The Washington Post.

Former Clinton campaign officials strongly disputed some details in Brazile's account as well as her overall characterization of the campaign, and they disparaged her memoir as an effort to sell books and manufacture drama.

More than 100 former senior aides issued an open letter Saturday night reading, “We do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.

“We were shocked to learn the news that Donna Brazile actively considered overturning the will of the Democratic voters by attempting to replace Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine as the Democratic Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees,” the letter began. “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate's health.”

Perhaps not since George Stephanopoulos wrote “All Too Human,” a 1999 memoir of his years working for former president Bill Clinton, has a political strategist penned such a blistering tell-all.

In it, Brazile reveals how fissures of race, gender and age tore at the heart of the operation — even as Clinton was campaigning on a message of inclusiveness and trying to assemble a rainbow coalition under the banner of “Stronger Together.”

A veteran operative and television pundit who had long served as DNC’s vice chair, Brazile abruptly and, she writes, reluctantly took over in July 2016 for chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The Florida congresswoman was ousted from the DNC on the eve of the party convention after WikiLeaks released stolen emails among her and her advisers that showed favoritism for Clinton during the competitive primaries.

Brazile describes her mounting anxiety about Russia’s theft of emails and other data from DNC servers, the slow process of discovering the full extent of the cyberattacks and the personal fallout. She likens the feeling to having rats in your basement: “You take measures to get rid of them, but knowing they are there, or have been there, means you never feel truly at peace.”

Brazile writes that she was haunted by the still-unsolved murder of DNC data staffer Seth Rich and feared for her own life, shutting the blinds to her office window so snipers could not see her and installing surveillance cameras at her home. She wonders whether Russians had placed a listening device in plants in the DNC executive suite.

At first, Brazile writes of the hacking, top Democratic officials were “encouraging us not to talk about it.” But she says a wake-up moment came when she visited the White House in August 2016, for President Obama’s 55th birthday party. National security adviser Susan E. Rice and former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. separately pulled her aside to urge her to take the Russian hacking seriously, which she did, she writes.

That fall, Brazile says she tried to persuade her Republican counterparts to agree to a joint statement condemning Russian interference but that they ignored her messages and calls.

Backstage at a debate, she writes, she approached Sean Spicer, then-chief strategist for the Republican National Committee, but “I could see his eyes dart away like this was the last thing he wanted to talk to me about.” She asked RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, too, but “I got that special D.C. frost where the person smiles when he sees you but immediately looks past you trying to find someone in the room to come right over and interrupt the conversation.”

There would be no joint statement.

The WikiLeaks releases included an email in which Brazile, a paid CNN contributor at the time, shared potential topics and questions for a CNN town hall in advance with the Clinton campaign. She claims in her book that she did not recall sending the email and could not find it in her computer archives. Nevertheless, she eventually admitted publicly to sending it, believing her reputation would have suffered regardless.

At the Oct. 19 debate in Las Vegas, with the email scandal simmering, the Clinton campaign sat Brazile not in the front row — where she had been at the previous debate — but in bleachers out of view of cameras. She recalls watching the debate with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, “among others whom they had to invite but wanted to tuck away.”

Brazile describes in wrenching detail Clinton’s bout with pneumonia. On Sept. 9, she saw the nominee backstage at a Manhattan gala and she seemed “wobbly on her feet” and had a “rattled cough.” Brazile recommended Clinton see an acupuncturist.

Two days later, Clinton collapsed as she left a Sept. 11 memorial service at Ground Zero in New York. Brazile blasts the campaign’s initial efforts to shroud details of her health as “shameful.”

Whenever Brazile got frustrated with Clinton’s aides, she writes, she would remind them that the DNC charter empowered her to initiate the replacement of the nominee. If a nominee became disabled, she explains, the party chair would oversee a complicated process of filling the vacancy that would include a meeting of the full DNC.

After Clinton’s fainting spell, some Democratic insiders were abuzz with talk of replacing her — and Brazile says she was giving it considerable thought.

The morning of Sept. 12, Brazile got a call from Biden’s chief of staff saying the vice president wanted to speak with her. She recalls thinking, “Gee, I wonder what he wanted to talk to me about?” Jeff Weaver, campaign manager for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), called, too, to set up a call with his boss, and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley sent her an email.

Brazile also was paid a surprise visit in her DNC office by Baker, who, she writes, was dispatched by the Clinton campaign “to make sure that Donna didn’t do anything crazy.”

“Again and again I thought about Joe Biden,” Brazile writes. But, she adds, “No matter my doubts and my fears about the election and Hillary as a candidate, I could not make good on that threat to replace her.”

Neither Baker nor any other senior campaign official were aware that Brazile had any thoughts about or actively contemplated changing the ticket, a senior Clinton campaign official said Saturday.

“Charlie may well have been there to talk her out of doing something crazy, but it certainly was not about this,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Brazile writes that she inherited a national party in disarray, in part because President Obama, Clinton and Wasserman Schultz were “three titanic egos” who had “stripped the party to a shell for their own purposes.”

Brazile writes that she inherited Wasserman Schultz’s office — with “tropical pink” walls that she found hard on the eyes — and “ridiculous” perks, such as a Chevrolet Tahoe with driver and a personal entourage that included an assistant known as a body woman.

In her first few days on the job, Brazile writes that she also discovered the DNC was $2 million in debt and that the payroll was stacked with “hangers-on and sycophants.” For instance, Wasserman Schultz kept two consulting firms — SKDKnickerbocker and Precision Strategies — each on $25,000-a-month retainers, and one of Obama’s pollsters was still being paid $180,000 a year.

“The outgoing president no longer needed to assess his approval ratings or his policy decisions, at least not when the Democratic Party was fighting for its survival against a hostile foreign power,” she writes.

Jen O'Malley-Dillon, a partner at Precision Strategies, defended her firm's work for the DNC. “We worked hard to get the party's technology, infrastructure and ground operations in shape for the general election, regardless of the nominee,” she wrote Saturday in an email. “There was no gravy train and we are proud of our work.”

Brazile also details how Clinton effectively took control of the DNC in August 2015, before the primaries began, with a joint fundraising agreement between the party and the Clinton campaign.

She said the deal gave Clinton control over the DNC’s finances, strategy and staff decisions — disadvantaging other candidates, including Sanders. “This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party’s integrity,” she writes.

An excerpt of this chapter — titled “Bernie, I Found the Cancer” — was published Thursday in Politico, sparking discord and recriminations through the party.

As she traveled the country, Brazile writes, she detected an alarming lack of enthusiasm for Clinton. On black radio stations, few people defended the nominee. In Hispanic neighborhoods, the only Clinton signs she saw were at the campaign field offices.

But at headquarters in New York, the mood was one of “self-satisfaction and inevitability,” and Brazile’s early reports of trouble were dismissed with “a condescending tone.”

Brazile describes the 10th floor of Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters, where senior staff worked: “Calm and antiseptic, like a hospital. It had that techno-hush, as if someone had died. I felt like I should whisper. Everybody’s fingers were on their keyboards, and no one was looking at anyone else. You half-expected to see someone in a lab coat walk by.”

During one visit, she writes, she thought of a question former Democratic congressman Tony Coelho used to ask her about campaigns: “Are the kids having sex? Are they having fun? If not, let’s create something to get that going, or otherwise we’re not going to win.”

“I didn’t sense much fun or [having sex] in Brooklyn,” she deadpans.

Brazile writes that Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook and his lieutenants were so obsessed with voter data and predictive analytics that they “missed the big picture.”

“They knew how to size up voters not by meeting them and finding out what they cared about, what moved their hearts and stirred their souls, but by analyzing their habits,” she writes. “You might be able to persuade a handful of Real Simple magazine readers who drink gin and tonics to change their vote to Hillary, but you had not necessarily made them enthusiastic enough to want to get up off the couch and go to the polls.”

Brazile describes Mook, in his mid-30s, as overseeing a patriarchy. “They were all men in his inner circle,” she writes, adding: “He had this habit of nodding when you are talking, leaving you with the impression that he has listened to you, but then never seeming to follow up on what you thought you had agreed on.”

Many of Clinton’s senior staff were women, including Mook’s chief of staff, as well as campaign co-chair Huma Abedin.

Brazile’s criticisms were not reserved for Mook. After Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri challenged Brazile’s plan for Kaine to deliver a pep talk to DNC staff at the party convention in Philadelphia, Brazile writes, “I was thinking, If that b---- ever does anything like that to me again, I’m gonna walk.”

Palmieri on Saturday disputed Brazile's account, tweeting: “Sad to learn she feels this way about me. Don't recall request she refers to.”

Brazile writes with particular disdain about Brandon Davis, a Mook protege who worked as a liaison between the DNC and the Clinton campaign. She describes him as a spy, saying he treated her like “a crazy, senile old auntie and couldn’t wait to tell all his friends the nutty things she said.”

In staff meetings, Brazile recalls, “Brandon often rolled his eyes as if I was the stupidest woman he’d ever had to endure on his climb to the top. He openly scoffed at me, snorting sometimes when I made an observation.”

Brazile opens her book by describing the painful days following Clinton’s defeat. She received calls of gratitude from party leaders but still felt slighted.

“I never heard from Hillary,” she writes. “I knew what I wanted to say to her and it was: I have nothing but respect for you being so brave and classy considering everything that went on. But in the weeks after the loss, every time I checked my phone thinking I might have missed her call, it wasn’t her.”

Finally, in February 2017, Clinton rang.

“This was chitchat, like I was talking to someone I didn’t know,” Brazile writes. “I know Hillary. I know she was being as sincere as possible, but I wanted something more from her.”"

The GOAT. The greatest of all time.

The first was Fedor Emelianenko. Then it was Anderson Silva, but Chris Weidman sent him tumbling from the top.

It was Jon Jones and would have likely stayed that way for a long time, except for his inability avoid screwing things up.

And now we've pretty much settled on Demetrious Johnson, though doubters still exist due to the strength of the 5'3"" fighter's competition (and because of that weird thing where males look down upon other males who are small in stature).

Those names are the four most often mentioned. You know who you never hear about? Georges St-Pierre. Not anymore, at least. St-Pierre used to be ""in the mix"" back in the day, before he decided to go on hiatus and UFC President Dana White started burying him as a guy who ""didn't want to fight"" every chance he got.

Before UFC 217, St-Pierre was decreasingly mentioned as the greatest welterweight in history, which is somewhat mind-boggling and most certainly insulting.

And now, after he defeated Michael Bisping at UFC 217 by third-round submission Saturday night at Madison Square Garden, St-Pierre isn't just the new middleweight champion. He's back in the mix. He's a contender for greatest of all time. A possible GOAT. And he's the fourth fighter in UFC history to capture a championship in two weight classes.

St-Pierre returned after a four-year layoff to fight in the UFC 217 main event. He moved up a weight class, appearing mostly like a more muscular version of the guy we remember from back in the day. He was slower, of course, which is a thing that happens when you're carrying around more muscle and when you're four years older.

And maybe he looked a little rusty, too, in the beginning of the fight. It was kind of like he needed a little WD-40 to get the creaks out. The lubricant came in the form of a knockdown when St-Pierre closed out the first round by putting Bisping on the canvas with a combo that started with his patented Superman jab, the same jab we watched him use to great effect in capturing and carrying the welterweight title.

The second round went more in Bisping's favor, as the champion darted and weaved, and tagged St-Pierre with great strikes. Bisping even got up from under a visibly tiring St-Pierre after a takedown, which is a thing that never used to happen to St-Pierre.

It made you feel like maybe St-Pierre was running out of gas, or maybe he'd run out of time altogether. His corner forgot to give him back his mouthpiece before the third round, which would normally qualify as the weirdest thing to happen in that one-minute space except for the fact Bisping's cup had somehow broken and so his corner was forced to MacGyver his underwear into holding the cup in place.

The third round started, and Bisping looked good—just kept on right where he left off—then suddenly he was on his back again and fighting to stay conscious as St-Pierre tried to make him unconscious.

Frank Franklin II/Associated Press

And Bisping, ever the tough guy, lasted through the ground-and-pound, but he wasn't able to react when St-Pierre quickly moved to his back and sunk in one of those rear-naked chokes that makes your throat hurt even though you're watching at home. Bisping, because he is who he is, refused to tap out and opted to have his own lights turned out, his eyes slowly closing as he watched the final glimmer of light and his improbable championship reign slip away.

Georges St-Pierre. Middleweight champion.

St-Pierre joined Randy Couture, BJ Penn and Conor McGregor as a multi-division champion. He has more in common with Couture than the others, of course; Couture returned from a layoff after losing his UFC light heavyweight title to Chuck Liddell in 2006 by moving up to heavyweight and spanking Tim Sylvia around the Octagon to capture the heavyweight title. But Couture's layoff was only a little over a year long, not four years, and Couture's overall legacy is mixed at best.

St-Pierre's legacy? It's not mixed. He's the greatest welterweight in history. He hasn't lost a fight in 10 years. He's only lost twice in 15 years. And if those things weren't enough to give him a claim to being the greatest, he's now done what many consider to be the ultimate sign of a true all-time great: gone up in weight, faced a bigger man, put him down and taken his title.

Maybe he's not the greatest in your eyes. Maybe you think Johnson or Jones or Silva or Emelianenko have the edge. That's fine. The thing about the GOAT debate is that it'll never go away. We'll never have a consensus.

But here's one thing for certain: If you overlook St-Pierre at this point, maybe you're watching the wrong sport."
Rich Schapiro,Richard Dreyfuss’s son came forward to detail a shocking account of Kevin Spacey groping him while his unsuspecting father sat nearby.,2017-11-04T22:47:54Z,google-news,Richard Dreyfuss’ son: Kevin Spacey groped me at 18 with dad near,http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/richard-dreyfuss-son-kevin-spacey-groped-18-dad-article-1.3611105,http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611912.1509851547!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/article-spacey-3-1104.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Richard Dreyfuss’s son came forward Saturday to detail a shocking account of Kevin Spacey groping him while his unsuspecting father sat nearby.

Harry Dreyfuss, in penning his story in Buzzfeed News, became the latest of more than 10 men to accuse Spacey of sexual assault.

The younger Dreyfuss said he was just 18 when he accompanied his father to Spacey’s London apartment in 2008 to rehearse lines for the play “Complicit.”

The trio had been reading the script for some time when Spacey put his hand on Harry’s thigh.

“I thought, surely he can’t be coming on to me like this right in front of my dad,” Harry wrote. “But his hand stayed there.”

Harry twice moved away from Spacey, but the lecherous actor followed him each time, according to the Buzzfeed piece.

“Once again Kevin followed me, sat down, and with considerable effort, slid his hand between my right hand and my right leg,” Harry wrote.

“Over the course of about 20 seconds, centimeter by centimeter, Kevin crawled his hand from my thigh over toward my crotch. My mind went blank. Suddenly, he had completed his journey...”

“I stopped reading the script and my eyes went wide. I lifted up my head and faced him. Looking into his eyes, I gave the most meager shake of my head that I could manage.”

The elder Dreyfuss was too engrossed in the script to notice. Several years passed before Harry finally told his father about the abuse.

“Kevin Spacey is a sexual predator,” Harry wrote. “But I still never thought talking about it seriously was ever an option.”

Richard Dreyfuss, in a Saturday tweet, lauded his son for telling the painful story.

Anthony Rapp claims Kevin Spacey tried to seduce him at 14

“I love my son @harrydreyfuss more than I could explain with all the words in the world,” Richard Dreyfuss wrote.

“And I am so incredibly proud of him right now.""

Amid the cascading tales of abuse, Netflix announced Friday it was severing ties with Spacey and shutting down production of “House of Cards.”

Harry Dreyfuss’ account emerged hours after three more men stepped forward to describe sexual assault at the hands of Spacey.

Kevin Spacey getting treatment after sexual assault allegations

The men who came forward met Spacey several years ago. One was a minor at the time of the inappropriate contact, and another was a journalist who alleges Spacey screamed at him for not “wanting to f--k him,” according to a story published by BuzzFeed News on Friday.

The journalist, who wanted to remain anonymous to protect his career, told BuzzFeed News he interviewed Spacey for a story in the early 2000s in his office at the Old Vic and later found himself being yelled in the middle of a bar at by the actor for not wanting to have sex with him.

“He was charming and doing impressions of Jack Lemmon and so on,"" he said of the in-office encounter.

But after taking Spacey up on an offer to go out for some drinks, the actor started aggressively grabbing his genitals.

“He just kept reaching between my legs and, you know, just grabbing my d--k,” he told BuzzFeed News. “I would move his hand away, and say something that I thought was pretending was funny or whatever at first. And then I was starting to get annoyed by it, and that was pretty clear.”

The journalist even attempted to leave, but Spacey kept trying to make him stay.

“I ended up sitting back down. He kept rubbing my leg. I moved seats. He came over and sat next to me again. I was trying not to make a big scene, because I had an assignment to write about him,” the man stated.

The man also shared that no one with Spacey appeared to react to his behavior — and instead chose to turn a blind eye.

“(Spacey) came out after me and literally stood between me and the door,"" he said. ""This man (Spacey) was screaming in my face outside of the main bar area, red-faced, spit flying out of his mouth, screaming at me with fury because I didn't want to f--k him. He was actually saying that I did want to and I was a coward. That was his tactic. It was unbelievable.”

The journalist recounted the story to his editor, who confirmed hearing it to BuzzFeed.

Both the journalist and editor, working at an unidentified national magazine, were ready to move forward with the story when the reporter had a realization: the story would out Spacey as gay.

“It has occurred to me since then that there's this weird way that Spacey had discovered that the closet would shield other things,” the journalist said. “Being closeted has for him enabled him to use this privacy claim as a shield against anybody looking closely at his actual behavior. And then it may have served as this strange, protective mechanism, to say, 'My whole sexual life is off limits because of my sexuality.'”

Justin Dawes, who was 16 in 1988, met Spacey at the play “National Anthems” and was invited to his apartment to watch Roman Polanski’s “Chinatown.”

Instead when they arrived they were offered drinks while porn was playing on the TV.

“We all had a drink, and we were kind of like, ‘Oh, no one else is coming?’ And he’s like, ‘Oh, no one else decided to come,’ and he never mentioned that this porn was playing. It was really awkward,” Dawes told BuzzFeed News.

Dawes shared that Spacey, who was 29 at the time, was well-aware he was in high school. He called the experience “cringey” but “benign.”

He also added that though Spacey was “sleazy and manipulative” it was not as if the star was pushy.

Dawes, who is straight, admitted he may have given Spacey the wrong impression.

“I think I had this weird kinda like, Oh gee. Oh man, I feel bad.”

Dawes and his friend decided to leave and never interacted with Spacey after that day.

He also told BuzzFeed maybe he “should’ve realized” Spacey wanted him over for sex.

“Like maybe this was kind of a coded thing or something that I agreed to.”

A third man named Mark Ebenhoch said outing Spacey also held him back from telling his story.

Ebenhoch was a 35-year-old military adviser working on Spacey’s film, “Outbreak” — which also starred Dustin Hoffman — when an assistant of Spacey’s invited him to the actor’s trailer “to flat out engage in a sexual act.”

“It was enough to stun me. It blew me away,” he said.

Ebenhoch, who is now openly gay, was not at the time. He said he turned down the proposition and never went anywhere near Spacey on set after that.

“As a military adviser the last thing you’d want anyone to know is that you were gay,” he said.

A friend of Ebenhoch, Roy Locke, confirmed he had told him the story at the time.

Dawes, Ebenhoch and the anonymous journalist are just three of several men who have come forward accusing Spacey of similar behavior.

Actor Anthony Rapp first publicly accused Spacey of trying to seduce him when he was just 14 in an interview with BuzzFeed News.

Eight Netflix employees recently accused Spacey of targeting young male staffers on set with “predatory” behavior, CNN reported.

One account alleged Spacey put his hands down a staffer's pants.

Since the allegations have come to light, Spacey admitted he has chosen to live his life as a gay man and is now seeking evaluation and treatment."
JoAnna Klein,"Scientists may have had more luck tracking down how some fungi glow than you may have hunting bioluminescent mushrooms, a reporter discovered.",2017-05-02T13:34:28Z,hacker-news,"Hunting Mushrooms, and What Makes Some Glow in the Dark",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/science/glow-in-the-dark-mushrooms-bioluminescence.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/28/science/27TRI-MUSHROOM1/27TRI-MUSHROOM1-facebookJumbo.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"PISGAH NATIONAL FOREST, N.C. — Here’s what I was told: Get away from the city, go during a new moon and keep my flashlight off. When the sky faded black enough to spot stars twinkling, I’d be able to see mushrooms glowing.

There are about 100,000 species of fungi, but only about 80 of them bioluminesce, or glow in the dark. They pop up in tropical and temperate forests in the Americas, Japan, Southeast Asia, Australia and South Africa.

They emit green light, a result of nearly the same chemical reaction that illuminates the belly of a firefly or the skin of a squid, only the resulting light is constant in the mushroom, not on-demand or reactive as in some insects or marine animals. The molecules responsible for the colors are different too. And in a study published on Wednesday in Science Advances, researchers have finally revealed what’s going on inside these flamboyant fungi — at a molecular scale.

With mushroom season approaching, you can see them glowing, too, and you don’t even need to leave the country. But you’ll need to practice patience and prepare for disappointment when heading out on the hunt. In a boggy forest near Asheville, N.C., I once spent a night two summers ago tracking down three species of glowing mushrooms. Lost in the dark with a dying phone and a forager known locally as the Mushroom Man, I learned that mushrooms are unpredictable."
Wyatt Mason,The classicist Emily Wilson has given Homer’s epic a radically contemporary voice.,2017-11-03T20:36:27Z,hacker-news,The First Woman to Translate the ‘Odyssey’ Into English,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/05/magazine/05wilson1/05wilson1-facebookJumbo.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"When I first read these lines early this summer in The Paris Review, which published an excerpt, I was floored. I’d never read an “Odyssey” that sounded like this. It had such directness, the lines feeling not as if they were being fed into iambic pentameter because of some strategic decision but because the meter was a natural mode for its speaker. The subtle sewing through of the fittingly wavelike W-words in the first half (“wandered ... wrecked ... where ... worked”) and the stormy S-words that knit together the second half, marrying the waves to the storm in which this man will suffer, made the terse injunctions to the muse that frame this prologue to the poem (“Tell me about ...” and “Find the beginning”) seem as if they might actually answer the puzzle posed by Homer’s polytropos and Odysseus’s complicated nature.

Complicated: the brilliance of Wilson’s choice is, in part, its seeming straightforwardness. But no less than that of polytropos, the etymology of “complicated” is revealing. From the Latin verb complicare, it means “to fold together.” No, we don’t think of that root when we call someone complicated, but it’s what we mean: that they’re compound, several things folded into one, difficult to unravel, pull apart, understand.

“It feels,” I told Wilson, “with your choice of ‘complicated,’ that you planted a flag.”

“It is a flag,” she said.

“It says, ‘Guess what?’ — ”

“ ‘ — this is different.’ ”

Although translation might seem a natural step for a scholar preoccupied by the connections between antiquity and later texts, Wilson was dissuaded from pursuing it. “My colleagues told me: ‘You really shouldn’t be doing that kind of thing before tenure. Before tenure you have to write, you know, the right kind of book’ ” — the right kind being one on a subject that your discipline has yet to exhaust. Wilson did write a range of books before tenure, most on canonical texts: her study of suffering and death in literature; a monograph on Socrates. But, not heeding her colleagues’ advice, she began to translate Greek and Roman tragedies. A selection of Seneca’s plays appeared in 2010; four plays by Euripides in 2016. Both projects were outgrowths of her old desire to “spend a little bit longer” with these authors.

I asked Wilson why translation isn’t valued in the academy.

“Because there is no perception that it’s serious intellectually. It’s imagined as a subset of outreach. That you’re going to be communicating with the masses, which is less important than being innovative within your field. And even though I think translation is a way of being innovative within your field, my colleagues don’t see it that way.”

One way of talking about Wilson’s translation of the “Odyssey” is to say that it makes a sustained campaign against that species of scholarly shortsightedness: finding equivalents in English that allow the terms she is choosing to do the same work as the original words, even if the English words are not, according to a Greek lexicon, “correct.”

“What gets us to ‘complicated,’ ” Wilson said, returning to her translation of polytropos, “is both that I think it has some hint of the original ambivalence and ambiguity, such that it’s both ‘Why is he complicated?’ ‘What experiences have formed him?’ which is a very modern kind of question — and hints at ‘There might be a problem with him.’ I wanted to make it a markedly modern term in a way that ‘much turning’ obviously doesn’t feel modern or like English. I wanted it to feel like an idiomatic thing that you might say about somebody: that he is complicated.”

I asked: “What about the commentator who says, ‘It does something that more than modernizes — it subverts the fundamental strangeness of the way Odysseus is characterized.’ I’m sure some classicists are going to say it’s flat out wrong, ‘Interesting, but wrong.’ ”

“You’re quite right,” she replied. “Reviewers will say that.”

How, I asked, would she address such a complaint from someone in her field?

“I struggle with this all the time,” Wilson said. “I struggled with this because there are those classicists. I partly just want to shake them and make them see that all translations are interpretations.” Most of the criticism Wilson expects, she says, will come from “a digging in of the heels: ‘That’s not what it says in the dictionary, and therefore it can’t be right!’ And if you put down anything other than what’s said in the dictionary, then, of course, you have to add a footnote explaining why, which means that pretty much every line has to have a footnote. ...” Wilson paused. “That goes to what this translation is aiming to do in terms of an immersive reading experience and conveying a whole narrative. I don’t know what to say to those people, honestly.” Wilson laughed her buoyant laugh. “I need to have a better answer to them, because they will certainly review it, and they will certainly have a loud voice. They just seem to be coming from such a simple and fundamental misunderstanding.”

“Of what?”

“Of what any translation is doing.”

What a translation is doing — and what it should do — has been a source of vigorous debate since there were texts to translate. “I’m not a believer,” Wilson told me, “but I find that there is a sort of religious practice that goes along with translation. I’m trying to serve something.”

Early arguments about translation were over the Old Testament. One tale has it that an Egyptian king of the third-century B.C. wanted a Greek copy of the Pentateuch — the five books of Moses — for the Library of Alexandria. Some 70 Jewish elders said to be “skilled in the Scriptures and in both languages” were sent from Jerusalem. Each worked in a separate room to translate in isolation. When finished, they compared their work. The 70 translations? Identical, “in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end,” according to one account. The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word. Called “Septuagint” after its 70 translators, this Greek version became a foundational text, both for the early Christian church and for the impossible standard to which all subsequent translations are held: faithfulness. Later Bible translators failed to meet that mystical standard. The Catholic Church took 1,200 years to accept Jerome’s Latin version (“tainted with Judaism,” was the charge, as it relied on Hebrew sources). The first English Bible’s translator, John Wycliffe, was disinterred and his bones were burned for the heresy of translating into English, and his successor, William York Tyndale, was excommunicated, sentenced to death by strangulation and burned at the stake.

Although you can understand, if not condone, how murderous rage at a translator might arise if a believer supposed a sacred text to have been desecrated by a translator’s hand, it is somewhat surprising that similar vehemence can greet translations of secular canonical texts. Perhaps the most famous such expression is in Matthew Arnold’s “On Translating Homer,” his series of lectures in 1860 when he was Oxford professor of poetry. In them, he offered a takedown of existing translations of Homer and then asked “in what faithfulness exists”: “The translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities ... that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, that he is eminently noble.”

Most every Homeric translation since has been scrutinized against his quartet of qualities. Wilson is not persuaded.

“These are not good criteria,” Wilson told me. “I think he was a terrible reader of poetry. It’s not like he ever translated Homer. I think he had a good ‘classics major’ undergraduate kind of Greek, but I think it’s all to do with a particular notion of aesthetics and class, the whole ‘plainness and nobility.’ It’s about noblesse oblige and you’re going to be the kind of gentleman who’s going to have gone to Rugby and that will be the kind of language that we speak: the classy kind of language. And projecting all of that back on to the classics. This is what ‘sweetness and light’ is. It’s describing a boys’ club. I think it’s very interesting that’s still with us. Those are the four? It’s just the boys’ club.”

“I do think that gender matters,” Wilson said later, “and I’m not going to not say it’s something I’m grappling with. I’m trying to take this task and this process of responding to this text and creating this text extremely seriously, with whatever I have, linguistically, sonically, emotionally.”

At the center of each of Homer’s epics is a warrior. In the “Iliad,” it is Achilles, the greatest of the Greeks, a demigod almost invulnerable to death. Although the war is begun over a woman, Helen, stolen from her Greek husband by a Trojan, the “Iliad” is a poem about and presided over by men. Zeus is the poem’s prevailing god, and what men do, or are willing to do, in love and war and in the friendships that arise in war and its losses, are the poem’s preoccupations.

In the “Odyssey,” preoccupations shift, radically. Zeus is replaced by Athena as the dominant god of the tale; the poem begins not with Odysseus but with his wife, Penelope, who has been without him for 20 years, in a kingdom overrun by suitors for her hand, whom the conventions of hospitality ensure she cannot simply expel. The reader doesn’t even see Odysseus until the fifth of the poem’s 24 books, where we learn that he has been living on an island with Calypso, a goddess, for seven years; that, earlier, he was detained by another goddess, Circe, with whom he also shared a bed; that the Sirens, as he navigates, call to him, desiring him; that a young princess falls in love with him; that, on all sides, women are temptresses, and whereas he submits, we are to understand that Penelope, alone, assailed, remains faithful.

“In the second-wave feminist scholarship in classics,” Wilson told me, “people were very keen to try to read Penelope as, ‘Let’s find Penelope’s voice in the “Odyssey,” and let’s celebrate her, because look, here she is being the hero in an epic in ways we can somehow unpack.’ I find that’s a little simplistic. What happens to all the unelite women?”

In the episode that Wilson calls “one of the most horrible and haunting of the whole poem,” Odysseus returns home to find that his palace has been overrun by suitors for his wife’s hand. Though she has resisted them, the women in her palace have not. Odysseus, after slaying the suitors, tells his son, Telemachus, to kill the women. It is an interesting injunction from Odysseus, who himself, during his 10 years of wandering, was serially unfaithful. In Robert Fagles’s much-praised translation of the poem, Telemachus says, before he executes the palace women on his father’s command: “No clean death for the likes of them, by god!/Not from me — they showered abuse on my head, my mother’s too!/You sluts — the suitors’ whores!”

But Wilson, in her introduction, reminds us that these palace women — “maidservants” has often been put forward as a “correct” translation of the Greek δμωαι, dmoai, which Wilson calls “an entirely misleading and also not at all literal translation,” the root of the Greek meaning “to overpower, to tame, to subdue” — weren’t free. Rather, they were slaves, and if women, only barely. Young female slaves in a palace would have had little agency to resist the demands of powerful men. Where Fagles wrote “whores” and “the likes of them” — and Lattimore “the creatures” — the original Greek, Wilson explained, is just a feminine definite article meaning “female ones.” To call them “whores” and “creatures” reflects, for Wilson, “a misogynistic agenda”: their translators’ interpretation of how these females would be defined. Here is how Wilson renders their undoing:"

Live esports is an experience worth seeing for yourself. Live esports is an experience worth seeing for yourself.

Watching the USA play South Korea live at the Overwatch World Cup yesterday made me believe in Overwatch esports.

I think many people, myself included, are skeptical about the incredibly popular FPS’s competitive future. It’s been a hard game to spectate, to the point where Blizzard has openly admitted it and announced they are making changes to help Overwatch esports easier to follow.

Exit Theatre Mode

New camera angles, including an overhead “gameboard” style view, can help clarify what’s going on, but the truly game changing improvement is team jerseys. Each team now has custom colors that stick with them, changing the look of both heroes and every ability effect to make it clearer who is using what.

Sitting in a packed stadium full of people chanting “USA” and screaming over every kill convinced me that those changes are working. I’ve seen a lot of live esports, but this match was among the best - the energy was palpable in the room, and if you haven’t had the chance to see live esports before, I can’t recommend it enough.

What made this match so special was that nearly everyone had counted the USA out, and while they lost 3-1, it was nowhere near as close as that scoreline might imply.

Exit Theatre Mode

The USA came out strong by winning on Nepal, changing the entire tone of the series and giving fans a burst of new confidence. And while they lost the second map on Eichenwalde, it was incredibly close and pushed into overtime on both sides.

But the stand out map of the series was the third on Hanamura, which unbelievably ended in a draw. The two teams stood side-by-side as evenly matched adversaries, which is beyond what anyone expected by a wide margin. It often came down to overtime point caps, and sometimes even just a duel between two players.

The stand out rivalry of this tournament has to be South Korea’s Flow3r and USA’s Jake. Flow3r had some incredible killstreaks as Widowmaker, while Jake was frequently on fire as Junkrat. It was incredible to see these two rising stars go head-to-head over and over again, and the spectator crew did a great job of capturing their incredible plays.

Exit Theatre Mode

The series was so enjoyable for three main reasons: The energy of the live event, which is admittedly hard to replicate. The ability to root for a home team that wasn’t some generic esport organization, which the Overwatch League addresses wonderfully by linking teams to cities. And finally the tangible changes Blizzard made to the competitive spectator experience, which really make all the difference.

USA vs Korea changed my mind about Overwatch esports not just because it was an exciting match, but because it felt like an experience Blizzard is ready to try and replicate. I don’t know if they’ll be able to recreate that energy or similarly incredible storylines too, but I’m a lot more optimistic than I was before this tournament.

Traditionally gaming laptops have been three things: big, heavy, and expensive. That isn't always the case any longer, as components have gotten smaller and more portable, and increased competition has caused prices to fall quite a bit as well. You still generally get what you pay for in terms of performance and portability, but you can get a great portable 1080p machine these days for less than $1,000, which was rarely the case just one generation of hardware ago.

Before we dive into our list of the best cheap gaming laptops, let’s go over what to look for in a gaming laptop. After all, just because a device is affordable and has “Gaming” in its name doesn’t mean it’s going to get the job done for everyone. The main features to consider when shopping for a gaming laptop are its GPU, display resolution, amount and kind of storage, and even portability are things you should keep in mind when shopping for an inexpensive gaming laptop.

Too Long; Didn't Read

Below we've sketched out what GPU and other specs you need in a lower-end 1080p laptop that will run games at surprisingly decent frame rates for at least a couple years. Without breaking the bank, of course The bottom line? Dell's last-generation Inspiron 15 7000 will run most current-gen games on low-med settings at 40-60 FPS, all for $800. It's a great pick for a casual gaming + daily driving laptop. Read on for more!

When it comes to GPUs, NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 10-series have made it possible for manufacturers to trim down the overall size of laptops without sacrificing features like battery life, making them powerful and portable. AMD's also basically non-existent in the mobile space these days too, so if you're shopping for a gaming laptop you're probably getting one with an Nvidia GPU under the hood.

For screen resolution, a 1080p display hits the sweet spot between price and required GPU beefiness. It is typically the only option for a value-oriented gaming laptop. Even if you could score a laptop with a high-resolution 4k panel, chances are the GPU inside won't be able to run games at that resolution, so prepare yourself for 1080 gaming.

When it comes to storage, try to steer clear of laptops with a lone 128GB SSD. Heck, even a model with a 256GB SSD offers barely enough space to keep multiple games installed and at the ready, so you might be stuck getting a system with a slower, yet much more spacious, spinning hard drive.

You can also get a sweet deal by going back in time and looking at laptops with previous-gen CPUs, as they are usually available at fire sale prices and there's not a huge difference in performance between Skylake and Kaby Lake for gaming. You won't be quite as future-proof, but you'll still get several years of great 1080p gaming at a low price. Let's dive into the this:

Dell Inspiron 15 7000

Priced under $800, the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 boasts previous generation hardware, but don’t let that deter you. In January 2016, this model earned an Editor's Choice award for entry level gaming laptops from our sister pub PCMag.

Boasting a full HD 15.6-inch 1080p display, 256GB SSD, and an Nvidia GTX 960M GPU, the Inspiron 15 7000 is capable enough for a casual PC gamer that wants both a gaming machine and a laptop for school. Dell says it has a battery life of over 10 hours on this particular model, with all its hardware tucked into a flashy design that's just one inch thick. At close to 6-pounds you’ll notice when it’s in a bag or backpack. Beyond its older specs, the only drawback is its 256GB of storage, but again, if you're mostly looking for a daily driver and also want to do some casual gaming, this is a very good option.

Dell Inspiron 15 7000, Part Two

This year's model of the Inspiron 15 7000 is a little more expensive (although still sub-$1000) and a little more capable than last year’s, so it's also a good deal. The current model features a seventh-generation Core i7 processor, and an Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU, so it has a high-end CPU and a lower-end GPU. Additionally, it comes with 12GB of DDR4 memory, a 128GB SSD, and a 1TB HDD. Dell stuck with the same 15.6-inch full HD 1080p anti-glare LED-backlit display. The 1050 GPU inside will run most 2017 games at 40+ FPS at medium settings, which is a great bang for your buck.

It’s a rather unassuming piece of kit, with a black exterior and red highlights above the keyboard and around the touchpad — much like the Acer Predator, in fact. This particular model is the typical entry-level gaming PC, both in terms of pricing and specifications. In other words, you can’t really go wrong with this pick.

MSI GL72M

Sitting just under the psychologically painful four-figure price point, the MSI GL72M is nearly identical on the spec sheet to our last pick, the Dell Inspiron 15 7000. The biggest difference between the two is its 17.3-inch FHD non-reflective display, and that is has only 8GB of memory.

Still, it's packing some serious technology including a SteelSeries gaming keyboard with a bright red backlight, an Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, GTX 1050 GPU, 128GB SSD, and a 1TB HDD. It’s a tad heavier and thicker than most laptops in this class, weighing in at exactly 6-pounds and 1.2-inches thick.

If you’re looking to save a bit more money, you can move down to a 15.6-inch model, which happens to be our next pick.

MSI GL62M

The GL62M offers a 15.6-inch display and an Intel Core i5-7300HQ processor. At just under $800, the Gl62M should power through nearly anything you throw at it at medium detail levels without sacrificing much in terms of performance. Rounding out the performance specs is the GTX 1050, 8 GB DDR4 memory, and a 256 GB SSD.

And because it was a smaller display than its bigger brother, the weight has dropped down to 5.29-pounds. The thickness, however, is over the 1-inch mark (1.06, to be exact).

As far as ports are concerned, you get a USB Type-C, 2x USB 3.0 ports, a lowly USB 2.0 port, HDMI, LAN, and a Mini-Display Port. Not a bad loadout considering its price.

Acer Aspire VX 15

Acer’s Aspire VX 15 is part of the company's newer line of affordable gaming machines, designed for those who don't have the budget for a Predator model. It offers a respectable balance of performance and price thanks to its GTX 1050 Ti GPU, Intel Core i5-7300HQ processor, 16 GB DDR4 memory and a 256GB SSD sitting below the “Red Hot” backlit keyboard. Red accents surround the WASD keys for easy visibility.

What sets the Acer apart from the competition is its Dolby Audio Premium sound, which should sound crisp when you’re watching a video, jamming out to some tunes, or gaming. The Acer Aspire XV 15 is about as much computer you can squeeze out of a budget under $1,000.

Razer Blade Stealth 12.5-inch

Ultra-lightweight and ultra-portable, with a sharp and high-res display shouldn’t be something we are talking about when it comes to cheap gaming laptops, but here we are. The Razer Blade Stealth is a 12.5-inch ultrabook with a quad-HD (2560x1440) display, and ok… it’s not a true gaming laptop, as it doesn't have a discrete GPU but rather Intel HD Graphics 620, but it's enough for very light gaming. Plus, this thing just looks cool. And if you really wanted to use it as a more serious gaming setup, you can pick up a refurbished Razer Core for $399. All in, that’s around $1,300 according to my horrible math — it’s the best of both worlds!

At just 0.5-inches thin and weighing 2.8-pounds, Razer has created a device that’s better fit for classrooms or cubicles than a gaming setup. Yet, the Razer Blade Stealth has some features synonymous with the company’s name, such as a 16.8 million color Chroma keyboard. The only real drawback worth mentioning, aside from the aforementioned integrated graphics, is the fact that it comes with a lone 128 GB SSD.

To be very clear, unlike every other machine recommended here, the Razer Blade does not feature very respectable gaming performance. But we're including it for someone looking for a new day-to-day laptop that might also have some mild interest in catching up on older games.

ASUS FX502VM

We set a limit of $1,200 as the high end of what we consider a “cheap” gaming laptop, and the Asus FX502 just barely sneaks under that subjective limit — but, oh boy, is it loaded. Ot offers a 7th generation Core i7-7700HQ processor, GTX 1060 GPU, 16GB DDR4 memory, 128GB SSD, and 1TB HDD so it's at the higher end of ""cheap"" but you can see why.

Its 15.6-inch 1920x1080 full-HD display has a 160-degree viewing angle, which is a little less than some of its competitors, but nothing to scoff at. Compared to the rest of our picks, the FX502 and the Predator (more on it in a minute) are the only two devices to feature an i7 and a GTX 1060 in one package, so they're the best for 60fps 1080p gaming with details maxed.

If you have a little bit more budget, and you're a gamer, the FX502 is money well spent.

Acer Predator Helios 300

Acer’s Predator Helios 300 is a budget-oriented Predator model with great parts at an affordable price. It sports an Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, GTX 1060 GPU, 16GB DDR4 memory, and a 15.6-inch full HD (1920 x 1080) 16:9 display. A laundry list of ports, including HDMI, will ensure you have enough room to plug any accessories or peripherals into the Predator.

And with up to seven hours of claimed battery life, the Helios could actually double as a work machine, or at least make flights a bit less boring."

Watching Overwatch Esports Just Got a Lot Easier Watching Overwatch Esports Just Got a Lot Easier

As a huge Overwatch fan who didn’t really care about watching the game competitively, Blizzard’s esports spectator improvements are incredible.

Watch the video above to see what Blizzard has to say about the changes.

Instead of burying their heads in the sand and pretending Overwatch didn’t have spectator problems, Blizzard has proactively started fixing them. Team uniforms and colors are the most obvious and effective, but an improved AI camera and impressive instant replay functionality certainly help as well.

The difference is night and day, and I didn’t think something as simple as color-coded skins and abilities could make such a difference. But the increased clarity has had an immediate impact on how engaged I am in watching a match.

The Overwatch World Cup has been a fantastic proof of concept for these new features, especially the unbelievably exciting USA vs Korea quarter-final. I was pretty skeptical leading into BlizzCon, but now I’m more excited for the Overwatch League than ever.

Let us guide you through the world... of Warcraft. Let us guide you through the world... of Warcraft.

Today we’re taking a look at the brand new cinematic trailer for the World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth expansion.

First thing we see is the Undercity, previously the capital city of Lorderon in Warcraft 3 and previous games in the series. It fell to the undead during the events of Warcraft 3 after Arthas murdered his father, the king. It’s been under horde occupation ever since and acts as the main city for the Undead race.

Next we see a ton of Horde banners all along the walls, then at 0:32, we get our first shot of Sylvannis Windrunner. Ever since Vol’jin was killed in the opening mission for the Legion expansion, she’s been the warchief of the Horde.

At 0:41, we see Alliance footmen in some modified armor. Footmen have been very recognizable units in all of the previous Warcraft titles. They act as foot soldiers for the alliance, but also as guards in some of the major cities and towns. In this trailer their armor looks slightly modified and more rigid than the previous rounded out shoulder pads. The wall we see here is the same one Sylvaniss and all of the archers were standing on top of in the previous scene. It seems like the alliance is making a push to try and retake the capital city of what was once Lordaeron.

Exit Theatre Mode

At 0:44 we see the sword Shalamayne, previously owned by Varian Wrynn. Varian was the king of Stormwind until he was killed by Guldan in the opening mission of Legion. In this shot it’s being held by his son Anduin, now king of Stormwind and leader of the alliance.

This nice wolfman at 0:49 is Genn Greymane, a worgen and king of Gilneas. Gilneas was a kingdom under the rule of Lordaeron before it fell, so it makes sense that he’d be here helping try to take it back since there is an emotional stake in it. He’s also one of Anduin’s most trusted advisors.

We see Anduin in his brand new set of armor at 0:53, which is very lion themed.

At 1:07, we get more alliance footmen and some dwarven gunmen, which were prominent ranged units in Warcraft 3.

Now at 1:10, we see a Balista, a classic and recognizable Warcraft unit. It’s basically a catapult that launches giant arrows. In the back are some kind of siege machines that we’ve never really seen before in previous games or expansions.

Jumping ahead to 1:22, this is Varok Saurfang, leader of the orc in Orgimmar after the absence of Thrall. He’s a veteran of all three great wars and has been a chief military leader over the course of WoW’s history. His prominent presence in the trailer means that he’s most likely going to be a key character over the course of the story.

Exit Theatre Mode

At 1:24 some Night Elf Archers, and then at 1:48, we have Sylvannis killing some people with her banshee powers

At 2:02, Sylvannis again in her banshee form resurrecting her fallen allies and killing some soldiers.

There are some mages, dwarven gunmen to the right, and a draenei in the background at 2:31, followed by Anduin and Genn again getting ready to charge at 2:33. Seconds later, we see Anduin fighting, which is pretty cool considering his previous stances on violence.

Jumping ahead to 3:20, Anduin drops the sword and starts to use the light to resurrect his fallen allies. Before he was crowned king, he was a priest in training, strove for Peace, and opposed conflict. Seeing him fight in the trailer is kind of a big deal since it’s a turn around for his character.

His dropping of the sword here and using his powers to heal might be a clue as to his inner struggle between peace and violence over the course of the story in Battle for Azeroth. And after that, we get a whole lot more fight scenes

In a letter shared exclusively with The Independent, mental health bodies issued an unprecedented warning to ministers that if budgets are not increased and protected, the majority of mental health sufferers will remain “locked out” of vital services.

Almost a year on from Theresa May’s pledge to improve mental health support and ensure it has parity with physical health services, the letter accuses her of setting out “unambitious” targets, urging that services “cannot go on” with the current levels of funding.

The 12 signatories – which include the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP), the Mental Health Foundation and Young Minds – urge that the Autumn Budget at the end of November marks a “critical moment” for ministers to show that they are serious about mental health, by ring-fencing vital budgets.

Opposition politicians have backed the appeal, accusing the Government of “recklessly” allowing mental health budgets to be raided in order to plug holes in other underfunded areas of the NHS and urging that ring-fencing the mental health budget would help reverse this.

The Government has said repeatedly that it is investing £1bn extra in mental health services per year, but the charities and politicians urge that this falls short of what is needed and is often failing to reach the frontline.

“We cannot go on with such unambitious targets, or simply accept a situation where promises of extra funding don’t actually materialise at the frontline,” the letter states.

“If the Government is actually to deliver parity of esteem, the Chancellor needs to invest in and ring-fence the mental health budget to ensure any money promised genuinely reaches those it is intended to help. The crisis is here, the crisis is now.”

In a speech in January, the Prime Minister said that for too long, mental illness had been “a hidden injustice in our country”, and pledged to transform the way mental health problems are dealt with “right across society”.

But despite Ms May’s pledges, mental health services have faced mounting pressures over funding amid rising demand. Freedom of Information requests recently showed that over half of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) plan to reduce the proportion of their budget they spend on mental health for 2016-17.

Vulnerable people are meanwhile facing a “postcode lottery” over treatment, despite official NHS guidelines stating that all CCGs must increase their spending on mental health in line with their overall budget increase.

Highlighting the decline in child mental health services, a major review by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) last week revealed vulnerable children were facing “agonising waits” for treatment, often causing their mental health to deteriorate further.

The findings showed that even when children do access treatment, the services were not always adequate to respond to their needs, with more than a third (39 per cent) of specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) across the UK currently requiring improvement.

Professor Sarah Niblock, chief executive at the UKCP, which represents over 8,000 highly qualified psychotherapists, urged that the Budget was a “critical moment” for the Government to show that it is serious about mental health.

“For all the promises of extra funding in recent years, the truth is that much of the money promised isn’t reaching the front line – and instead is being siphoned off to fund other services,” she told The Independent.

“If the Government wants to make its promises a reality, it needs to ring-fence the mental health budget. Mental health charities want it, professional bodies want it, and 160 MPs have written to the Prime Minister calling for it. Now is the time for change.”

Sharon Hodgson MP, Labour’s shadow minister for public health, accused the Government of “recklessly” allowing mental health budgets to be raided in order to plug holes in other underfunded areas of the NHS.

“The result has been children waiting 18 months to be treated, young people with eating disorders turned away for not being thin enough and vulnerable adults sent miles from their homes just to get a mental health bed,” she told The Independent.

“If the Tory Government is serious about making mental health an equal priority to physical health it should listen to the mental health community and follow Labour’s lead by committing to greater mental health investment, and to ring-fence the mental health budget so that money reaches the front line.”

Liberal Democrat spokesperson Norman Lamb MP said there was a “powerful moral case” for ring-fenced mental health funding, urging that it would help bring an end to the “scandalous” practice of diverting mental health funds to plug gaps elsewhere.

“Despite all the talk of ‘parity of esteem’, we have seen repeated examples of money being shaved off mental health care and diverted to plug gaps in other services. This is a scandalous practice, with the result that too many people continue to be denied vital treatment and support,” he said.

“It is critically important that money promised for mental health is spent as intended, and the Government should carefully consider ring-fencing the mental health budget as a way of achieving this.”

Responding to the letter, a Department of Health spokesperson said: “We are investing more in mental health than ever before – with spending at a record £11.6bn this year.

“The benefits of record funding can already be seen in areas such as mental health support in A&E, 24/7 crisis services and perinatal, and this trend is set to continue thanks to investment of a further £1bn by 2020/21.”

Letter in full:

We, leading mental health bodies in the UK, are calling on the Government to take immediate action to address the rising levels of mental ill-health.

The Government must increase investment in mental health services and ring-fence the mental health budget, ahead of the Autumn Budget. The focus must also be on investing upstream to prevent mental health problems from developing and escalating into crisis.

Without this action, it will not be possible to absorb the spiralling costs of services associated with providing the best care and support.

The majority of children and adults with mental health issues are unable to get the help they need – nor will they get it any time soon.

With a government target for just 25 per cent of adults with mental health issues to access talking therapies by 2020, parity of esteem remains very unlikely.

For children the situation is not much better, the 2020 mental health access target of just 35 per cent still leaves the remaining 65 per cent locked out of services.

The Government has said repeatedly that it’s investing £1bn extra in mental health services per year, but that money falls short of what is needed, and often isn’t reaching the front line.

Freedom of Information requests have shown that over half of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) plan to reduce the proportion of their budget they spend on mental health for 2016-17.

We cannot go on with such unambitious targets, or simply accept a situation where promises of extra funding don’t actually materialise at the front line.

If the Government is actually to deliver parity of esteem, the Chancellor needs to invest in and ring-fence the mental health budget to ensure any money promised genuinely reaches those it is intended to help. The crisis is here, the crisis is now.

In a speech at the Labour Party’s north-west conference, the Labour leader will say: “Labour is committed not just to challenging a warped and degrading culture in Westminster, and across society, but to overturning it.

“Faced with the ongoing revelations about sexual harassment, we must make this a turning point and a moment of real change.

“We must say ‘no more’. We must no longer allow women, or anyone else for that matter, to be abused in the workplace or anywhere else.

“This is not about peering into some dark recesses. This kind of abuse, sexism and misogyny, has been hiding in plain sight. It is all around us. It is, sadly, in our schools and universities, it is in our businesses and workplaces, in our newspapers and on our TV screens, and yes, it is in the corridors of power.

“It is not enough to say ‘this is wrong’, then only tinker with procedures. How we respond to this moment will shape the way we live our lives. We need to make a fundamental shift in the balance of power and transform the way our society works.”

Mr Corbyn is under fire over his decision to promote his friend Kelvin Hopkins to the Shadow Cabinet, even after allegations he had rubbed his crotch against a young party activist at the University of Essex.

Former Labour Chief Whip Rosie Winterton said she raised concerns with Mr Corbyn following his decision to make Mr Hopkins the new Shadow Culture Secretary in June last year. Ms Winterton had reprimanded the Luton North MP – who backed Mr Corbyn’s leadership campaign – over allegations against him by party activist Ava Etemadzadeh in 2015.

Mr Hopkins has denied the allegations but has now been suspended from the party while it is investigated.

Mr Corbyn will also announce that a leading barrister has been appointed to investigate claims made by party activist Bex Bailey, that she was raped at a party event in 2011 and told speaking out about it would damage her career."

As he embarked on a 12-day tour of the Asia Pacific region, Mr Trump hit out at Jeff Sessions and said he was “disappointed” the former Alabama senator was not probing alleged “dishonesty” among his political rivals.

He told ABC that “I don’t know” what he would do if Mr Sessions did not pursue Hillary Clinton, who he continues to call “Crooked Hillary”.

“I’m not really involved with the Justice Department,” he said. “I’d like to let it run itself. But honestly, they should be looking at Democrats ... They should be looking at a lot of things, and a lot of people are disappointed with the Justice Department, including me.”

In later tweets, the President referenced recent claims about a back-room deal between Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), that gave the eventual presidential nominee some say in staff hiring and canvassing in return for $1.2m (£918,000).

Most controversially, the deal, revealed in an excerpt of a new book by former acting DNC chair Donna Brazile, was done before Ms Clinton won the party’s nomination as its candidate in the 2016 election.

Written into it was a clause that “nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC’s obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the nominating process”.

But, he really wanted to have had the largest crowd on record. So, he praised it as the biggest crowd ever.

Mr Trump tweeted: “The real story on Collusion is in Donna B’s new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!

“People are angry. At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!

“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems.”

Donald Trump says: ‘I’m the only one who matters’

Two White House officials quickly cautioned against reading too much into Mr Trump’s comments, reiterating that he has no plans to fire Mr Sessions.

And although the White House maintains that Mr Trump’s tweets are an “official record”, it says Trump has not ordered Sessions or the FBI to do anything related to Democrats.

Republican senator Bob Corker, who has been an outspoken critic of the President, said that “like me, most Americans hope that our justice system is independent and free of political interference”.

He added: “President Trump’s pressuring of the Justice Department and FBI to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate and not only undermine our justice system but erode the American people’s confidence in our institutions.”

White House aides said the tweets were a way to deflect attention from the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

This week, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates, who also had a role in the campaign, were indicted on 12 counts, and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about his dealings with Russians who were offering “dirt” on Ms Clinton.

He adds: “But I hope you'll remember that the long sweep of America is defined by forward motion, and the course we chart from here depends on no one person alone.”

Mr Obama sends the letter to those who share concerns about the state of the country, or those who seek his perspective on the new administration, a spokesperson told Yahoo News, which first obtained the letter.

The former president accepts correspondence via his website and by regular post addressed to his office.

Mr Obama has largely stayed out of politics since leaving the White House.

But he did speak out in a bid to protect some of his key policies, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation.

He also spoke out when Donald Trump attempted to repeal the the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare, which provided health insurance to large swathes of the US population who did not have it.

Michelle Obama launches veiled attack on Trump: ""You don’t tweet every thought""

Mr Obama also recently took a swipe at Mr Trump's notorious ""birther"" theory, joking that he was ""born in Kenya"". He was, in fact, born in Hawaii.

But Mr Obama’s criticisms have been more muted than those of other former presidents – namely, George HW Bush and his son, George W Bush.

Mr Bush Sr once called the current President “a blowhard,” and Mr Bush Jr claimed he “doesn’t know what it means to be president,” according to the forthcoming book The Last Republicans.

Some former Obama administration staffers, however, told Yahoo that they are happy Mr Obama has stayed out of the fray.

“[Mr Trump] is desperate for an opponent,” one former staffer said. “I mean, Trump would love nothing more than for the 2020 election to start today and no better opponent than the black, ‘Muslim,’ Obamacare president.”

What Mr Obama would like to do instead, he says, is encourage young people to get active in politics. In his first public event since leaving the White House, he said that inspiring young people was “the most important thing I can do for my next job”.

He echoes this sentiment in his letter, in which he urges concerned citizens to become more involved.

“Our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted, and change only happens when people get involved,” he writes. “As long as folks like you keep looking out for others and working to defend America’s promise, I'm confident our future will be bright.”"

Chaotically, the firing squad executed Tsar Nicholas II, his 13-year-old son Alexei, daughters Maria, Anastasia, Olga and Tatiana, wife Alexandra and their attendants in the cellar of a merchant house in Yekaterinburg, western Siberia.

Then they set about destroying the evidence.

The bodies were removed – first by truck, and then by horse and cart, to a deep pit called Ganina Yama 25km away. There, the Bolsheviks tipped the bodies in, and began to dissolve the bodies in acid.

The Ganina Yama pit has today been converted into a monastery complex. It is a religious Disneyland, with shrines, shops and cafes, and a multitude of icons in honour of the tsar. Inside, excited guides talk of the tsar’s “ultimate, redemptive sacrifice”, and point to the now sanctified pit, where, elderly, sickly-looking women are muttering prayers.

“Forgive us, saintly passion-bearer, Tsar-Martyr Nicholas,” they say.

The pilgrims are certain they have arrived at the final resting spot of their hero. Except they haven’t. It turns out, the Bolsheviks hadn’t brought enough acid to destroy the bodies completely. So when local villagers began to ask awkward questions, the soldiers retrieved the bodies and desperately looked for another place to bury their crime.

The Bolsheviks eventually decided on a field called Porosenkov Log in the Koptyaki forest, approximately 4km away.

With the Communist Party unkeen to advertise the nature of the family’s death, the bodies would remain at Porosenkov Log, untouched for the next sixty years. In 1978, an Interior Ministry filmmaker called Geli Ryabov began a new search. No one knows why he started; perhaps he’d been tipped off about the diamond-studded corset the Tsarina had been wearing. Or why, when a year later he sought an urgent audience with Leonid Brezhnev in Moscow to show the bones and bullet ridden-skulls, he was turned down.

Regardless, the bodies were reburied in Yekaterinburg, and it would only be when the Soviet Union fell that the full story was made public. Even then, the remains of only nine bodies were recovered. The other two bodies, children Maria and Alexei, were found sixteen years later, in 2007, in a separate grave about 20 metres away. Today, simple crosses mark the burial sites in Porosenkov Log, in stark contrast to the glitz at Ganina Yama. When The Independent visited the memorial, the only person in sight was a man walking his dog.

Every year, on the anniversary of the killings, a nocturnal pilgrimage from Yekaterinburg passes 50 or so metres past the memorial. This year, as with every previous year, none of the pilgrims turned in, and instead carried onwards, towards Ganina Yama.

Nikolai Neuimin was part of the 2007 research group that put the final pieces of the burial mystery together. The imposing, bearded academic today heads the Romanov history department in the local Sverdlovsk Regional History Museum.

His modest exhibition shows the surviving artefacts: the original testimonies, the pistols, and the iron bars of the cellar window, recovered from the now-destroyed merchant house. One of the exhibits is the very first report into the killing, the 1919 commission by the monarchist investigator Nikolai Sokolov. Mr Sokolov’s claims to have recovered the remains in Ganina Yama have since been contradicted by four separate genetic analyses.

Mr Neuimin calls the Sokolov report “the writings of a madman”. The only real evidence the investigator offered, he says, were bones, and these were later proven not to be of human origin.

Incredibly, the report remains the basis for the official position of the Orthodox Church, which refuses to accept the bodies are anywhere but Ganina Yama.

In 1998, the remains of the first nine bodies were reburied in a grand ceremony in St Petersburg. The Orthodox leadership stayed away from the funeral, but two years later, the church canonised Nicholas II and his family.

When the remains of the final two bodies were found in 2007, Orthodox authorities refused to accept them: they were saints, after all. In the confusion, the Russian State Archives stepped forward, and, by quirk of fate, the remains of Alexei and Maria, the Tsar’s now saintly children, ended up in the same drawer as the skull and gold-toothed jawbone of Adolf Hitler.

The Church’s inflexible position has given rise to a culture of ignorance and hysteria around the Romanovs, says the historian. And at its extremes is a movement that has come to be known as tsarebozhniki or Russia’s “tsar worshippers”, who go one step further to sanctify everything the tsar did.

The tsar-worshipper ideology is simple as it is attractive: the supposedly peace-loving Nicholas II sacrificed himself and his family to atone for the sins of the entire Russian nation. But it is the “Wahhabism of the Orthodox faith”, says Mr Neuimin – a fantasy that has given birth to any number of other historical untruths.

Appearing at the end of the 1990s, Russia’s tsar worshippers were initially a cranky group that few paid attention to. But earlier this year, the radical edge of the movement showed its teeth. The trigger was a new film, depicting – at times, erotically – the true story of a love affair between Nicholas and a young ballerina, Matilda Kshesinskaya. The director of the “blasphemous” film, Alexei Uchitel, was targeted in two separate arson attacks.

Yekaterinburg saw its fair share of Matilda protests, and one especially violent turn. In early September, a 39-year-old man rammed a truck loaded with gas canisters into the city’s Cosmos cinema, which had been scheduled to screen the film. The attack didn’t quite work out as planned, however, and the suspect was forced to present himself at hospital with serious burns.

Here, he admitted to investigators that he had spent the previous day receiving divine instruction in the Temple on the Blood, the church overlooking the cinema.

The Temple on the Blood is no accidental place of worship. It is built on the grounds of the old Ipatiev merchant house, the site of the Romanovs’ execution – or rather 20m away, since architects thought that spot more impressive. Today, it is no less than a shrine to Nicholas II. Filled with icons and paintings of the Romanovs, it contains a replica cellar, and an extensive exhibition exalting the peace-loving, saintly nature of the tsar redeemer. A simple cross marking the actual location of the merchant house is, naturally, ignored by parishioners.

The temple has served as a regular backdrop for protests against the film. One of the leaders of the pickets, a former boxer called Sergei Aliyev, even directed his own documentary response to the film, called The Lies of Matilda. Through a series of monologues with “experts”, the film claims to prove an anti-Russian conspiracy to undermine the tsar.

When we speak, Mr Aliyev asks if The Independent is a “moral publication”. The media has “subordinated itself to the masons of the United States and Europe”, he reasons. As a former analytics officer of Yekaterinburg’s police force, he says he knows what he was talking about.

Mr Aliyev’s problem with the film is basic. “Just imagine someone makes a film showing your mother as a prostitute and your father a German gay-porn actor,” he says. “Go inside the church, look at the lord tsar’s blue eyes and you’ll see how moral he is.”

The Temple on the Blood is, in fact, one of two local congregations most commonly associated with the city’s tsar worshippers. The other seat of the movement is the Sredneuralsk women’s monastery, located on the edge of town near the Ganina Yama complex.

The Sredneuralsk monastery boasts one of the largest followings of any in Russia. Every week, hundreds of pilgrims come here, all seeking the healing guidance of its secretive 62-year-old leader; a priest going by the name of Father Sergei.

In real life, Father Sergei is Nikolai Romanov – he changed his name to match the tsar, of course. He has a colourful past. A former policeman, he has several criminal convictions, and has spent 13 years in a prison colony – the documents say for murder, though his supporters dispute this.

After being released at the end of the 1990s, Father Sergei claims to have traversed the 140km from the Nizhny Tagil colony to Yekaterinburg on foot, wondering deep thoughts about his future.

From there, the biography becomes hazy. Little is known about how Father Sergei got to know church leaders, how he rose so remarkably fast in the hierarchy, or how, in 2002, he came to be the man who built the Ganina Yama complex. Some say he is the spiritual confessor to Timur Sverdlovsky, the nephew of “Grandpa Hassan”, linchpin of Russia’s criminal underworld until his untimely death in 2013.

What isn’t disputed is his role as confessor to the prominent Russian politician and former Crimean attorney general Natalya Poklonskaya.

Ms Poklonskaya, who married in the monastery, has played a leading role in the radical religious reaction against Matilda. She has also frequently appeared alongside Father Sergei, including when the priest made a televised trip to Crimea in July 2014, three months after the disputed annexation.

Set inside woodlands, the Sredneuralsk monastery is by now a well-developed set of living quarters and temples. There are three active temples – one, naturally with a cellar room in homage to the Romanovs – and a huge, brick temple with golden domes that is currently under construction. There are JCBs, heavy machinery and a fatigued Kamaz army truck at the entrance. A graveyard extends down into the birch forest.

Russian State Duma member Natalia Poklonskaya says because Nicholas II is a saint, his private life is off-limits

Fifteen years ago, things were very different. The only residents in the area were farmers Sergei Krekov and his wife Daniya Suleimenova, who set up a small farmstead in 1989, alongside the site of the future monastery. Speaking with The Independent in Moscow, Ms Suleimenova says the family were never rich, and the post-Soviet 1990s were hard. But they produced enough eggs, meat and milk to sell locally and scrape a living.

The farmers’ world changed on 3 June 2002, the day when Father Sergei and future monastery managers arrived on the territory. First, they noticed subtle changes; the locks on the main gates had been switched. By evening, they were under little doubt about the strange future that lay ahead. Washing up after dinner, Ms Sulemeinova looked up from the sink to find two dozen nuns standing in front of her window.

“They stood there, staring at me, with their icons, crossing themselves, reading prayers,” she says. “They circled around the house; devil this, devil that. And then they put a cross outside our toilet.”

The ritual became a daily event, says Ms Suleimenova. She tried to negotiate. Every few weeks, there would be a visit, they would agree to be friends, but the pressure would be ratcheted up again. Soon, the already elderly couple began to experience sporadic problems with electricity and water supply; in 2008, it was cut off completely. Ms Suleimenova says she and her husband have been forced to abandon the property.

“I understand it’s funny, bizarre,” she says. “I’d be laughing too if I didn’t have to live through it.”

Today, Father Sergei is out of town and The Independent’s attempts to speak with the monastery’s management are given short shrift. He’s gone to visit his remote forest sketes, says a senior nun, who would not give her name. Nobody had been “blessed” to speak to us, she says nervously, and Father Sergei really didn’t like the media sniffing around. The nun, a rounded woman of about 40, scuttles off to the main temple.

Darkness has fallen, and the sharp bite of early Siberian winter is beginning to let itself be known. The sounds of bells and female voices repeating prayer mantras begin to echo across the territory. From time to time, black shadows emerge from the darkness, but they disappear just as quickly. We seem to have been transported back three centuries.

At half past six, perhaps a hundred black shadows appear from inside the temple. They scuttle across the ice at unfathomable speed, up the slope towards the monastery gates. Screams. Shrieks. Cries. Within a moment, the object of the nuns’ excitement becomes clear, as five Cossack soldiers emerge from the gates carrying a huge icon.

The nuns raise their arms and shriek some more, before following the men and muttering mantras as they make their way back towards the temple.

One inside, the new icon is raised at the altar, among the icons of Nicholas and his family. A woman hurls herself to the ground, and begins moaning, convulsing. Her cries grow. Others join in. The mantras become louder, more spine-tingling.

Cossack soldiers pass notes to the senior nun; there is money rolled up in them. Are they donations? Maybe. How can anybody understand what is going on?

It takes a while, but eventually, a frail nun called Mother Antonina, perhaps 60 years old, begins to speak. This was a magical place, she says: “One of the priests told us that he’d seen the tsar wandering in the grounds – for real, but don’t say I told you.”

We’d missed the main show, of course, the exorcisms. Every morning, while Father Sergei is in residence, they begin at six o’clock sharp.

Being the only monastery in the region offering such cleansing of the soul, people come here from all around, says Mother Antonina. They’ve come from Japan, India, Germany; there was one couple from Austria who since left for one of Father Sergei’s forest sketes. There have been many visitors from Ukraine. Yes, there was one nice chap called Alexander who came from the Berkut riot police. He came a few years ago.

“My word, the Lord knows what happened to him,” she says. “First he was lying there, on a bench. Then he jumped from the bench at such a distance that he broke it – this is when Father Sergei cleansed him. The demon ran out of him, screaming and threatening him, shouting ‘I’ll show you, I’ll kick you’.”

Father Sergei seems to possess extraordinary powers over the nun, a presence that seeped deep into her professed opinions. At one point, Mother Antonina declares the Matilda film to be full of “powerful manipulations” that “make the 25th frame effect seem like yesterday’s technology”.

“How so?”

“Well… the viewer sees these images on the screen, and then they are projected… that’s what happens… roughly.”

“Sorry?”

“Perhaps you should speak to Father Sergei, he has the experts that come to visit him.”

With the priest away, Mother Antonina proposes we should speak to his wife. Could she call her? Not possible. There is only one mobile phone on the monastery and Mother Antonina is not “blessed” to use it. The nun leaves with a promise to search for someone we could talk to, but returns 20 minutes later with a worried face.

“I can’t speak with you,” she says. “I’m not blessed to speak to you.”

Part criminal, part shaman, part sect, the secretive edges of the tsar worshipper phenomenon would appear to ask many questions of both church and state. So far, both have seemed reluctant to act.

The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, while distancing himself from criticism of the Matilda film, failed to condemn the terrorist turn of the tsar worshippers in Yekaterinburg. Instead, he suggested the state should investigate “if a crime has been committed”.

Andrei Kurayev, a prominent and outspoken deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church, told The Independent that the Patriarch had an obligation to condemn such actions. “You aren’t attorneys, but priests,” he said. “You need to say if it is in line with the teachings of the Gospel or not.”

The Church seems no more ready to accept the weight of the Romanov burial fate. For historian Neuimin, its leaders are too “scared” to entertain a major climbdown. “If they recognise the remains, and hit at the heart of this movement, they will show themselves to be idiots,” he says.

Another complicating factor is the extent to which local business has been supporting the movement. Whether in the Ganina Yama complex, constructed so obviously on a historical untruth, or in support for Father Sergei’s activities in Sredneuralsk, or in the riches of the Temple on the Blood, or in any number of advertising boards declaring the “redemption” of the Romanovs that have been displayed around the city in recent years, it is clear that local businessmen have been a major pillar of support for the tsar worshippers.

What seems less clear is why they are doing it. Perhaps, here, the scale of the movement might offer clues. This year’s nocturnal pilgrimage to Ganina Yama was attended by no less than 25,000. The number of tsar worshippers is likely to be many times more.

Deacon Kurayev suggests that control might also be at the heart of the church’s thinking.

“The church is taking a cynical, manipulative stand,” he says. “The Patriarch wants to be the leader of all Russia’s angry people. He wants to keep them his own.”"

Ms Brand, who was guest host on the BBC show, responded: “If I can just say – as the only representative of the female gender here today – I know it’s not high-level, but it doesn’t have to be high-level for women to feel under siege in somewhere like the House of Commons.

At another point during the show, journalist Quentin Letts called broadcaster Julia Hartley-Brewer ""a big strong girl"".

Where's the F in News will host a predominantly female panel, who will use current affairs as a ""starting point for a number of fresh and funny challenges"".

A spreadsheet compiled by Tory aides featuring a wide range of allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by Conservative MPs was leaked last Sunday. While some of the allegations are serious, a number of claims relate to consensual relationships.

A number of other sexual harassment allegations have been levelled at politicians in recent days.

The Conservative Party said it had suspended the whip from the MP Charlie Elphicke after what it called serious allegations had been referred to the police. Mr Elphicke criticised his party on Twitter, saying it ""tipped off the press before telling me of my suspension"". He added: ""I am not aware of what the alleged claims are and deny wrongdoing"".

It came after Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon resigned on Wednesday saying he had ""fallen below the high standards"" required of the armed forces. Downing Street was presented with details of an alleged sexual assault by hours before he resigned on Wednesday, The Times reported on Saturday.

It came as part of a series of sweeping changes by the Middle Eastern nation’s King Salman who removed one of the royal family's most prominent members as head of the National Guard and boosted the kingdom's young crown prince.

None of those detained were named and it is unclear what, if any, charges they face. But Saudi broadcaster Al-Arabiya reported that new investigations had been launched into the 2009 Jeddah floods and the Mers virus outbreak in 2012.

The cabinet reshuffle saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah replaced as minister of the National Guard by Khaled bin Ayyaf.

Prince Miteb, the preferred son of the late King Abdullah, was once thought to be a leading contender for the throne before the unexpected rise of Prince Mohammed two years ago.

He had inherited control of the National Guard, an elite internal security force built out of traditional tribal units, from his father, who ran it for five decades.

He was the last remaining member of Abdullah's branch of the family to hold a position in the upper echelons of the Saudi power structure.

Prince Mohammed, the king's 32-year-old son, already serves as defence minister and was named heir to the throne in a June reshuffle that sidelined his older cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef who had also served as interior minister.

2/10 In March 2015, Yemen’s Sunni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi was forced into exile after a Shia-led insurgency. A Saudi Arabia-led coalition has responded with air strikes in order to reinstate Mr Hadi. It has since been accused of committing war crimes in the country. Getty Images

4/10 Members of the Kingdom’s Shia minority, most of whom live in the oil-rich Eastern Province, continue to face discrimination that limits their access to government services and employment. Activists have received death sentences or long prison terms for their alleged participation in protests in 2011 and 2012. Getty Images

5/10 All public gatherings are prohibited under an order issued by the Interior Ministry in 2011. Those defy the ban face arrest, prosecution and imprisonment on charges such as “inciting people against the authorities”. Getty Images

6/10 In March 2014, the Interior Ministry stated that authorities had deported over 370,000 foreign migrants and that 18,000 others were in detention. Thousands of workers were returned to Somalia and other states where they were at risk of human rights abuses, with large numbers also returned to Yemen, in order to open more jobs to Saudi Arabians. Many migrants reported that prior to their deportation they had been packed into overcrowded makeshift detention facilities where they received little food and water and were abused by guards.

9/10 Dawood al-Marhoon was arrested aged 17 for participating in an anti-government protest. After refusing to spy on his fellow protestors, he was tortured and forced to sign a blank document that would later contain his ‘confession’. At Dawood’s trial, the prosecution requested death by crucifixion while refusing him a lawyer. Getty Images

10/10 Ali Mohammed al-Nimr was arrested in 2012 aged either 16 or 17 for participating in protests during the Arab spring. His sentence includes beheading and crucifixion. The international community has spoken out against the punishment and has called on Saudi Arabia to stop. He is the nephew of a prominent government dissident. Getty

He has been responsible at the same time for running Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, dictating an energy policy with global implications and behind the plans for the kingdom to build a future after oil.

Prince Mohammed, who has pledged to go after corruption at the highest levels, will now also head up the new anti-corruption body, which was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and freeze assets.

""The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,"" the royal decree said.

The move consolidates Crown Prince Mohammed's control of the kingdom's security institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Emily Heller,Yeah we're obsessed.,2017-11-04T16:43:38.521Z,mashable,Amazon has a beautiful new mid-century modern furniture line,http://mashable.com/2017/11/04/amazon-furniture-line-rivet/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Z5QI5n1jIbvvrVp5YCIvVjkbfzc=/1200x630/2017%2F11%2F04%2F21%2Ff41e5c393bd94812aff7bcb231ec1f7f.4fbea.jpg,entertainment,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Just to let you know, if you buy something featured here, Mashable might earn an affiliate commission.

Amazon appears to be hellbent on dominating the world of retail from the mundane grocery stores to (possibly) high-stakes cryptocurrency trading.

Amazon has saved most of their marketing hype for smart devices like the Fire tablets and new versions of the Echo, and the (frankly alarming) Amazon Key delivery service. Their home goods line, Rivet, had a much quieter debut, but it's actually got some really nice pieces.

Rivet's collection definitely wouldn't look out of place in a West Elm catalogue. The style is distinctly mid-century modern. It also seems to be designed with small spaces in mind as most of the furniture is streamlined and multi-functional. Hidden compartments abound and the fabrics and colors look expensive though prices are reasonable. Think somewhere between Ikea and Pottery Barn.

The entire collection is worth taking a look, but we're sharing some of our favorites to serve as inspiration (and it conveniently doubles as a gift list, hint hint.) BTW, Amazon offers a 1-year warranty on all Rivet furniture and has a free 30-day return policy so you can shop stress-free.

A plush sofa

Image: rivet

This velvet couch is so gorgeous, we'd design a whole room around it. It's subtle enough to fit in with your current decor, though. We love navy as a non-boring neutral, but it also comes in ecru and pewter if that fits your style better. The metal legs are another interesting touch that doesn't draw too much attention. The Emerly collection also includes a chair, loveseat, sectional, and ottoman.

An ottoman bed

Image: rivet

Move over pullout couches, there's a new sofa bed in town. The Fold is at first glance a simple, if very pretty, ottoman to rest your feet on. But when you have an overnight guest, the top folds back to reveal a pull-out twin bed. The folded panels even function as a headboard.

An expandable media console

Image: rivet

On its own, the asymmetrical cabinet looks a little wonky, but it somehow just works in this room. It's also super versatile. If you've got a smaller space you can slide the pieces together but if you have a larger media room you can expand it to fit your TV, all of your gaming consoles and streaming devices, plus DVDs, books, and/or records (if you still have any of those.)

A floor lamp charging station

Image: rivet

If you don't yet have any furniture with built-in charging stations, welcome to the future, my friend. This stylish brass and wood lamp has a small shelf built into the pole with a USB charging port. You can just plug in your charger and leave your phone on the shelf for streamlined power. Plus, it opens up more coveted outlet space for your other devices.

Rugs for everyone

Image: rivet

Nothing pulls a room together like a good rug. Rivet has tons of options available from minimalist and modern to classic but still chic. This distressed medallion rug is our favorite because it's a little of both.

Don't forget the walls

Image: rivet

To really tie the collection together, Rivet is also selling wall art in a variety of styles. Since the furniture collection is so effortless, the artwork provides a fun pop that completes the whole look rather than pulling focus. From graphic prints to sweeping canvas landscapes, we're having trouble picking our favorites since they're all so different but weirdly complimentary of each other. Check out the entire collection of wall art here.

You really can't beat the convenience of Amazon and if this is the quality they're coming with, other furniture stores should be shaking in their boots. Check out the full Rivet line here."

Small messes are constant, but big upright vacuums are possibly the most inconvenient appliance to have if your living space is limited.

Stop using a crappy dustpan and get your hands on this sleek looking handheld Dyson DC34 that happens to be $70 off right now.

Though it's just a handheld, this puppy uses Dyson's Root Cyclone technology, so you can count on the suction staying powerful throughout cleaning. Not only is it super strong for a handheld vacuum, but it's bagless and has an easy-empty hygienic bin instead — because we all know touching hairy vacuum bags is just plain gross. Recharge it when necessary and skip dealing with tangled cords all together.

Pick one up for yourself or as a holiday gift for the sale price of $99.99 here."

That's a tale as old as time —and the secret behind some of Hollywood's most successful and resonant stories.

There are a lot of things you'd compare Stranger Things to before Harry Potter, but Season 2 has the kind of similarities that won't escape an observant Potter fan. They're not terribly obvious references, but that's what makes them even more fun to spot and appreciate.





Devil’s Snare

Hopper gets caught in the tangled roots (arms?) of the shadow monster below Hawkins, and it starts to wrap around him like the Devil’s Snare that Harry, Ron, and Hermione encounter in the first Harry Potter book. Hey Hopper, did you try sunlight?





Will's visions

same Image: netflix

Once he’s host to the “shadow monster,” Will isn’t entirely himself. ""It's like I feel what the shadow monster is feeling, see what he's seeing,"" Will says. He can see and feel the monster alongside his own consciousness, the same way Harry can sense Voldemort’s emotions and see into his mind. But at least Harry didn't use the term ""now-memories.""

A horcrux among us

Speaking of Harry's connection to Voldemort, Will being host has some nasty side effects, like the beginning of episode 6 when his in agonizing pain because people from the lab tried to ignite the Mind Flayer's underground lair. He says it hurts ""everywhere,"" but there's no physical indication of pain; the worst pain Harry experienced in the series was in book five during the battle at the Department of Mysteries:

And then Harry's scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance –

He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creature's began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape...Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the creature use him again...

This sounds unpleasant! But the secret, as Harry learns and Will needs to figure out, is love.

The angry young man

So troubled. Image: Netlflix

Not that Harry was ever anywhere near Billy, but Max describes her brother as “angry all the time” – the same words Harry uses to describe himself in the film version of Order of the Phoenix. Billy makes book 5 Harry look like a walk in the park.

A vaporous villain

During the finale, the season's underwhelming de facto villain, the Mind Flayer, leaves Will’s body in a cloud of ominous black smoke. You know who else did that? VOLDEMORT, and he sure as hell came back. At least Will fared better than Professor Quirrell...for now anyway.

Stranger Things 2 is now streaming on Netflix."

The secret cabal of television industry leaders and tastemakers has gotten together and decided that the next big thing in TV technology is 4K. But 4K isn’t really that innovative. Sure, it’s a slightly higher resolution and it makes already really blue water look a little bit bluer, but HD resolution is already pretty good and most content isn’t even available in 4K yet.

However, there is a brand new technology that dramatically improves the TV watching experience and doesn’t even require buying a new TV set: the DreamScreen HDTV Backlighting Kit.

See the DreamScreen in action. Image: Dreamscreen

DreamScreen puts LEDs behind your TV that respond to the color of whatever you’re watching on the front. Sometimes they’re the same color, like when you’re watching an explosion, and sometimes they’re a complementary color so the picture on your TV pops more. Regardless, the screen will feel larger, the picture will be softened, and the content will be more immersive than ever. It’s the perfect add-on for any TV show, movie, or video game.

DreamScreen comes with 3 HDMI inputs so it’s easy to toggle between multiple video sources. In addition to the lights that go behind your TV, the Total Surround Kit also comes with lights that you can place all around the room – like surround sound, but for light.

Check out DreamScreen in action:

DreamScreen has an iOS and Android app so you can completely customize the way everything looks. You can also use it with an audio visualizer to create a groovy, psychedelic experience for your next party. Or, you can set it to ambient mode so it just looks like one giant, hypnotic light.

DreamScreen Kits normally start at $169.99, but you can get one now for just $139.99, a savings of 17%."

Ok, let’s all just admit it. We’ve all had Microsoft Office under “skills” on our resumes for the last decade. And once we actually get an assignment that requires it, then the Googling starts. And the panicking. And the sweating.

If you want to actually learn Microsoft Office (and not in the sweaty, panicky, Googling way), take a gander at eLearnExcel + eLearnOffice from IACT. They’ve got a lifetime subscription available to both their Excel School and complete Office School, depending on what you need to brush up on.

The program has lessons in Microsoft Word, Excel, OneNote, OneDrive, Outlook, Access, and Calendar, with bite-sized video lessons, quizzes that test your knowledge, and easy access to the Microsoft-approved experts who teach the classes. And since a lot of businesses rely on Excel for making sense of data, the program includes intensive training on just Excel, too.

Access to the Excel School and Office School usually goes for over $1,000 separately, but right now you can get an extra 20% off the already discounted price of $49 when you enter code OFFICE20 at the Mashable Shop."

Negotiation is a skill that you probably need to use more than you think. Whether you're buying a house, gunning for a raise, or just trying to get your toddler to finish her vegetables, being an effective negotiator can save you money, boost your confidence, and generally make life a lot easier.

This course on Udemy gives you the tools you need to negotiate like a pro. Starting with getting over the embarrassment and imposter syndrome many people feel around negotiation and closing with when to walk away, the 40-lecture course covers every aspect of the negotiating process.

You'll learn terminology used in negotiation as well as tactics that might be used against you and how to combat them. Ideally by the end of the course you'll have both the skills and the confidence you need to walk out of your next meeting with the results you're looking for.

The Successful Negotiation course is available on Udemy for $95. I don't think you can negotiate with Udemy, but keep an eye out because they have sales a lot."

Kids destroy things. It's what they do. When they're not breaking things they're getting them sticky or coloring on them or trying to feed them to the dog. Handing your kid your own expensive tablet is a gamble every time, but if you buy them one it will definitely be broken at some point.

Amazon's ever-popular Fire tablets were updated this year to be thinner and lighter with longer battery life. That includes their Kids Edition tablet, which is a game-changer for parents. The Kids Edition isn't a toy like some other tablets for kids—it's a fully operational Fire tablet with a durable ""kid-proof"" case.

The Fire Kids Edition comes with a free year of their subscription service geared towards families, FreeTime Unlimited. (After that it's $83/year for Prime members.) In addition to tons of kid-friendly content, FreeTime unlimited lets parents set time limits and bedtimes. The Learn First feature can even block access to games and videos until educational goals are met.

The most important feature, though, is the two-year worry-free guarantee. If the tablet is broken within two years, Amazon will replace it, no questions asked. You have to return to one they broke, though, so if it's just lost you're out of luck.

Here's the thing: Amazon wants you to use their devices so you'll buy more stuff on them. That's how their business-model works. So is this a move to get you to keep paying for their subscription services and apps? Maybe. But it's also a way to let your digital native kids explore technology without worrying that they'll ruin your expensive devices.

The Kids Edition can be ordered in either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8 edition and the cases can be ordered in blue, pink and yellow.

No more sticky fingerprint smudges on your tablet will be worth it."

For the second year in a row, Donald Trump effigies have proven popular – but his is far from the only one being set alight.

In Lewes, there were several Kim Jong-un effigies, including one where naked Kim and Trump figures were strapped to a rocket.

The parade also included an effigy of Vladimir Putin wearing Borat’s mankini, and Theresa May as a Bond girl.

And in Edenbridge, the star of the show was a giant Harvey Weinstein effigy that everyone wanted to watch burn.

The terrifying figure was a whopping 36ft tall – and the sight of it burning makes for an immensely satisfying image.

Madeleine McCann vanished in 2007 (Picture: PA)

Detectives hoping to find out what happened to Madeleine McCann have travelled to Bulgaria to track down the wife of a convicted paedophile.

The new lead comes after Met detectives re-examined witness statements taken after Madeleine disappeared aged three.

They hope to interrogate the woman, whose husband was a paedophile but has died since Madeleine vanished in 2007, The Sun reported.

The couple were reportedly working as domestic helpers near the apartment in Portugal where the McCanns were staying on holiday.

However, they both vanished after the investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance was opened, it is claimed.

Detectives still believe they can solve the mystery (Picture: PA)

Locals in the Algarve reported them to the police, but despite extensive searches carried out in the following years, officers have been unable to find the woman.

A source told The Sun: ‘There is no evidence they were involved but it would be good to eliminate them from the investigation.’

The woman was allegedly seen close to the Ocean Club complex where the family were staying.

Police were recently given another £154,000 from the Home Office, allowing them to continue the search."

Muslim women are most likely to be targets of Islamophobia (Picture: Getty)

The majority of Muslims who are targeted in racist attacks on the streets are women, a new report has found.

An annual study into Islamophobia by Tell MAMA (Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks) showed that there was a 4% rise in reports of abusive behaviour against Muslims in Britain.

Detectives travelling to Bulgaria in new Madeleine McCann probe

Women who wear traditional Islamic clothing, such as a hijab or niqab, were the most likely group to face abuse, Tell MAMA said.

The organisation said: ‘Given the impact of anti-Muslim hatred on the mobility of Muslim women and on the personal life choices that they make, the impacts are also felt within the family and have implications for integration and social cohesion.’

Its study found that 56% of Muslims who suffered incidents of abuse in person are women – making it the second year in a row its annual report found that women are more likely to be targeted than men.

The report found that those in traditional dress are the most likely to be attacked (Picture: Getty)

White men are most likely to launch an attack, Tell MAMA said, with the group responsible for 69% of incidents where the attacker is identifiable.

According to female victims of Islamophobia, the language of many attackers had misogynistic overtones, meaning they were assaulted for their gender as well as their religion.

In total, the number of street-based incidents reported in Britain in 2016 rose from 437 in 2015 to 642.

Hundreds of other attacks happened online, the organisation added.

Tell MAMA also urged anyone witnessing anti-Muslim abuse to step in and intervene.

It said: ‘A lack of intervention from members of the public during incidents, especially on public transport, can compound the deeper psychological impact that a hate crime can have on a person, compared to equivalent non-aggravated offences.’"

The U.S. president’s daughter and adviser spoke at the World Assembly for Women amid growing attention to sexual harassment of women in Hollywood and the Westminster sexual harassment allegations.

‘All too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect,’ she said. ‘This takes many forms including harassment which can never be tolerated.’

She did not give examples and she also appeared to forget that her father, President Donald Trump, has been accused of sexual harassment and groping by multiple women.

In her speech, she also said workplaces need to make further efforts to respect women’s values and accommodate the need for balance between work and family.

Despite the increase in the percentage of women at workplaces, corporate expectations have remained ‘stagnant’ and still operate on ‘a single-honor mindset’ with expectations for mothers to stay home to provide full-time care, she said.

‘This isn’t a woman’s issue, it’s a family issue,’ she said.

He later invited her to dinner, and when she met him at his hotel, Zervos said, Trump almost immediately began kissing her and placed his hand on her breasts. Kristin Anderson, 46, told The Washington Post that she was sitting on a couch with friends at a New York nightclub in the early 1990s when someone reached up her skirt and touched her through her underwear. Anderson, then in her early 20s, said she pushed the hand away, turned around and recognized Trump as the man who had groped her. Jessica Leeds, 74, told The New York Times that Trump groped her on an airplane more than three decades ago. Leeds says the two were seated next to each other when Trump lifted the armrest separating them and began to touch her, grabbing her breasts and trying to put his hand up her skirt.

Stoynoff wrote in an article published on the magazine’s website that Trump was giving her a tour of his Mar-a-Lago mansion when he said he wanted to show her a special room. He shut the door ‘and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat.’ Rachel Crooks claims she was inappropriately touched by Trump Rachel Crooks says Trump kissed her without invitation in 2006 when she was a 22-year-old receptionist for a real estate firm located at Trump Tower. Crooks told the Times she was meeting Trump for the first time when he took her hand to shake it and would not let go. He began kissing her cheeks and then kissed her on the mouth, she told the paper. Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah, says Trump kissed her on the mouth more than once when she was a 21-year-old contestant in his Miss USA beauty pageant. Taggart initially told her story to the Times in May. She said she was struck by how Trump’s comments from the 2005 video mirrored her experience. Jill Harth, a former business associate, told the Times that Trump put his hands under her skirt during a business dinner in 1992 and, on another occasion, tried to force himself on her. Harth sued Trump accusing him of sexual harassment in 1997. She dropped the lawsuit after he settled a separate breach of contract suit. Cathy Heller told The Guardian newspaper that Trump tried to kiss her on the mouth when he was introduced to her along with other guests at a Mother’s Day brunch at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, some 20 years ago. She said she extended her hand and that he took it, then grabbed her and ‘went for the lips’. She leaned backward and almost lost her balance, she says, and turned her head at the last minute, and he kissed her on the side of her mouth. She was left ‘angry and shaken’, she said.

When the allegations surfaced Metro.co.uk reached out to Donald Trump’s reps for comment on the claims. Communications Director Jessica Ditto, told us: ‘Discredited political operative Gloria Allred, in another coordinated, publicity seeking attack with the Clinton campaign, will stop at nothing to smear Mr. Trump. Give me a break. Voters are tired of these circus-like antics and reject these fictional stories and the clear efforts to benefit Hillary Clinton.’

Arconic, formely known as Alcoa, made a component in the cladding used on the west London tower.

Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service (DSFRS) was called to reports of a fire at the production plant in Kestral Way.

The fire service said: ‘Due to the potential serious nature of this incident and knowledge of the type of building involved, fire control made the decision to redirect fire appliances from other lower priority incidents in the area to ensure fire service resources were in attendance as soon as possible.’

A DSFRS spokesman added: ‘At 02:44am the incident commander reported that the fire was believed to be out, and at 02:50am it was confirmed that the fire had been extinguished.

The Radio 2 star has strongly denied the claims, and said he was a victim of a witch-hunt.

The BBC told Metro.co.uk: ‘We take these issues very seriously and are committed to dealing with matters responsibly and fairly when they are raised with us. We wouldn’t comment on individuals but the matters raised do not relate to a BBC programme and date back more than 20 years, and press reports in 2016 stated that the police investigated – including interviewing under caution – and concluded that there was insufficient evidence.

‘For these reasons we do not think that the BBC could have relevant information relating to the allegations made. If an individual has information that might change the police’s judgement, then that would be a matter to raise directly with them.’

MP Andrew Bridgen said he was ‘appalled’ that the BBC had tried to ‘sweep these very serious allegations under the carpet’.

He added: ‘Michael Fallon has just resigned from the government over allegations he put his hand on a woman’s knee 15 years ago.

‘Therefore when and where Chris Evans is alleged to have exposed himself to this woman is utterly irrelevant.

‘Post-Jimmy Savile, the BBC should be whiter than white. I know I’m not alone in wondering if Chris Evans is a fit and proper person to work at the BBC.’

Reps have been contacted for comment.

Harriet Harman said the scandal has not been blown out of proportion (Picture: PA)

The Westminster sexual harassment scandal is ‘not a witch hunt’ and has not been blown out of proportion, Labour’s Harriet Harman has said.

Several male MPs have faced accusations of wrongdoing, while an unverified list documenting sexual harassment by MPs has been circulated on social media.

A number of politicians have denied the allegations, and the saga has been described as a witch hunt.

However, Ms Harman told the BBC: ‘There are a lot of men saying this has been blown out of all proportion, it’s a witch hunt. No, it’s not a witch hunt, it’s long overdue.’

The former Labour deputy leader told BBC Radio 4’s Week in Westminster: ‘If you point your finger at a powerful man, they won’t just sit there, they will fight back.

I’m a Celeb host Ant McPartlin has been spending time at a rented house as he battles to save his 23-year relationship with wife Lisa.

The pad is just a few streets from the £6million mansion he and Lisa have shared for years.

He has been spotted wearing his wedding ring – but Lisa, the love of his life, has been seen without hers.

Bearded Ant, 41, yesterday collected pet labrador Hurley from the couple’s West London home. He spent 15 minutes there before leaving with the pooch.

Shortly after, top TV make-up artist Lisa left in a people carrier – understood to be on her way to BBC studios for last night’s Strictly Come Dancing.

Lisa, also 41, is adored by the show’s stars who credit her and her make-up team for their dazzling looks.

An onlooker who saw Ant arrive at the marital home early yesterday morning said: “He arrived on foot with another bloke and waited for the gates to open.

“He seemed a little apprehensive, then he and the guy went in.

“He was unshaven and had black bags under his eyes. After he left, Lisa came out a few minutes later looking tired.

“They both looked really sad. I feel so sorry for them both. They look like they’re having such a hard time.”

The Sunday Mirror can reveal Ant slipped back into Britain from Los Angeles after latest month-long stint for pills addiction.

But even though he is only back home briefly before flying off to Australia for I’m A Celeb, he has been spending time at the four-bed rented house near his own home.

The £1.6million rental is registered in the name of a private company. It was advertised online but a website now says it is no longer available.

Ant’s fans have been willing him to get well and hoping his marriage can be mended. However, new pictures show the strain’s taking its toll on both of them.

Lisa cut a forlorn figure while walking Hurley – without her wedding band. She was last seen wearing the ring on October 17 – while giving viewers a make-up tutorial on Strictly spin-off show Strictly: It Takes Two.

An onlooker said: “She looked like she had the weight of her world on her shoulders as she walked through the park. She genuinely looked upset. It was very sad.”

Ant’s mum Christine joined Lisa and has also been at her son’s side. In one picture he is carrying a brace which he has used for his troublesome right knee.

Our exclusive pictures come just three months after Ant admitted he had put Lisa “through hell” after he became dependent on booze and prescription drugs. The star, one half of Britain’s most popular TV duo with pal Declan Donnelly, 42, is preparing to head Down Under for the 17th series of I’m A Celeb. It starts on November 19.

Ant and Lisa, who wed in 2006, have spent long spells apart, including eight weeks when he went into rehab for drug and alcohol dependency in June.

He had become hooked on prescription pills after a botched knee op in 2015.

The couple were separated again when he jetted off to LA for another spell of recovery five weeks ago. And within days they will be on different continents for another four weeks as the much-loved Geordie flies to Australia with pal Dec.

Speaking after leaving rehab in August, Ant told of his regret at putting Lisa through such a tough time.

He praised her for coping “brilliantly”, but confessed the ordeal had put a strain on their relationship.

He said: “I’ve put Lisa through hell with mood swings and depression and how it affects you. I’m very sorry about the effect it has on partners. This kind of stuff puts strains on any marriage.”

Asked at the time if he thought their marriage would emerge unscathed, he admitted: “All I can say at the moment is that she’s been amazing – fantastic throughout. She’s been very supportive. Time will tell.”

The Britain’s Got Talent star was pictured without his wedding ring two months ago, but is now wearing it again.

And it is understood he is desperate to save their marriage.

The Sunday Mirror last week revealed how he was given extra time to rest after an I’m A Celeb promo shoot was shelved.

But ITV bosses have confirmed filming of the jungle series will continue as planned. Cast and crew fly out next weekend. Thanking fans for their support after Ant first revealed his addictions, Lisa wrote on Twitter: “Completely overwhelmed by all your love & support, it means so much. I’m relieved he’s receiving the help he needs, we just need him better.”

Lisa and Ant fell for each other after meeting while performing on the Smash Hits tour in Newcastle in 1994.

Ant was 18 and one half of music act PJ and Duncan – with Dec. Lisa was 17 and part of the band Deuce. They dated for 11 years before Ant finally popped the question on holiday in Dubai in April 2005.

They tied the knot a year later at a country church in Taplow, Bucks, in front of more than 150 friends and family. Dec was best man.

But despite fame and fortune the couple have been unable to fulfil their dream of having kids.

Ant – who received an OBE from the Queen for services to broadcasting in January – spoke openly about his addiction battle in June.

The worried star also revealed he had been diagnosed as suffering from clinical depression.

Ant admitted becoming hooked on booze and a cocktail of drugs, including tramadol, known as “Hillbilly Crack” as well as morphine, diazepam and codeine.

He finally realised he needed help when he had to be rushed to hospital after begging Lisa to call an ambulance.

Ant said: “I was at the point where anything — prescription drugs, non-prescription drugs — I would take.

“And take them with alcohol, which is ridiculous. The doctors told me: ‘You could have killed yourself’.”"

A suspected serial sex attacker was being hunted by police last night after two women were dragged into bushes and molested just seven hours apart.

In both attacks, a man pounced from behind before pulling the terrified women to the ground and into the seclusion of nearby bushes where he tried to take off their clothes.

The first woman was saved by her dog who barked and became aggressive towards the man while in the second attack, just nine miles down the road, the woman fought the man off and managed to get away.

The attacker, described as aged in his 30s in both incidents, ran away.

Last night, detectives said they were investigation whether the two sex assaults, one of which was being treated as attempted rape, are linked.

The first attempted rape was committed just before 6pm on Thursday evening in a park in Winnersh, near Reading, Berks.

The second sex assault happened just seven hours later, and around nine miles away, at 1am on Friday in Bracknell, Berks.

Detective Inspector Jason Liles of the Force Intelligence Hub warned people to be vigilant and said: ""We are investigating whether the two incidents are linked.

""I also understand that people in the community will be concerned about these two incidents.

""We are in the process of conducting an investigation into both incidents, and I would encourage anyone who has any information which could help to please come forward.

""I would also ask members of the public in this area to be extra vigilant and to contact police if they see anything which they think could be suspicious.

The 25-year-old victim of the most recent attack in Coopers Hill, Bracknell, Berks., was described by investigating officers as brave after she was approached from behind by a white man wearing a dark blue jumper.

""He grabbed her and dragged her towards a bush where he attempted to remove her clothing,"" said the spokesman.

""However, the victim managed to get away from the offender and ran from the scene. She was not injured as a result of the incident.""

Detective Inspector Liles said: ""The victim of this incident showed great bravery in managing to get away from this offender, and she is being supported by specially trained officers following what was an extremely frightening experience.""

The first attack on a 36-year-old dog walker happened in a park behind Dunstans Drive, Winnersh, near Reading, Berks., on Thursday evening at 5.55pm.

The police spokesman said: ""He pulled the victim to the ground and attempted to remove her clothes. However, the victim's dog became aggressive towards him and he then fled the scene. The victim was not injured in the incident.""

The attacker was described as around 5ft 7ins tall, was clean shaven, with tanned skin and dark hair. He was wearing a black hooded top and black or navy jogging bottoms.

At the time Detective Chief Inspector Matt Stone said: ""This was a very distressing and traumatic experience for the victim and she is being supported by specially trained officers at this time.

""I understand that people in the area will be very concerned about this incident, but I would like to reassure them that we have begun a full and thorough investigation.

""A scenewatch is in place at the park, and members of the public may see an increased police presence in the area while an investigation is carried out.

""I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area at this time."""

We revealed in 2015 how Andrew Ridgeley of Wham! and his partner of 25 years, Bananarama’s Keren Woodward, split then got back together.

But, sadly, I have to report that they’ve separated again.

Their relationship was once seen as one of the most enduring in the music world, but it seems this time it’s over for good.

“It wasn’t really working for either of us,” Andrew, 54, tells me. “As close friends, with different lives, we see each other as circumstances allow and retain a great affection for one another.”

Keren, 56, revealed she has been living in London since August, saying: “Yes, we’ve gone our separate ways. These things happen unfortunately, but we still speak.

“In fact, I saw him recently when I was back home in Cornwall.

(Image: PA)

""He’s actually coming to quite a few of the dates on the new Bananarama tour.”

Keren has reunited with former bandmates Sara Dallin and Siobhan Fahey ahead of a huge UK tour.

She said: “I didn’t ever really consider that the three of us would get back together again. There were a lot of reasons why it came about.

""There were a lot of things that happened – like when you start losing people – that made me think life is too short.

Caitlin Moran set a perfect example by proudly showing her flab during book signing

“The reunion tour is like a celebration of our friendship really.”

In a previous interview, she told how Andrew was happier to take a back seat while she performed and revealed that his Wham! partner, the late George Michael, loved to visit them in Cornwall."

Jeremy McConnell has secretly had a beard transplant as he prepares to return to the spotlight.

Stephanie Davis' ex jetted off to Turkey for a break from community service but he had some cosmetic procedures done in secret.

The shamed Irish model is covered in blood around his beard and hairline after he underwent a hair transplant and work on his teeth.

And it's all so that he can ""look his best"" for his comeback next year.

""Jeremy has a lot of exciting projects on the cards in 2018 and he wants to look the best he can,"" a source told The Sun .

""As well as recently having his teeth done, he's now had a full hair and beard transplant.""

Last month, Jeremy shared pictures from his luxury break to Turkey as he soaked up the sun by the pool.

The 27 year old appeared in good spirits as he slapped on his tinted sunglasses and left his shirt open for the snap, exposing his tattooed torso.

Former Celebrity Big Brother star Jeremy recently revealed how he'd taken a break from his busy schedule of cleaning graffiti off walls to jet off on a lads' holiday to Turkey.

McConnell also shared snaps of him and his friends chilling out in the sauna, wearing nothing but towels wrapped around their waists with their heavily tattooed torsos on show.

The latest social media activity is unlikely to calm fans' fears that Jeremy is heading off the rails, after pals of his told Mirror Online they're worried he'll end up behind bars after Snapchat videos this week saw him partying in a hotel room with what looked like suspicious white powder laid out on a table.

Strictly Come Dancing viewers have blasted Alexandra Burke for her 'fake' reaction to tonight's score.

The X Factor winner received heavy praise from the judges for her Cha Cha Cha, which head judge Shirley Ballas said was the ""best this season"".

Alexandra was denied the perfect score of 40 by Craig Revel-Horwood, who couldn't bring himself to award a 10, so viewers were annoyed by her 'over reaction'.

She collapsed to the floor, screamed and stamped on professional partner Gorka Marquez's foot after receiving 39 from the judges as she opened the show.

(Image: BBC)

Bruno Tonioli said she had the ""sex appeal of Naomi Campbell"", while Craig praised her for finally having a turnout which he had been ""demanding all these weeks"".

After finishing her dance, an excited Alexandra said: ""I was petrified - and I didn’t know what turnout meant, I didn’t know if it was good or bad.

""I’m so happy. I thought he was going to say pigeon foot again.""

(Image: BBC)

Alexandra grabbed hold of Gorka and presenter Claudia Winkleman as the scores were read out.

She then fell to the ground in shock after Bruno awarded her a 10, taking her tally to 39 for the evening.

But in an unfortunate accident, she appeared to stamp on Gorka's foot and he keeled over in pain.

Claudia asked if he was alright, while Gemma Atkinson, who is rumoured to be dating Gorka, did not look happy at all.

Strictly viewers took to Twitter to slam Alexandra for her reaction to the scores.

One viewer said: ""Alexandra will always remain the Queen of the over reaction, did it on X Factor and now on Strictly #Strictly #SCD""

Another added: ""It’s actually quite painful to watch Alexandra Burke getting so overexcited every week, it comes across as really fake to me #Strictly""

A third said: ""Most over the top and fake act for getting a 10 goes to Alexandra Burke #strictly"""
Neil Batey,"Forensics expert Lorna Dawson, 59, has won a Pride Of Britain award for using cutting-edge technology to help convict a man who had got away with murder…",2017-11-03T11:09:03Z,mirror,How one Pride of Britain winner helped to solve a cold case,http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/pride-britain-winner-helped-catch-11457165,https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11431868.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/20171005_LORNA_006.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

Professor Lorna Dawson still shudders when she recalls the harrowing double murder that was to have such a profound impact on her life.

In October 1977, she was studying geography at Edinburgh University when two young girls – Helen Scott and Christine Eadie – were brutally killed after a night out at the city’s World’s End pub. The 17-year-olds had been beaten, gagged, tied, raped and strangled, their naked and battered bodies dumped in plain view.

""They were discarded like department store mannequins,"" says Lorna, 59. ""These were gruesome, callous murders. Helen and Christine were just innocent girls enjoying a fun night out, who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.""

For a country girl, new to Scotland’s capital city, they were shocking crimes and all the more disturbing because she could so easily have been a victim herself.

""I used to go drinking in the World’s End pub,"" she explains. ""And the park where the girls were raped was just a stone’s throw from my halls of residence. Fear gripped the community and spread right across Edinburgh, especially among young women. It really did change the way I socialised after that. I wouldn’t go out on my own, particularly at night.""

(Image: PA)

Despite a huge police manhunt, the World’s End murder case was scaled down after a year and no one was charged, with the killer remaining at large.

""Many had resigned the case to the category of unsolved murders,"" Lorna says. ""It felt so unfair that the killer would get away with such a horrible crime, particularly when you could see the anguish that the families of the victims were going through.""

In a curious twist of fate, Lorna, who by this stage was working as one of Britain’s leading forensic scientists, found herself drawn back into the investigation decades later.

In 2005, Scottish police charged a man called Angus Sinclair with the murder and rape of the two girls. However, a 2007 trial collapsed due to a lack of evidence. Then, in 2014, Lorna was approached by prosecutors to help solve this notorious cold case once and for all.

""It was almost as if my life had come full circle,"" explains Lorna. ""I had an emotional attachment to this case, going back to my student years in Edinburgh when I’d just started training for my career in science. It can be funny how life throws up these kind of connections.""

Huge breakthrough

Using revolutionary forensic techniques she herself has pioneered, Lorna examined tiny soil particles taken from Helen Scott’s feet and found vital incriminating evidence.

The breakthrough played an important role in helping to convict Sinclair for the murders. He was later sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 37 years – meaning he would have to live to 106 to even be eligible for parole.

Now considered to be Scotland’s worst serial killer, Sinclair is also believed to have killed at least another six women during his twisted reign of terror.

(Image: Rex Features)

""I’d done my bit to make sure the streets are safer without Sinclair,"" says Lorna. ""I did think to myself, 'Wow! Maybe justice would never have been served if I hadn’t worked so hard in this field of research.'

""The nicest thing that happened was when Helen Scott’s father, Morain, approached me after the verdict to thank me. It was so wonderful, because his wife had died and he’d carried the burden of his daughter’s murder his entire life. I could see his relief at finally getting some sort of closure.""

Remarkably, the World End’s case is just one of dozens of high-profile crimes that Lorna has investigated. The so-called ‘Soil Sleuth’ has helped solve more than 100 cases and put some of the UK’s most notorious killers behind bars, as well as helping to clear many other defendants wrongly accused of crimes.

It’s an achievement that saw her honoured with a Special Recognition award at the Daily Mirror’s prestigious Pride Of Britain ceremony, in partnership with TSB, last week (tune in to see the star-studded event on Tuesday, 8pm, ITV). Lorna admits to feeling humbled that the judges commended her outstanding commitment to seeking justice for victims.

(Image: PA)

""I thought Pride Of Britain was something I couldn’t possibly be worthy of,"" she says. ""When I was first told about my award, I thought it was a colleague winding me up. It was so inspiring to meet the other winners, hear their life stories and learn about the

great things they have all done. I hope my award encourages young girls to think about science as a potential career, because it can be rewarding.""

Certainly, the Aberdeen mother-of-three could never have predicted the direction her career would take when she graduated from Edinburgh University with a degree in geography.

After completing a PhD in soil science, Lorna initially applied her specialist knowledge to projects related to agriculture and the environment. However, in 2003, police asked the professor to help examine a spade found in a suspected drug dealer’s car. She was able to take soil samples and link them to a nearby wood, where a stash of illegal narcotics were found.

(Image: NEWSLINE MEDIA LIMITED)

That made Lorna realise that she could provide a valuable crime-fighting resource as a forensic geologist. She now runs The James Hutton Institute laboratory and collaborates regularly with the National Crime Agency to present evidence in court.

""The forensic work I do is nowhere near as sexy or glamourous as the TV show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation!"" Lorna laughs. ""Very often I’m cold and miserable at a crime scene in the middle of winter, kitted out with a gown, mask, goggles and thick gloves. It can be slow, muddy and painstaking work. But I can cope with conditions like that because I know I’m helping to find justice for a person who has had their life taken away from them.

""That’s one of the things that drives me. Life is so precious and I think we should stop at nothing to try to find justice for victims of murder and serious crimes.""

Family support

It was a point emphasised in a very poignant way when Lorna’s forensic work helped convict depraved cab driver Christopher Halliwell of prostitute Becky Godden’s murder in 2003.

""After I’d given evidence, Becky’s mum Karen gave me a big hug,"" says the professor.""She gave me her thanks and said she didn’t realise just how much work I’d put into the case.

""It really did bring a tear to my eye, because I have young teenage daughters and I could share her pain. It really brought home the human element, as the victims are very often young girls whose lives have been cut short by these horrible murderers""

Despite the disturbing nature of her work, Lorna says she feels lucky to have the support and love of her husband, Robert, and her two kids.

""My family have been so understanding,"" she smiles. ""My job isn’t a 9-to-5 lifestyle. I work a lot of nights and weekends, flying around the world, attending crime scenes and giving evidence in court at the last minute.

""As a little girl I used to scare myself by watching horror films, but I don’t get nightmares as a result of the grim things I’m exposed to in real life. There’s so much more kindness in the world than there is evil. You have to put it into context, as these appalling crimes are actually very rare.""

It was a glorious day in April 2007 and my twin sister Victoria had just given birth to a boy. My mother Elizabeth, 65, was excited to meet the latest addition and, along with my two-year-old daughter Pollyanna, we set out from my house in south London to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, just a few miles away.

We lived 100 yards from a busy bus depot, and planned to take the short ride to Chelsea. Pollyanna, who had recently learnt to walk, toddled beside us, her plump hand clasped in her gran’s fingers. I heard horns blaring and shouting, but we were all in such a state of excitement we thought little of it. I noticed a child’s yellow lunchbox lying on the pavement, and I reached down to pick it up, intending to put it on a nearby wall for the owner to find.

I have tried to block the memories of what happened next from my mind. The memory is too devastating, too tragic. I looked up to see an out-of-control bus hurtling towards us at a ferocious speed. There was no time to scream, it ploughed into us on the pavement. I remember a bang as loud as a bomb, and then I fell to the ground, smacking my head on the wall as I fell.

What happened next is muddled. I drifted in and out of consciousness as I lay in a pool of blood, my legs trapped beneath the bus. But that was nothing: my mother had lost her life in that moment. She must have just slipped away, very quickly.

My little girl, who a moment ago had been holding her Gran-Gran’s hand, was screaming nearby. She’d been flung 20ft through the air, and I could see her leg hanging from her knee by a thread, her thigh swollen as if blown up like a red balloon.

With my legs pinned to the ground, I couldn’t help my daughter and I could only watch as she began to crawl towards me... I’ll carry the guilt of that feeling for the rest of my life.

The aftermath

A kind woman called Annalee raced out of her house and scooped Pollyanna up, clutching her to her chest tightly, desperately trying to hold her right leg together. Later, we realised Annalee may well have saved my little girl’s life by stemming the blood flow.

At some point my husband Christopher arrived, having rushed from his office in central London. He ducked under the police tape and ran over to where I was being stretchered into an ambulance, my head wedged into a bright orange collar to stop it moving.

""Christopher, I think Mummy’s dead, and Pollyanna’s foot has fallen off. A bus hit us,"" I said quietly. ""Go with Pollyanna.""

Our little girl was being taken to Chelsea and Westminster hospital – the place we’d cheerfully set out to less than an hour before – while I was rushed to Charing Cross Hospital.

Surgeons operated on Pollyanna for eight hours, desperately trying to save her leg, but in the end they couldn’t. My own leg was badly damaged: I’d suffered ‘a severe degloving of the leg’, where much of the flesh and muscle below the knee had been completely stripped off.

We found out the bus driver was angry because he couldn’t enter the bus depot. It was road rage, pure and simple. The trial took place more than a year later, and it was nightmarish. Standing in the witness box, recounting what had happened, was so painful that, at one point, I collapsed.

The driver was given four years in prison – the maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving. It’s an appallingly short sentence, but I haven’t allowed myself to get too angry with the driver – it wouldn’t be good for me. I can’t waste my emotions on anger

for him.

Instead, I’ve channelled my energy into changing the system. The bus company treated us like we were insurance statistics, not people whose lives had been irrevocably changed. It was seven years before they apologised, along with Transport for London, after I appealed to Boris Johnson.

Helping others

Eventually, I helped TfL to set up The Sarah Hope Line for victims of life-changing accidents on the transport system. It’s known as the voice of kindness, because it gives people advice and counselling.

The phone line has supported people through all sorts of experiences: after the London Bridge terror attack there were a lot of very traumatised taxi drivers picking up injured people, and after the Parson’s Green bomb many people were too scared to get on a train. I can’t tell you how much the line would have helped me, had it been available: instead of kindness I was up against heartless lawyers and transport executives.

(Image: Daily Mirror)

It was nine years before I could get on a bus again – even now I find them scary. But I’ve been working with TfL as a bus safety campaigner to help improve the conditions their drivers work in.

There’s no excuse for what that bus driver did to us, because it was road rage, but I see now that bus drivers do more than just drive – they have to deal with rude members of the public, and are often exhausted.

A TfL boss told me I’ve changed the way they think, and those words meant a lot to me. If they can change the way they treat their drivers and put safety first, that’s huge.

Pollyanna is now a bright, healthy 12-year-old who loves ballet. It’s not always easy – she’s had countless operations – but we always try to treat her just the same as her siblings, Barnaby, 17, and Sapphire, 14.

She’s had more than 20 prosthetic legs and many of her operations have been life saving. Without a bone-trimming operation, for example, she could have developed an infection and died. I’ve had many operations on my own leg, and it’s still weak and painful.

It led my twin sister Victoria and I to think about how difficult it would be for Pollyanna without the medical care that is vital to life. We found out there are more than 30 million amputees in the world. In many countries, they are not valued enough to be given an education and they can’t do anything apart from beg.

We’ve tried to change everything into a positive experience, so we set up a charity called Elizabeth’s Legacy of Hope, in memory of my mother and inspired by Pollyanna’s smiling face. We’ve raised more than £600,000 to buy prosthetic legs for child amputees in countries like India and Sierra Leone. But the charity is in need of help and support.

Winning a Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award is lovely… I don’t think of the things I’ve done as extraordinary. I’ve been put on a journey: I’ve learnt there are many injustices in the world I can help with. I couldn’t have done anything without my sister and husband. This award is for them as much as it’s for me, and for my mum. We’ll share it.

Shellshocked Brent ­Amerman checked into rehab and knew his crazy days of wild partying with socialite pal Lady Victoria Hervey were over.

He had hit a wall after three years of mixing with Hollywood A-listers – and blowing a fortune on drugs.

There were blurred memories of a night at Mickey Rourke’s, ­Victoria’s threesome with singer Mel B and estranged husband Stephen Belafonte , meetings with countless stars – and the demise of a pet dog named Zulu who ended up in a freezer.

Brent decided it was time to get out... before the lifestyle killed him.

Now, as the 34-year-old looks back at photos of him and the former British “It Girl”, he shudders at what might have been.

And he tells the Sunday Mirror how their friendship turned sour after, he claims, they fell out over a joint business venture.

Brent, who lived with Victoria in the Hollywood Hills, said: “Victoria and I were friends for three years – I thought we were friends. But I feel she was using me.

(Image: Getty Images North America)

“Looking back I sometimes miss all the glitz and the glamour. They were crazy times.

“Then I think about the bad side. I wouldn’t be alive any more if I had carried on.”

Brent met the 41-year-old daughter of the Marquess of Bristol after she moved to Tinseltown from London to try acting.

She failed at that but became a reality TV regular – and is currently on ITV2’s Celebrity Showmance.

Fashion-loving Brent and Victoria became best friends after living in the same apartment block in the Hollywood Hills in 2005.

Brent, who is gay and now happily married, said: “She seemed nice and good fun.

“We started hanging out and then I stayed in her flat to look after her dogs when she went on Celebrity Love Island in Fiji.

“I wasn’t working. My parents, who lived in Texas, were wealthy and were supporting me.

“I was having an incredible time going to Oscar parties, Emmy parties – and I had so much fun meeting real stars.”

(Image: Sunday Mirror)

His Facebook pages are awash with pictures of the pair alongside the likes of Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush, Gerard Butler, Ioan Gruffudd and Rourke.

Brent added: “We would be going to parties three or four times a week and I would buy a few hundred dollars of drugs a couple of times a week.

“She never took any money out. She had an attitude that she deserved everything and didn’t need to pay for it. She said she was training me to do the same.”

There is no suggestion Victoria took the drugs Brent bought.

He said: “She was always using her posh English accent to get her way. To be fair, whenever older men would buy her drinks, she would always make them get me one too.

“I was enthralled with her. I was swept away by the parties and ­lifestyle she introduced me to.”

But often the pair would party to excess.

He recalled: “I remember having to carry her to bed quite a few times. When she came back from a Burning Man festival she was completed wasted.

“I also saved her one night. We were at a party and she was drunk walking on the cover of a swimming pool when it started to collapse. Luckily, I was able to drag her out.”

(Image: Sunday Mirror)

Another time, Brent ended up chaperoning her back to Mickey Rourke’s.

He said: “I know Mickey didn’t want me along for the ride, but I ended up in his minder’s car.

“He was hammering through the Hollywood Hills for ages before we got there – to a house full of dogs.

“I remember waking up the next morning in Mickey Rourke’s house without any shoes on. Other parties in Beverly Hills stick in my mind. At an art dealer’s house I remember doing cocaine in this room – mirrors everywhere. I’m sure that there must have been cameras.”

(Image: Getty Images North America)

Brent told how, in 2007, he picked Victoria up from the home of former Spice Girl Mel B and Stephen ­Belafonte, both 42.

It was revealed in April that she had a drunken threesome with the couple – who are now locked in a divorce battle.

Things started to turn sour between him and Victoria when, Brent claims, their plans to open a vintage clothing business together hit the skids.

He went on: “I’m a trusting person and try to see the best in people. But little things started to happen.”

Brent said that he and Victoria had decided to work together selling vintage designer frocks that he had collected over the years.

They were going to call their shop the Lady and the Lion – after Brent’s long hair at the time and Victoria’s love of the Narnia stories. But it never opened because Brent’s parents stepped in and forced him to go into rehab because of his drinking.

He revealed: “The partying had become too much for me. That’s why my parents made me go to rehab.

“It’s also why our business never got off the ground. Victoria blamed me for that.”

Brent said there was a big falling out over what should happen to the stock of dresses they had planned to sell.

“My parents were too concerned with my recovery,” he added. “But I will never forgive her for the way she treated me and them.”

Brent, who now runs clothing website Brent Edward Vintage, also claims ­Victoria’s pet Zulu, a Norfolk terrier, died after being left with a dog sitter.

He added: “The sitter called me saying Zulu was in the freezer because he hadn’t been able to get hold of Victoria for weeks.”

Victoria will be seen alongside former Tottenham soccer star Jamie O’Hara, 31, on ITV2 on Wednesday in the final episode of Celebrity Showmance – in which six single celebrities hook up.

Victoria, who has always denied taking drugs, last night told the Sunday Mirror that Brent was “a friend I knew briefly 10 years ago” and described his claims about her as “absolute nonsense”."

Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have travelled to Bulgaria to trace a 'critical witness' missing from Portugal, it emerged last night.

Officers believe the woman, who is described as wearing purple, could hold the key to discovering what happened to the missing little girl.

The witness, who is the widow of a paedophile, reportedly lived near the McCann's holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Portual, where the three-year-old vanished from in May 2007.

The woman and her husband vanished from the Algarve after Madeleine's disappearance, according to The Sun.

Police have been unable to trace the woman despite extensive searches, it was reported.

A source told the newspaper: “There is no evidence they were involved but it would be good to eliminate them from the investigation.”

Operation Grange, Scotland Yard's Maddie investigation, has already cost nearly £12million but was last month handed an extra £154,000 to trace the witness.

Maddie's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, said they were 'very grateful' for an £85,000 cash injection from the Home Office in March this year to officers could trace 'critical' new leads.

Officers have investigated some 60 people in relation to the case since Operation Grange was launched in 2011.

A source told the Sun: ""She may have seen or heard something which to her may seem insignificant but to us could prove vital.

""If she recognises herself she should contact police. She has nothing to fear. This is just to eliminate her from enquiries.""

A source close to Operation Grange added that the woman could be a ""critical line of inquiry"".

There are many theories about what happened to missing Madeleine and police believe it is possible the little girl was taken during a burglary ""gone wrong"".

(Image: PA)

In March Scotland Yard chief Mark Rowley said there were still ""critical"" leads of ""great interest"" in the case.

He ruled out that Madeleine's parents, from Rothley, Leics, were involved in her abduction and said she could still be alive.

As the couple faced the agonising 10th anniversary of their daughter's disappearance, Rowley said: ""I know we have a significant line of inquiry which is worth pursuing, and because it's worth pursuing it could provide an answer, but until we've gone through it I won't know whether we are going to get there or not.""

Officers have investigated 60 people of interest and 560 lines of enquiry. The team, led by Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, insisted there was “still important work to do and focused lines of investigation”."

A paedophile performed a sex act in front of three young boys who were playing in the street and told them ‘don’t grass, it’s not illegal’.

Perverted Gary O’Brien targeted the youngsters, who were all aged under 10, in an alleyway in Salford, Manchester Crown Court heard.

One of the little boys raised the alarm to a passerby and the man tracked down O’Brien, grabbing him and detaining him until the police arrived.

O’Brien, 45, who appeared to smirk during the hearing via video link from prison, has now been give a 20-month sentence, the Manchester Evening News reported.

The boys’ mothers have told how the youngsters were initially too scared to go and play out again following the ordeal.

Prosecuting, Duncan Wilcock told how the victims were approached by O’Brien on June 15 in an alleyway.

He told one boy: “Don’t be afraid. Watch me.”

He told another boy: “Don’t be scared. Don’t grass, it’s not illegal.”

One of the boys left the alleyway and told a man nearby what had happened.

The Good Samaritan found O’Brien standing in some bushes with his back to a wall.

Mr Wilcock said he ‘took hold’ of O’Brien and detained him until police arrived.

In a victim impact statement, one mother said she was ‘worried sick’ following the incident.

She said: “I don’t like my son being outside on his own as I am terrified something terrible might happen to him.”

Another said it was about five weeks before their son was able to go back outside and play with his friends again.

O’Brien, who has a previous conviction for indecently assaulting a boy, declined to answer questions after being arrested.

Defending, Stuart Neill said O’Brien has mental health issues and was battling alcoholism.

He said O’Brien has been kicked out of a programme supporting single homeless people cause of his drink problems, and said he has ‘nowhere to go’.

But the judge, Recorder Andrew Long, said: “Your alcoholism is no excuse whatsoever for committing this crime.”

O’Brien, of Barton Lane, Eccles, pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in sexual activity with a child."

In Thor: Ragnarok, the Asgardian Avenger — also known as the God of Thunder, the Prince of Asgard, and the self-proclaimed ""Strongest Avenger"" — is really put through the ringer. He's stripped of his beloved Mjölnir (and his luxurious locks), kicked out of his home by the evil Hela, and stuck on a literal trash planet. On the bright side, he's a space gladiator now, which I guess is kinda cool. (Mild spoilers lie ahead.)

With acclaimed indie director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) at the helm, Ragnarok is far more colorful and wildly irreverent than its predecessors. Not to mention, for his third solo theatrical outing as the mighty Thor, Chris Hemsworth is better than ever. Anyone who has seen Hemsworth's improvisational skills at work in 2016's Ghostbusters knows that the Aussie is unfairly funny, and Waititi — known for his own absurdist humor — really tapped into his star's comedic side. The result? Marvel Studios' funniest movie by a mile. Or, in this case, a light year. (There's legit a joke about the size of The Hulk's dick.)

If that doesn't immediately sell you on this movie, here are seven reasons you definitely don't want to miss Thor: Ragnarok:"

Taylor Swift is moving on with the help of someone special. In ""Call It What You Want,"" our latest taste of Reputation, Tay is singing about a boy who loves her like she's ""brand new."" The crown was taken from her, she sings in the first verse, but she's better off without it. Why? She's got a baby who's ""high above the whole scene"" and who ""[builds] fires to keep [her] warm.""

Tay is clearly swooning over this lucky guy, just as she did in her last song, ""Gorgeous."" Though she'll never name names, fan believe she's singing about her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.

""I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers / Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right / Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night,"" Tay gushes in the second verse. Does anyone else feel like a third wheel while listening to this song or is that just me?

Swifties quickly connected Alwyn to these lyrics in particular: ""I want to wear his initial / On a chain round my neck, chain round my neck / Not because he owns me / But 'cause he really knows me.""

Tay's been spotted wearing a necklace that matches this description. (The paper airplane necklace she referenced in 1989 reportedly belongs to Harry Styles.)

I know, this is a lot of jewelry to keep track of. When Reputation finally arrives November 10, I think it's safe to say we'll have many more easter eggs to unpack.

""Love is always going to be a huge theme in what I write about, just because there are no two similar relationships,"" Swift told MTV News in January 2012, nine months before Red came out. ""There are no two times that you feel love the same way, or hurt the same way, or rejection the same way, or frustration. It's all different, and I'm fascinated by that, as is kind of shown throughout my albums."""

Everything we know so far, from the tour to the potential features

It’s November, which means Taylor Swift season is finally in full swing. Are you ready for it?

The now-enigmatic pop star’s sixth album, Reputation, slithers its way into the world on November 10, more than three years after 1989. It's her longest gap between albums, and the world is wondering: What has she been up to all this time, besides cunningly dodging paparazzi and not doing interviews? It’s hard to tell — Reputation is one of the winter’s most fiercely guarded secrets... and therefore one of the most hotly anticipated ones.

Ahead of its release, here’s everything we know about Reputation so far, from the music to the tour to the potential features."

Sweet and deeply personal, Kehlani’s “Honey” is a candid love song about the singer’s relationship with a woman. Over the light strumming of a guitar Kehlani confidently sings, “All the pretty girls in the world, but I’m in this space with you.” In an interview with MTV News correspondent Gaby Wilson at Camp Flog Gnaw, Kehlani opened up about the origins of the song and its importance to her.

“I am very openly queer,” says the California songwriter. “I thought that my music lacked representation of how my actual life is. I thought it was important to be myself fluidly in my music and not just in my life. My art mimics my life, so you know I have a girlfriend, and it’s only right that that’s what I make music about and that I’m able to put that out confidently.”

It's fitting Kehlani opened up about “Honey,” at Tyler, the Creator’s annual music festival. The release of Tyler’s Flower Boy, saw the rapper with a history of misogynistic and homophobic lyrics similarly using the metaphor of nature and bees to detail a sexual awakening. As a whole, 2017 is a banner year for artists embracing their sexuality. Taylor Bennett, iLoveMakonnen, and Lil Peep have all come forth revealing their sexual fluidity in different ways.

With “Honey,” Kehlani takes control of her narrative. As her soft and lilting voice slyly sings, “I’m a beautiful wreck, a colorful mess,” it is instantly relatable. For a moment, Kehlani gives fans an intimate look into her life when she didn’t have to."

Tyrese's Feud With The Rock Just Escalated To The Point Of No Return

Tyrese Gibson's feud with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has finally escalated to the point of no return. On Wednesday (November 1), the actor issued an ultimatum to the Fast & Furious producers: It's either him or The Rock. Wait. What.

""Hello world... hello loyal fans and loved ones from OUR fast universe,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""I'm sorry to announce that if Dewayne is in Fast9 there will no more Roman Peirce [sic]. You mess with family and my daughters survival I mess with yours... close your eyes dude you're a 'Clown.'""

What is even happening?

It all started with the formal announcement of Johnson's Fast spin-off, which will focus on fan-favorite character Luke Hobbs and Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw. In doing so, Universal Pictures pushed Fast 9 back a year to April 2020 to accommodate for the Hobbs-centric film. Last month, Gibson, who's been part of the franchise since 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious, lashed out at his Fast costar Johnson for holding up production on the ninth installment of the popular franchise — and, most importantly, delaying his Fast 9 payday. (Gibson is currently in the middle of a heated custody battle with his ex-wife, Norma Mitchell Gibson.)

Problems between the two Fast stars first emerged in September when Gibson publicly pleaded with his costar on social media to not move forward with the then-rumored spin-off. For his part, Johnson has yet to publicly respond to any of this.

Now, it looks like Gibson is taking this relatively one-sided feud to the next level by threatening to leave the franchise. It's only a matter of time before producer-star Vin Diesel involves himself in this mess — again."

If you were forced to spend all day every day with Zac Efron would you fall in love? Duh.

CHECK OUT THESE CELEBS WHO DARED TO DATE A CIVILIAN...

But these celebs have kind of made a habit of dating their co-stars because who can be bothered meeting new people or going on Tinder?

1. Leighton Meester

Blair Waldorf’s man of choice was always rich dudes and Leighton’s seems to be her co-stars. She dated Sebastian Stan, who played Carter Baizen in GG, for two years after moving on from her Remember The Daze co-star Aaron Himelstein. But now she’s married to Adam Brody who she appeared in The Oranges with in 2011.

2. Chloe Ferry

Since entering the Geordie Shore house in 2011, Chloe made a beeline for Scotty T which ended with her broken heart. After Scott, she began her on/off relationship with Marty McKenna when he entered the house in 2015. During her off period with Marty, she hooked up with Geordie newbie Sam Bentham before heading back to Marty. It’s never-ending tbh.

3. Jennifer Garner

While starring in teen show Felicity in 1998, Jen fell for her co-star Scott Foley AKA Jake in Scandal. FIT. The pair married but got divorced in 2003 and she quickly moved onto Michael Vartan who she was starring with in Alias, amid rumours of an affair. While she was dating him she met Ben Affleck when the two starred together in Daredevil in 2003 and later (after she’d split with Michael) got hitched in 2005. The pair divorced in 2017 and sources admitted she was spending a lot of time with Michael again. Messy.

4. Rachel McAdams

Even though it started out with fighting and hate, Rachel and Ryan Gosling fell in love on the set of The Notebook (because how could you not?). After four years, the pair went their separate ways in 2010 she met co-star Michael Sheen while filming Midnight In Paris. After splitting from Michael after a three years relationship, she met Taylor Kitsch in 2015 on the set of True Detective and they dated for a year. Phew.

5. Emily VanCamp

After Emily’s big break in Everwood, she also nabbed herself a boyfriend in the shape of Chris Pratt who she dated for two years before going their separate ways in 2006. After she went onto star in Brothers and Sisters she dated her onscreen boyf Dave Annable for a year before splitting. In 2010 she fell for her Ben Hur co-star The Original’s Joseph Moran before hitting it big in Revenge, where she met her soon-to-be husband co-star Josh Bowman.

6. Sophia Bush

Sophia is the queen of our lives for her One Tree Hill dating history if we’re honest. Not only did she get married to Chad Michael Murray in 2006 before getting divorced, amid rumours of him cheating with Paris Hilton, but she moved on with the other Scott brother; James Lafferty, in 2008. The year after, she fell for Austin Nichols after he started on the show as Brooke’s husband Julian. DREAM.

7. Lauren Pope

Ah remember the his and her’s nose jobs during the days of Lauren’s romance with Kirk Norcross in 2010? Good times. After Kirk, she moved onto Mario Falcone in 2013 before he hooked up with Chloe Sims causing some major beef between the BFFs. Quickly following her romance with Mario she dated Tom Pearce for a couple of months before falling for Lewis Bloor in 2014. But we all saw his horrific dumping when he called her ‘old’ and Popey is currently dating Jon Clark whilst filming the current series of TOWIE. Fingers crossed.

8. Jessica Wright

After dating Ricky Rayment for two years from 2012, the pair just couldn’t get over his infidelity and Jess moved onto have a brief relationship with Pete Wicks (pre-Megan McKenna obvs) in 2015. Things got a bit messy when she snogged Lewis Bloor during that time and things fizzled out after she realised she didn’t really want another boyfriend yet.

9. Marnie Simpson

BACKGRID

Marns came into our lives, moving into the Geordie Shore house in 2013 as a potential thang for Gaz Beadle. After the pair hooked up, drama ensued and she began a complicated will they won’t/they with Scotty T before her major on/off saga with Aaron Chalmers when he entered the house in 2014. In 2017 Marnie starred in Single AF, where she met Casey Johnson and the pair have been posting loved-up selfies ever since. Cuuute.

10. Ryan Gosling

Tbh we are still shipping Sandra Bullock and Ryan who dated on the set of Murder By Numbers in 2001 but we feel that ship has probs sailed. He went onto date Rachel McAdams while filming The Notebook for four years in 2004 before meeting Eva Mendes in 2011 on the set of The Place Beyond The Pines and the rest was history. The couple now have a child together and are the cutest pair ever.

11. Steph Pratt

During her time on The Hills Steph always had a potential man in tow. She first hooked up with Doug Reinhart, who had JUST dated Lauren Conrad, and it ended in tears and denial on his part that anything had happened. Erm you’re on camera bud. Off she popped to Made In Chelsea after The Hills waved goodbye and met Spencer Matthews, who inevitably cheated on her, before moving onto Josh Shepherd who she dated for two years. After they split, she met TOWIE’s Joey Essex after they starred on Celebs Go Dating together and enjoyed a forbidden romance in 2016.

12. Alex Pettyfer

During the filming of Wild Child in 2008, Alex fell for Emma Roberts but the relationship was short-lived after fights and bust-ups. In 2010 he moved on with co-star Dianna Agron whilst filming I Am Number Four but once again, sources said the pair were constantly fighting, with Alex accusing her of cheating on him with Sebastian Stan. Then in 2011, during the filming of Magic Mike (best movie ever), he hooked up with Riley Keough who was starring in the film. They dated for two tears before splitting in 2013.

13. Taylor Lautner

We all remember the Taylor squared relationship after Taylor and Taylor Swift only had eyes for each other on the set of Valentine’s Day. The relationship was over before we knew it and the following year he met Lily Collins during filming for Abduction. After splitting in 2011 he then fell for Marie Avgeropoulos on the set of Tracers and the pair dated for a year.

14. Marty McKenna

MTV

We’re pretty sure Marty views the Geordie Shore house as his very own personal dating pool tbh. After appearing on our screens for the first time he struck up a romance with Chloe Ferry. But that didn’t mean he wasn’t going to see other people. During his time on the show he has also hooked up with fellow Geordies; Sarah Goodhart, Elettra Lamborghini, Eve Shannon and Charlotte Crosby. Yikes.

The 27-year-old came forward with the experience in a speech at Elle's Women In Hollywood Event on Monday night, where she went into detail for the first time about the incident.

Let's all get checking out an update from MTV News...

Taking to the lectern to comment on her mistreatment in the industry, Jen began: ""When I was much younger and starting out, I was told by producers of a film to lose 15 pounds in two weeks,”

“One girl before me had already been fired for not losing the weight fast enough,” she added. “During this time a female producer had me do a nude lineup with about five women who were much, much, thinner than me. We all stood side by side with only tape on covering our privates.”

Jennifer went on to describe the moment as a ""degrading and humiliating"" experience, made worse by the fact the producer suggested she use the naked photos of herself as ""inspiration"" to lose weight.

After raising her concerns to another producer on the movie, Jennifer said that his reply was less than helpful: ""He said he didn't know why everyone thought I was so fat, he thought I was 'perfectly f--kable.""

While it's easy for outsiders looking in on the situation to say that she should have walked out the door, Jen pointed out that she feared her career was on the line.

“I’m still learning that I don’t have to smile when a man makes me uncomfortable,” she said. “Every human being should have the power to be treated with respect because they’re human.”

This all comes after Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has been accused of multiple counts of sexual assault.

Jennifer, who worked with Weinstein on Silver Linings Playbook, told People Magazine that she was ""deeply disturbed"" to hear the news, but hadn't experienced any harassment herself.

“I worked with Harvey five years ago and I did not experience any form of harassment personally, nor did I know about any of these allegations. This kind of abuse is inexcusable and absolutely upsetting.”

She continued: “My heart goes out to all of the women affected by these gross actions. And I want to thank them for their bravery to come forward.”"

The evidence is now crystal clear that climate change is real, caused by humans, happening faster than predicted, and poses a tremendous threat to the United States and the rest of the world, according to the Climate Science Special Report released Friday.

This 470-page U.S. government report evaluated the latest scientific evidence and concludes that storms, including hurricanes, have become more powerful; heavy rainfall is more common in some parts of the U.S.; and heat waves, wildfires, and droughts are more intense and happening more frequently.

These conclusions were made with an unprecedented level of scientific certainty, utterly refuting statements made by senior Trump administration officials about the causes and effects of our changing climate. (See more on the Trump administration’s approach to climate.)

Climate 101: Causes and Effects The climate is certainly changing. But what is causing this change? And how does the rising temperature affect the environment, and our lives?

The White House downplayed the new report on Friday. “The climate has changed and is always changing,” White House spokesperson Raj Shah said in a statement.

In contrast, the report pins today’s climate change squarely on human activities and says there is “no convincing alternative explanation” supported by science to explain the warming seen in the last century. (See a ""Running List of How Trump Is Changing the Environment."")

“This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization,” says Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University, one of the report’s lead authors.

“We’ve known for decades that human activities are warming the planet and that this is potentially very dangerous,” Hayhoe says. Burning fossil fuels and deforestation are two of the main human activities causing global warming—by putting billions of tons of carbon dioxide, or CO 2 , into the atmosphere every year. (See ""Global Warming 101"" below for more.)

“Almost every year we’re learning that the impacts of climate change are coming faster and are worse than expected,” she says.

The Climate Science Special Report, or CSSR, is part of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, which will be completed in 2018. The CSSR is Congressionally mandated and designed to be the authoritative assessment of the science of climate change, with a focus on the United States.

""The CSSR is extremely thorough and well-written,"" says Kevin Trenberth, an atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. It uses the most current scientific evidence to reveal the human fingerprints on the drivers of extreme weather events, such as heavier rainfall and increases in heatwaves and wildfires, Trenberth adds. Trenberth was an official National Academy of Science reviewer of a draft version of the CSSR.

In looking at the latest science on the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, the report concludes that sea levels could rise globally by as much as eight feet by the year 2100. Sea level rise does not happen evenly, and the coasts of the U.S. Northeast and the western Gulf of Mexico are likely to experience much higher levels than the global average. A 10-foot sea level rise would put the New York City subway system and parts of the city permanently underwater, another study found. (See “Sea Level Rise Will Flood Hundreds of Cities in the Near Future.”)

The CSSR employs a “balance of evidence” approach and inherently is scientifically conservative in its conclusions, says Hayhoe.

Climate 101: Oceans



Select footage courtesy NASA Oceans serve as the planet’s largest habitat and also help to regulate the global climate. But why is the ocean salty? And how is climate change impacting the ocean? Find out more about the ocean, including the consequences of and potential solutions to these changes.

One example of this cautious approach: Some scientists believe that the Atlantic Ocean’s “conveyor belt” current, which carries warm water from the Caribbean northward toward the British Isles and northern Europe, is already slowing down due to the influx of cold, fresh water from the melting of the ice sheet in Greenland.

The report concludes, however, that there isn’t enough evidence yet of such a slowdown, largely because there hasn’t been enough research. Should this current slow, it would have “dramatic climate feedbacks as the ocean absorbs less heat and CO 2 from the atmosphere … [and] affect the climates of North America and Europe.”

The report documents a dozen other potential “dramatic climate feedbacks” including the complete loss of Arctic ice in the summer, the thawing of Earth’s permafrost zone, and the loss of the Greenland ice sheet. These tipping points, or more accurately ""tipping elements,"" are major aspects of the climate system that could ‘tip’ into a new state with far-ranging consequences for the climate, says Hayhoe.

Climate models that provide a window into the future largely do not include these tipping elements. Moreover, these are unlikely to occur in isolation and may act more like dominoes, one triggering another. In fact, the CSSR notes that “compound extreme events” such as hot and dry conditions can trigger heat waves, drought, and wildfires, resulting in economic and social impacts that can be greater than the sum of the parts.

“My biggest worry is cascading consequences of these events,” Hayhoe says.

Trenberth agrees, saying things usually happen on top of each other and often with unexpected results. This is why “economists have greatly underestimated the impacts of climate change,” he says."

From dogs that demonstrate decidedly odd tastes in treats to cats that think outside the litter box, pets can exhibit some seriously strange behavior. This week, we asked the pros to field questions from readers wondering about their pets’ peculiar habits.

The Scoop on Poop Eating

Many animals consume feces, a most locally sourced meal that may contain intact food particles—and thus nutrition.

To the horror of dog owners, this fondness for feces sometimes applies to their pets. (Why Do Animals—Including Your Dog—Eat Poop?)

It “may be an evolutionary legacy of the dog’s long history of scavenging for a living,” says James Serpell, a professor of animal ethics and welfare at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, via email.

Reader Susan Moynihan just wants to know, “How can I get my dog to stop [eating poop]?”

A precautionary vet visit is step one, says Serpell, who also wrote the book, The Domestic Dog: Its Evolution, Behavior and Interactions with People. Owners should rule out pancreatic enzyme deficiency and make sure the dog is eating properly, he says.

If all is well, reward-based training should help. Gently but firmly discourage the behavior while leash-walking, and give the dog treats and praise when he ignores scat, Serpell advises.

If the poop-eating behavior persists, he says, “a distasteful substance such as monosodium glutamate can be added to feces to discourage the behavior.”

Paper Tiger

Reader Ann Buckley’s one-year-old cat has the less revolting oral habit of licking the ink on freshly printed pieces of paper and asks, “Is it dangerous?”

“Home/office printers use water, ethylene glycol, and alcohol, but would likely only be toxic if the pet was licking the printer cartridge directly,” says Pamela Martin, an assistant professor for small animal medicine at Tuskegee University.

If it doesn’t happen daily and the cat isn’t eating the paper, it “probably wouldn’t get a toxic dose,” she says, adding that it’s best to just simply keep the papers away from the animal.

Peeing Outside the Box

Reader Kamran Adibi’s problem is one of location.

Adibi’s cat never had any bad behavior “until we moved to another state,” he says. “Since then he always urinates in a specific room on the carpet.”

“Ah, the moving dynamic,” Martin says. Changes like a new partner, baby, or home can trigger stress that manifests as inappropriate urination.

“It sounds like this kitty has a condition called Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC),” an inflammation of the bladder with unknown cause, Martin says.

A vet visit to rule out a urinary tract infection is the first step. If the cat is fine, try reducing simple stressors. For example, avoid covered litter boxes because “cats want to see if anyone is coming” so they can defend themselves, and make sure the box is in a quiet, private spot.

Having enough litter boxes in the house is a big help too.

“We use the rule of N + 1 litter boxes, number of cats in the household plus one,” says Martin. If the home is multi-story, make sure there is a litter box on each floor.

Owners can also reduce their cat’s stress by making sure it has plenty of perches to escape to.

Pheromone therapy and prescription diets can help as well. Martin recommends canned food for FIC because its high water content can benefit “cats that may form sediment or stones in the bladder.”

A kitty drinking fountain (less expensive than it sounds) can help cats stay hydrated.

John Bradshaw, an expert in cat behavior at the U.K.’s University of Bristol, says the ink-licking cat may be reacting to a new, unfamiliar odor, perhaps from the previous homeowner’s cat.

Restricting the cat to one or two rooms in the house, “extending its access gradually, and only after the owner has transferred its scent to all the other rooms,” may help, Bradshaw says.

If the issue is a new boyfriend or girlfriend, though, Martin jokes, “your cat may be trying to tell you something about him or her.”"

When National Geographic caught up with Isaacson by phone at his home in Washington, D.C., he explained why Mona Lisa’s smile is the culmination of a lifetime of inquiry; how Michelangelo and Leonardo couldn’t stand each other; and why being curious was Leonardo’s defining trait.

View Images Courtesy Simon & Schuster

We have to start with the most famous smile in the world. Where does the “Mona Lisa” fit into Leonardo’s life and work—and how has she managed to bewitch us for 500 years?

The Mona Lisa’s smile is the culmination of a lifetime spent studying art, science, optics, and every other possible field that he could apply his curiosity to, including understanding the universe and how we fit into it.

Leonardo spent many pages in his notebook dissecting the human face to figure out every muscle and nerve that touched the lips. On one of those pages you see a faint sketch at the top of the beginning of the smile of the Mona Lisa. Leonardo kept that painting from 1503, when he started it, to his deathbed in 1519, trying to get every aspect exactly right in layer after layer. During that period, he dissected the human eye on cadavers and was able to understand that the center of the retina sees detail, but the edges see shadows and shapes better. If you look directly at the Mona Lisa smile, the corners of the lips turn downward slightly, but shadows and light make it seem like it’s turning upwards. As you move your eyes across her face the smile flickers on and off.

He carried his notebook around as he walked through Florence or Milan, and always sketched people’s expressions and emotions and tried to relate that to the inner feelings they were having. You see that most obviously in “The Last Supper.”

But the “Mona Lisa” is the culmination because the emotions that she’s expressing, just like her smile, are a bit elusive. Every time you look at her it seems slightly different. Unlike other portraits of the time, this is not just a flat, surface depiction. It tries to depict the inner emotions.

His other most famous masterpiece is “The Last Supper,” which you call “the most spell-binding narrative painting in history.” Take us inside its creation—and explain why it is such a supreme work of art.

The Duke of Milan asked him to paint it on the wall of a dining hall of a monastery. Unlike other depictions of “The Last Supper,” of which there were hundreds at the time, Leonardo doesn’t just capture a moment. He understands that there is no such thing as a disconnected instant of time. He writes that any instant has what’s come before it and after it embodied into it, because it’s in motion.

So he makes “The Last Supper” a dramatic narrative. As you walk in the door, you see Christ’s hand then, going up the arm, you stare at his face. He’s saying, “One of you shall betray me.” As your eyes move across the picture, you see that sound almost rippling outward as each of the groups of apostles reacts.

Those nearest to him are already saying, “Is it me, Lord?” The ones further away have just started to hear it. As the drama ripples from the center to the edges, it seems to bounce back, as Christ reaches for the bread and wine, the beginning of what will be the institution of the Eucharist.

Despite these achievements, in his own day Leonardo wasn’t primarily known as a painter, was he, but as an architect—and even what we would today call a special effects guy. Unbraid these different strands of his life.

He was mainly, despite what he sometimes wished, a painter. He liked to think of himself as an engineer and architect, which he also did with great passion. But his first job was as a theatrical producer.

From that he learned how to do tricks with perspective because the stage in a theatre recedes faster and looks deeper than it is. Even a table onstage would be tilted slightly so you can see it, which is also what we see in “The Last Supper.” Likewise, on the stage, the theatrical gestures of the characters would be exaggerated, which is what you also see in “The Last Supper.”

His theatrical production led him to mechanical props, like flying machines and a helicopter screw, which were designed to bring angels down from the rafters in some of the performances. Leonardo then blurred the line between fantasy and reality when he went on to try to create real flying machines that were engineering marvels! So, what he picked up in the theatre he brought both to his art and real-life engineering.

What about Leonardo, the man? He was a vegetarian and openly gay, in an age when sodomy was a crime, and quite a dandy. Unpack these different aspects of his character.

He was gay, illegitimate, left handed, a bit of a heretic, but the good thing about Florence was that it was a very tolerant city in the 1470s. Leonardo would go around town wearing short, purple and pink outfits that were somewhat surprising to the people of Florence, but he was very popular. He had an enormous number of friends both in Florence and Milan. He records many dinners with close friends, who were a diverse group: mathematicians, architects, playwrights, engineers, and poets. That diversity helped shape him.

Finally, he was a very good-looking guy. If you look at “Vitruvian Man,” the guy standing nude in the circle and square, that’s largely a self-portrait of Leonardo with his flowing curls and well-proportioned body.

There was a well-known, and mutual, dislike between Leonardo and Michelangelo. Explain the animosity—and set the scene for what became a kind of painterly “high noon” between them.

Leonardo and Michelangelo were very different. Leonardo was popular, sociable, and comfortable with all his eccentricities, including being gay. Michelangelo was also gay but deeply felt the agony and the ecstasy of his identity. He also was very much of a recluse. He had no very close friends, wore dark clothes, so they were polar opposites in look, style, and personality.

They were also very different in their art styles. Michelangelo painted as if he were a sculptor, using very sharp lines. Leonardo believed in sfumato, the blurring of lines, because he felt that was the way we actually see reality.

The rulers of Florence created a competition for both of them to paint battle scenes in the Council Hall. By that point, the rivalry had become bad.

Leonardo had voted to have Michelangelo’s statue of David hidden away in some arcade rather than placed in the middle of the plaza. Michelangelo had been publicly rude to Leonardo. All of this had caused a certain electricity, so the rulers of Florence pitted them against each other to do these two battle drawings.

In the end they both flinched, quitting before they finished the paintings. Then Leonardo moved back to Milan and Michelangelo moved to Rome to work on the Sistine Chapel.

Leonardo never signed his paintings, which has sometimes caused confusion. Tell us the amazing story of “La Bella Principessa”—and the Sherlock Holmes-type investigation to establish its authenticity.

“La Bella Principessa” is a chalk drawing that turned up at auction a few decades ago. It was never thought to be a Leonardo, and sold very inexpensively because they thought it was a German copy of a Florentine artist.

But one art collector was convinced that it was an authentic Leonardo. He bought it and took it around the world to experts to determine whether it truly was a Leonardo. It was pretty much confirmed when they found fingerprints because Leonardo often smudged his work using his thumb.

Then it turned out that the guy who made that claim was a bit unreliable and perhaps even fraudulent so the claim was withdrawn. Finally, with the help of Martin Kemp, the great Oxford Leonardo scholar, they discovered that it was a drawing made by Leonardo, which had been the front piece of a book that was in a library in Poland where somebody had cut it out.

More recently, we have the tale of Salvator Mundi, a beautiful painting that goes on sale November 15th at Christies. For a long time, we also thought this was a copy but in the past ten years it’s been authenticated. It was sold a decade ago for about $100. In November, it’ll probably go for more than $100 million.

It’ll be a major event because it’s the only Leonardo painting in private hands. Nobody will probably ever be able to buy a Leonardo painting again.

One of the natural elements that most fascinated Leonardo, and to which he returned at the end of his life, was water. What did he see in it?

He was a self-taught kid. He didn’t go to school because he was born out of wedlock and among the things he loved was the flow of the streams that went into the Arno River. He studied those, and from his childhood to his deathbed, he was still drawing the spiral forms and trying to figure out the math behind them.

That translates both into a science and his art. He loved how air currents formed little flurries when they went over the curved wings of birds and realized that they helped keep the bird aloft, something we now know about airplanes.

In any of his masterworks, including the “Mona Lisa,” you see a winding river, as though it connects to the blood veins of the person in the portrait, like a connection of the human to the earth.

What do you think is the defining trait of Leonardo’s genius? And what can he teach us?

In the last chapter, I try to answer that with 25 lessons from Leonardo, that also distill lessons from previous books I’ve written on Steve Jobs or Albert Einstein. In all those books, I’ve noticed that creativity comes from connecting art to science. To be really creative, you have to be interested in all sorts of different disciplines rather than be a specialist.

The ultimate example of that is Leonardo da Vinci, who is interested in everything that could possibly be known about the universe, including how we fit into it. That made him a joyous character to write about.

In his notebooks, we see such questions as, describe the tongue of the woodpecker. Why do people yawn? Why is the sky blue? He is passionately curious about everyday phenomenon that most of us quit questioning once we get out of our wonder years and become a bit jaded.

Being curious about everything and curious just for curiosity’s sake, not simply because it’s useful, is the defining trait of Leonardo. It’s how he pushed himself and taught himself to be a genius. We’ll never emulate Einstein’s mathematical ability. But we can all try to learn from, and copy, Leonardo’s curiosity.

As many as 300 to 400 dead sea turtles were found off the coast of El Salvador in Jiquilisco Bay late last month.

Locals began to spot the decomposing sea turtle carcasses as early as October 28, but the massive die off wasn't made public until El Salvador's ministry of environment and natural resources announced the event on Twitter Thursday and provided local reporters with information.

So far, authorities are still in the process of collecting information, and details on exact numbers or the cause of the die off have been scarce. Several turtle species live in the area—hawksbills, leatherbacks, olive ridleys, and green turtles.

Thus far it appears ridleys have been the most impacted.

The die off is reminiscent of similar mortality events in 2013 and 2006, during which about 200 and 120 turtles, respectively, were found dead.

In both of these previous cases, red tide was found to be the cause of the turtles' deaths. ""Red tide"" is a term that commonly refers to when colonies of algal blooms grow out of control. Sometimes, depending on the specific organisms and conditions, they can become toxic for marine life. Flair ups can occur in fresh and salt water, and they can be exacerbated by runoff from chemicals like pesticides or untreated sewer water. For turtles, ingesting the toxic blooms can be deadly.

Mike Liles has lived in El Salvador for the past decade working on turtle conservation as the director of the country's branch of the Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative. From his sources on the ground, Liles has learned that as many as 300 additional dead turtles may have been found in an area called Isla Tasajara 30 miles west of Jiquilisco Bay. El Salvador's environmental ministry has yet to confirm this.

Liles hesitates to blame red tide. That explanation is likely, he says, but nearly impossible to say with certainty—until tide and toxicology reports are released by the government.

Samples from the turtles' corpses have been taken to a toxicology laboratory at the University of El Salvador to determine if the turtles did in fact die from ingesting algal blooms.

Connection to Fishing?

In the past, shrimp trawling has also caused sea turtle die offs. The marine reptiles are often caught as bycatch and drown in the trawl nets that scrape across the ocean floor. El Salvador's fishing industry has been using shrimp trawlers since the sector began to boom in the 1970s.

However, since October 17, a month-long moratorium has been in effect for shrimping in El Salvadorian waters to allow the populations to rebound. Because the moratorium went into place before the turtle corpses were found, Liles thinks fishing is likely not the cause of the massive die off. But he emphasized the practice is generally still dangerous for turtles.

Alexander Gaos, an ecologist at the Conservation Ecology Lab, also hesitates to identify an exact cause until more information is released from the government.

""It seems like in the last decade its happened quite often,"" Gaos said of the turtle die offs.

The Big Picture

While it's one of the largest turtle die offs the country has ever experienced, Liles isn't too worried about the populations as a whole. Ridleys have been among the majority of the turtle corpses, and the species was recently downgraded from being classified as endangered to being classified as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Liles speculated that it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that, as run off from industrial agriculture makes red tides worse and turtle populations begin to rebound, more large-scale die offs could become more common. Gaos agreed and underscored the need for more conservation programs to be in place."

Named for 18th-century Englishman John Montagu, the fourth Earl of Sandwich, the sandwich holds the status of delectable cultural icon. “Sandwiches are part of America like pasta is part of Italy,” says Becky Mercuri, author of American Sandwich. “Ever since our industrialization, it’s been the perfect meal for a nation always on the move.” Countless regional variations reflect local ingredients, crops, or immigrant groups. The following cities lay proud claim to classic sandwiches worthy of a trip.

New York: Reuben

Nebraska or New York? Debate continues about the origins of this grilled assemblage of corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing on rye, but no one doubts the Reuben came of age in the Big Apple’s Jewish delis in the early 20th century. You won’t find a more traditional deli for a Reuben than the city’s oldest, Katz’s Delicatessen, a redbrick institution in the increasingly hip Lower East Side. Take a number as you enter and order from one of the workers who hand-carve some 5,000 pounds of corned beef each week. A narrow Flatiron District luncheonette that’s been visited by the likes of Bono, Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop has reubens with corned beef or turkey; pair one with a New York fountain drink like an egg cream or a lime rickey (a blend of lime juice, seltzer, and cherry syrup).

Philadelphia: Cheesesteak

At the corner of 9th and Passyunk in South Philly, this classic sandwich was born at Pat’s King of Steaks when, in the 1940s, cheese was added to a steak sandwich. But across the street, archrival Geno’s Steaks claims a superior cheesesteak, a combo of melted cheese (American, provolone, or Cheez Whiz) and thinly sliced grilled beef in a long roll with cooked onions and bell peppers. Whose is better? Pat’s chops its meat; Geno’s doesn’t; Pat’s stand is white clapboard; Geno’s is bright orange, and both have outdoor seating. A few blocks away, locals swoon over the gooey cheesesteaks at Cosmi’s Deli, a corner Italian grocery run by the same family since 1932. The lack of tables doesn’t deter regulars, who stand outside executing the “Philadelphia lean” (mouth to sandwich, not sandwich to mouth) to avoid splattering clothes.

Miami: Cuban

The entire sandwich—a sublime marriage of crusty Cuban bread, roast pork bathed in garlicky mojo marinade, ham, Swiss cheese, and pickles—is flattened and toasted in a press. The Cuban arrived in Florida around 1900 with migrant cigar workers from the island. At Versailles Restaurant, the longtime Little Havana haunt of community power brokers, the bread is baked in-house; whether you eat in the dining room or stand with the Spanish-speaking locals at the outside counter, a cafecito (a tiny cup of bracing coffee) is a must. Sandwiches as well as homestyle dishes such as arroz con pollo, lure gallery owners, auto mechanics, and everyone in between to Enriqueta's Cafe; the no-frills, breakfast-lunch joint is located in the central Wynwood area, home to a burgeoning arts scene.

New Orleans: Muffuletta

The aroma of olives hits you upon entering Central Grocery, a timeworn shop that claims to have originated this sandwich in the early 1900s. Named for its round Sicilian sesame bread, the muffuletta is layered with mozzarella, provolone, Italian cold cuts, and chopped olive salad; walk three blocks to enjoy your “muff” (or a half of one—they’re huge) in New Orlean's Jackson Square, the French Quarter park. Several blocks upriver, in a landmark 1797 French colonial town house said to have been offered to the French emperor as a residence in exile, the muffulettas come heated at Napoleon House; classical music wafts through the establishment’s shaded courtyard."

“I primarily photograph birds,” says National Geographic Your Shot photographer and computer engineer by day Sunil Gopalan. “I had photographed two other species of puffins (horned and tufted) before in Alaska, and the only one that was remaining on my list was the Atlantic puffin.”

Gopalan says this particular species of puffin can be found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, but he wanted to find a remote location to shoot photos of them—the less people the better. After conducting some research, he settled on the small island of Fair Isle off the coast of Shetland, in northern Scotland. (Watch a curious puffin befriend a human.)

Shetland’s website calls itself famous for its “birds, knitwear, and historic shipwrecks.” Fair Isle can only be reached by means of a four-hour ferry ride, or a small twin-engine plane, making it a relatively unfrequented, albeit ruggedly beautiful, destination.

Gopalan’s travels took him from the Midwestern United States to Glasgow to Sumburgh, where he boarded a small aircraft to his puffin paradise. While most of his time spent on the island yielded ideal weather, one rainy morning gave him the opportunity to capture something a bit different. Gopalan was thinking about eating breakfast when a rain-drenched puffin appeared carrying a meal of its own.

This was his moment to act, and he snapped photo after photo. The result: stunning portraits of the wild bird with a bountiful feast of tiny fish in its bill, making its way back to bring the haul to its hungry chick. He submitted his best shot online in hopes of being named the 2017 National Geographic Nature Photographer of the Year.

Atlantic puffins spend most of their lives at sea, returning to land only to form breeding colonies during spring and summer. The Atlantic puffin’s beak appears a dull shade of grey during winter, but it changes to a bright orange when spring returns. This change earns it a nickname of “sea parrot.”

When Gopalan visited Fair Isle in July, puffin mothers had already laid their eggs (usually one per nest) upon the rocky, North Atlantic cliffs. During this time, parents take turns feeding their chicks small fish that they catch in their spacious bills. (Watch a baby puffin perform its first solo swim.)

Extremely agile birds, Atlantic puffins steer through the water with rudderlike webbed feet, and dive to depths of up to 200 feet. They typically hunt small fish such as herring or sand eels, and they fly back to their nests at a rapid speed of 400 flaps per minute, reaching speeds up to 55 miles per hour. (See a video of young Icelandic puffins who were saved by children.)

The challenge of shooting speedy birds such as the Atlantic puffin is precisely what makes them his favorite photographic subject, and it drives Gopalan to travel as frequently as possible, to try to capture new species from around the world. He then submits his favorite images on Your Shot. Says Gopalan, “National Geographic is the gold standard for nature enthusiasts. I recall reading old copies of the magazine and imagining what it might be like to go on assignment.”

He says Your Shot is a great way to be involved in the photographic community, and that he is able to keep great company by interacting with other photographers on the platform. “That is the kind of inspiration that everyone needs in order to keep doing better, and the Nature Photographer competition is the highest of bars to aspire for,” he says.

Seven new species of katydids are among the largest and bulkiest insects in the world, a new study says.

Found only on the island of Madagascar, the bugs have the ""biceps"" of a bodybuilder and can be very aggressive—both surprising traits for katydids.

“If you get anywhere near them, they will try to grab you with their powerful forelegs and pull your finger toward their mandibles to give you a nasty bite,” says study co-author George Beccaloni, former curator of katydids and related insects at London’s Natural History Museum. (Beccaloni avoided such injuries by using long forceps to grasp the katydids.)

“I haven’t seen that defensive behavior in any other katydids.""

Strange Bedfellows

Beccaloni and colleagues identified the new species based on museum specimens and samples collected from two trips to Madagascar’s dry forests.

On one expedition, Beccaloni was searching for cockroaches, his specialty, in sheltered areas under rocks and loose bark when he stumbled upon the strange katydids, which can reach lengths of nearly 2.5 inches. (Read about all-pink katydids discovered in Borneo.)

The carnivorous katydids could eat the cockroaches, but the two species appear to tolerate each other, notes Beccaloni, whose study appeared recently in the journal Zootaxa.

“Such shelters are scarce, and it's likely that both the katydids and cockroaches require them for protection against the intense daytime heat and predators,” says Beccaloni.

Lifelong Loves?

Intriguingly, he found several male-female pairs katydids resting side by side—possibly a clue that the insects mate for life, he says.

View Images Some of the newfound katydids were discovered in male-female pairs (pictured, Oncodopus brongniarti) that suggest the insects could be monogamous.

“The possible monogamous, long-term pair formation behavior recorded in this paper is unknown for any other crickets or bushcrickets [another term for katydids], as far as I’m aware,” Karim Vahed, an entomologist at the University of Derby in the U.K. who was not involved in this research, wrote in an email.

“Some crickets show short-term mate-guarding, in which the male stays with his recent mate for an hour or so in order to repel rival males.” (Read about a bushcricket with the world's biggest testicles.)

View Images These giant katydids (pictured, the previously known species C. grandidieri) live in Madagascar's dry forests, which haven't been intensely studied by entomologists.

Monogamy is rare among insects, but it is not unheard of. For instance, some burying beetles stick together to care for their young.

Both experts agree that further research is needed, such as determining whether males follow females outside of their shelters.

Dry Forests in Danger

It might seem odd that science is only now recognizing such huge insects.

View Images A close up of C. grandidieri, a previously identified species of giant katydid in Madagascar.

That's partly because entomologists have focused mainly on the country's rain forests, rather than the dry forests that cover much of Madagascar. (This is why insects rule the world.)

“This is a shame, because the dry forests are even more unusual and special, yet few people know about them and the great threats they are facing,” says Beccaloni.

“Some of these habitats, like the spiny forest, are unlike anything else on the planet, with baobab trees, spectacular succulents, and octopus trees.”

The forests are shrinking due to human activities such as deforestation for charcoal, he adds.

“Considering how threatened Madagascar’s habitats are, it should be a priority to document all the species there before they disappear."""

Although the practice fell out of favor in China for unknown reasons, the tradition still thrives in Taiwan today.

Amid the healing herb shops of Taipei’s timeworn Dinhua Street, Man Na Lo and Chen Jung Lee beat blades of steel down customers’ spines. The soothing scents of ginseng and goji berries are periodically interrupted by the sounds of loud belching—the women’s attempt to expel the sick chi that is believed to transfer from the client to the therapists during this process.

Welcome to Taiwan, where massage therapists pummel butcher knives down your back. Don’t fret, the knives are dulled. But if you’re looking for dainty tea tree oils and gentle pampering, this probably isn’t the spa treatment for you. Knife massages, or dao liao, are nothing like your routine rubdown. Instead of firm hands, dao liao therapists wield butcher knives as conductive tools to direct the flow of positive and negative energy in and out of the skin.

“We’re not a religion. We’re not a science. Our practice is about energy, to help people find their positive chi, to touch their soul,” says Hsiao Mei Fong, who owns the Ancient Art of Knife Therapy Education Center in Taipei. While going under the dao liao knife may look downright violent, these massages can be deeply energizing by stimulating circulation and restoring balance back to the body, Hsiao says.

Her hour-long massages start at 1,200 Taiwanese dollars, ($40), and are recommended for treating chronic conditions like arthritis and insomnia. Everyone from a one-year-old to a 100-year-old has stopped by her shop for a knife massage.

Knife massages aren’t a new fad or a masochistic fantasy. The practice of dao liao is rooted in an ancient tradition that dates back more than 2,000 years. According to research out of Taiwan’s Nanhua University, Buddhist monks offered knife massages to the severely ill after more traditional medicinal methods failed to cure them during the Han and Tang Dynasties.

Although the practice fell out of favor in China for unknown reasons, the uncanny tradition still thrives in Taiwan today. Nowadays, you can find highly trained therapists nestled amongst the narrow alleyways of Dadaocheng, the historic heart of Taipei, tenderizing clients just as monks did in imperial China.

Thanks to the explosive popularity of acupuncture and the rise of Chinese Nobel Prize Winner Tu Youyou, the rest of the world is also slowly starting to adopt the millennia-long wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine, according to University of Buffalo Professor Yan Liu, a scholar of historical Chinese medicine. While some modern medical models tend to be reductionist and target specific microscopic cells and germs that afflict the body, Chinese medicine takes a holistic approach."

We’re talking in the upstairs greenroom of the legendary Blue Note Jazz Club in New York’s Greenwich Village, and he’s explaining what he calls his “B-flat instruments,” which look a bit like space-age weapons. Such innovation is a natural extension of Adjuah’s unorthodox music. Along with fellow jazz musicians Robert Glasper and, more recently, Kamasi Washington, Adjuah has been at the forefront of a generation tearing down the boundaries between genres, with elements of rock, hip-hop and electronic music flowing into jazz recordings and vice versa. Adjuah has collaborated with Thom Yorke and Mos Def; Glasper and Washington worked with Kendrick Lamar on his Grammy-winning 2015 album To Pimp a Butterfly.

Adjuah’s sounds are recognizable—a modification of traditional jazz, with familiar elements—but he welcomes myriad influences, from trap beats to samba rhythms to polka. “Jazz is the original fusion music,” Adjuah says. “Bringing all of this in is the essence of it; the traditional tenets are to constantly search, to look for new terrain, new vernacular and new ways of communicating. But we were up against this notion that it had to be one way.”

Adjuah is about to release the final installment of an ambitious and socially insightful expression of his jazz vernacular, what he calls his “Centennial Trilogy,” three albums commemorating the 100-year anniversary of the first jazz recording: “Livery Staple Blues,” from the Original Dixieland Jass Band. Adjuah and his band are at the Blue Note for a final night of sold-out shows in support of this installment, The Emancipation Procrastination, recorded in just six days but in the works since he was 14. When he was growing up, his musical elders would say, “'When you guys get to be adults, the century mark will be up,'” Adjuah says. “'What are you going to do? How are you going to create beauty out of this moment, how are you going to spark a musical dialogue that will last another century? Are you good enough? Are you valiant enough?' I began the work in that moment.”

His experiences as a teenager in the Upper 9th Ward shaped his music further. “I’ve seen white people enduring food insecurity. I’ve seen black people enduring the same things. They view each other as their nemesis, even though they’re the same people,” he says. “As a social construct, race exists, but it doesn’t, man. There’s no Homo sapiens Africans.""

In time, Adjuah began to find the term jazz “limiting,” so he created a new name, “stretch music,” for a sound free of artificial and arbitrary boundaries, where Kurt Cobain is as much of a blues musician as Muddy Waters. He says, “If I can blur or obliterate the spaces between genres, which are the cultural expressions of the [races] that we’ve carved up, then what am I saying about the people?”

Later that night, as he stood on the Blue Note stage, you could see evidence of Adjuah’s hopeful philosophy on the faces of the beguiled and diverse crowd: Asian, white, black and everything in between. “I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t like sounds,” Adjuah said earlier. “There’s nothing more powerful than the potential music has, to be able to heal people and to get people past that junction. I think we’re going to do it.”

The third and final installment of the Centennial Trilogy, The Emancipation Procrastination, is out October 20 on Adjuah’s label, Stretch Music (via Ropeadope)."

Cristian Farias@cristianafarias,Rochelle Garza was a court-appointed attorney in a case that quickly showed up in national headlines.,2017-11-03T18:57:11.094Z,new-york-magazine,Meet the Texas Lawyer Who Helped an Undocumented Teen Fight for an Abortion,https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/this-lawyer-helped-undocumented-teen-fight-for-an-abortion.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/03/03-rochelle-garza.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"The first time attorney Rochelle Garza stood up to the federal government was in a Texas courthouse one day in late September.

A field representative for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the section of the Department of Health and Human Services that looks after unaccompanied minors, had received word that Garza was there with “Jane Doe,” an undocumented teen who was seeking judicial authorization to opt to have an abortion. A few days earlier, Garza had been court-appointed to represent the 17-year-old as her case made its way through the legal system.

“Hell, no,” Garza recalls thinking when she learned of the ORR official’s presence in the courthouse. The hearing proceeded without the official, even though federal law regards the government as a kind of foster parent for children in federal custody. In this instance, Texas family law stood in the way; strict confidentiality rules shroud these proceedings in secrecy, which meant that, at least in theory, the Trump administration official shouldn’t even have known that the teen was in court that day. After all is said and done in cases like this, “the files get destroyed,” Garza told New York.

But the administration knew, and did everything it could to place obstacles in Doe’s path. Last week, capping a protracted legal battle that captured the nation’s attention but lasted way longer than it should have, Doe was able to end her pregnancy. Looking back on the whirlwind weeks Doe was forced to endure on the ground in Texas, the young lawyer says her client’s ordeal — which spanned courtrooms in Texas and California before heading to Washington, D.C. — “felt like a roller coaster that you can’t make stop.”

Garza, in her capacity as Doe’s court-ordered guardian, is the named plaintiff in Garza v. Hargan, a class-action challenge to what the ACLU calls the Trump administration’s exercise of a “veto power over unaccompanied immigrant minors’ access to abortion in violation of their Fifth Amendment rights,” among other constitutional claims.

The public only learned of Doe’s plight when it made national headlines last month, but by then she had been waiting for nearly a month — since Garza and another local attorney, Marie Christine Cortez, convinced a Texas judge that it was in their client’s “best interest” to let her decide for herself that an abortion was right for her. “She’s in a country she doesn’t know. She doesn’t know the language. She’s in detention. She has no family who can help her,” Garza said, listing off the factors she presented in the chambers of a local judge who then determined Doe was mature enough to make her own decision.

It’s not that Doe didn’t know what she was getting into. Garza said that as soon as Doe learned she was pregnant — via a medical examination that every minor gets when they’re apprehended at the border — she was resolute. “People need to understand that she requested an abortion as soon as she found out that she was pregnant — nine weeks pregnant,” Garza says. That was in early September. That prompted Doe to seek a court order — a so-called “judicial bypass” that, in essence, allows a minor to obtain an abortion without having to inform or get consent from her parents. Or in this case, the Trump administration.

But that’s not how Scott Lloyd rolls. As the Trump official who oversees the care of unaccompanied immigrant minors at HHS, he’s taken a role in personally discouraging pregnant teens in government custody from seeking abortions. “Often these girls start to regret abortion,” Lloyd wrote in March about a teen girl he’d met at a Texas detention center, according to an email obtained by The Wall Street Journal. “If this comes up, we need to connect her with resources for psychological and/or religious counseling.” Local shelters — which subcontract with the federal government to house unaccompanied minors and are often religiously affiliated — don’t seem to put up much of a fight.

And so Doe, against her wishes, was made to sit through religious counseling at an anti-abortion crisis pregnancy center. Doe’s complaint in federal court also says the government contacted her mother back at her native country to let her know about her daughter’s pregnancy and desire to obtain an abortion. Such an egregious violation of her privacy, which even Texas law protects, was an attempt to bring Doe in compliance with the administration’s new policy, announced in March, to forbid all federally contracted shelters “from taking any actions that facilitate” an abortion by teenagers in detention — unless Lloyd himself signs off on it. “The shelter should’ve just released her to me,” Garza said.

That kind of foot-dragging kicked off the fierce legal confrontation that ended up one step short of the Supreme Court: at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which took the unusual step of hearing an expedited appeal in which, in time, nine active judges on the court jumped into the controversy. Even the state of Texas, which should’ve been supportive of Doe’s adherence to Texas law, threw in its two cents — arguing that the teen and other undocumented minors in detention aren’t even “persons” worthy of constitutional protections.

In the end, a 6-to-3 majority on the federal appeals court affirmed a lower-court order barring the Trump administration from blocking Doe’s attempt to obtain an abortion. The ruling was light on reasoning and details, but U.S. Circuit Judge Patricia Millett — who days earlier had gone to town on two conservative colleagues who determined Doe should be kept in administrative limbo until at least October 31 — offered a concurring opinion that illuminated the girl’s struggle.

“The court today correctly recognizes that [Jane Doe]’s unchallenged right under the Due Process Clause affords this 17-year-old a modicum of the dignity, sense of self-worth, and control over her own destiny that life seems to have so far denied her,” Millett wrote. (Over at Slate, Mark Joseph Stern all but crowned her heir apparent to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s women’s rights throne.)

Back in Texas, after Doe had her abortion, Garza expressed relief for her client and gratitude for the outpouring of support she and Doe have received — as well as for the legal backing of her brother and law partner Myles Garza, who fought right by her side, the ACLU, and Jane’s Due Process, a local nonprofit that helps young women like Doe. Still, she can’t help but remain angry at how long the case dragged on. “She was forced by government intervention to be pregnant for longer than she needed to be,” Garza said.

For its part, the Trump administration is not done fighting. In a highly unusual play, DOJ filed a Supreme Court appeal just this Friday accusing the ACLU of moving too quickly to secure Jane’s abortion, which had the effect of thwarting the government’s intention to ask the justices, as a last-ditch effort, to stop the procedure. Reeling from its loss, the administration now wants the Supreme Court to wipe out the D.C. Circuit’s ruling — and whatever value it may have as precedent for other teens in Jane’s position — and maybe even consider “disciplinary action” against the ACLU for misleading the government. The ACLU isn’t having it: “That government lawyers failed to seek judicial review quickly enough is their fault, not ours,” said David Cole, the ACLU’s legal director.

As an attorney, Garza is well aware that she shouldn’t “take home” her client’s problems. But she said she can’t help it — she became a lawyer “to be and advocate for people and people who are vulnerable. And she’s vulnerable.” But that vulnerability ought not to be confused with Doe’s own strength as a person: “I told her many times, ‘Eres muy fuerte. Tienes un caracter muy fuerte,’” Garza said, repeating the Spanish word for strong. And then added: “I don’t know if I would’ve been as strong if I were in her position.”"

Donna Brazile writes in her new book that after Hillary Clinton fell ill with pneumonia in September 2016, she considered replacing the Democratic nominee with Vice-President Joe Biden, the Washington Post reported on Saturday:

In an explosive new memoir, Brazile details widespread dysfunction and dissension throughout the Democratic Party, including secret deliberations over using her powers as interim DNC chair to initiate the removal of Clinton and running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) from the ticket after Clinton’s Sept. 11, 2016, collapse in New York City.

Brazile writes that she considered a dozen combinations to replace the nominees and settled on Biden and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), the duo she felt most certain would win over enough working-class voters to defeat Republican Donald Trump. But then, she writes, “I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them.”

On Thursday, Brazile caused a stir when the first excerpt of the book, Hacks, was published on Politico. In it, Brazile wrote that the Democratic National Committee, which she took control of in 2016, had “rigged” the primary for Hillary Clinton, in part by instituting a quid pro quo system that would give Clinton full control of the organization. The seemingly explosive claim helped reanimate the acrimonious, seemingly never-quite-ending struggle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders partisans. But NBC News later reported that the joint agreement in question only applied to the general election, a claim that took much of the sting out of Brazile’s allegations, since the agreement has been standard operating procedure for many years.

Her Biden deliberation story was more immediately ripe for debunking: The Democratic National Committee chair does not have the power to unilaterally remove a candidate. In the context of what seems to be a pattern of exaggeration, reactions to Saturday’s revelations ranged from dismay to comic disbelief.

This is just gross, and I’m sure Biden would agree. https://t.co/tLNIt0nHfs — Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) November 4, 2017

This is such grandiloquent nonsense. The idea that Brazile had it in her power to do this but had mercy on Clinton’s followers. My god. pic.twitter.com/mBY8rD7y4i — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) November 4, 2017

Donna Brazile: ""I contemplated telling the Atlanta Falcons to not get comfortable after obtaining a 25 point lead in the first half"" — Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) November 4, 2017

Brazile’s book is full of incendiary commentary, the Post reports. She writes that the entire Clinton campaign carried “the odor of failure,” and recounts her personal problems with several top aides, including campaign manager Robby Mook. She writes about an exchange in which she told three campaign officials to stop treating her like “Patsey the slave,” a reference to the movie 12 Years a Slave. She calls President Obama, Clinton, and ex–Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz “three titanic egos” who had “stripped the party to a shell for their own purposes.”

Most bizarrely, she writes of fearing for her life after the murder of Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose death has been the locus of deranged Republican conspiracy theories surrounding WikiLeaks and Hillary Clinton’s emails.

Whether Brazile’s apparent fabulism will be dismissed as a bookselling stunt or cause any real internecine conflict among Democrats is unclear. But with a pivotal, uncomfortably close gubernatorial election just around the corner in Virginia, one thing’s for sure: The timing for a massive distraction for the party could scarcely be worse."
Dee Lockett,Actress Paz de la Huerta says Weinstein raped her twice in 2010.,2017-11-03T21:39:27.491Z,new-york-magazine,NYPD Considering Arrest Warrant for Harvey Weinstein for Alleged Rape,http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/nypd-might-arrest-harvey-weinstein-for-alleged-rape.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/03/03-harvey-weinstein.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Photo: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/via Getty Images

Harvey Weinstein’s arrest could be imminent, the NYPD now tells the AP. After actress Paz de la Huerta came forward to police accusing Weinstein of raping her twice in 2010, officials now say they’re building a case to bring the first criminal charges against the disgraced mogul. Based on interviews with de la Huerta and information that corroborates her story, chief of detectives Robert Boyce told the AP on Friday that they are proceeding with her case. He says de la Huerta demonstrated “the ability to articulate each and every minute of the crime, where she was, where they met, where this happened and what he did.” The NYPD will now either get a court order for an arrest warrant, or allow prosecutors to seek indictment from a grand jury. The Manhattan district attorney’s office confirmed to the AP that a senior prosecutor is now investigating the allegations.

According to Boyce, if the facts were slightly different, Weinstein might already be in handcuffs: “If this person was still in new York, and it was recent, we’d go right away and make the arrest. No doubt. But we’re talking about a 7-year-old case. And we have to move forward gathering evidence first.” Weinstein has been spotted in disguise in Arizona after completing treatment at a local rehab for sex addiction. Another detective previously told Vanity Fair that he believes “we have enough to make an arrest.”"

On Thursday, HuffPost provided a crucial update on the case against Danny Masterson, the actor and Scientologist best known for That ’70s Show. Four women have accused Masterson of raping them in the early 2000s, and the case is currently sitting in the Los Angeles district attorney’s office. So far, no charges have been filed — the case has been “slow rolled,” according to a source — and Masterson denies the accusations. But the women who say Masterson raped them seem eager to be heard.

Tony Ortega, a journalist who focuses on exposing abuses in the Church of Scientology, reported Friday morning that former Scientologist Leah Remini interviewed some, or all, of Masterson’s accusers for an episode of her A&E show Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath. According to Ortega, the episode has been shelved, while the district attorney’s office continues to investigate. “We’re told that earlier this year, Remini and her co-star Mike Rinder met with the Los Angeles district attorney’s office, which expressed concerns about the episode airing while it is considering whether or not to file charges against Masterson,” Ortega reports. “Remini, not wanting to jeopardize the investigation, asked A&E not to air the episode, and the network agreed.”

The Los Angeles Police Department began investigating Masterson in late 2016 and referred the case to the district attorney’s office in April 2017. Per HuffPost, there is “overwhelming” evidence against Masterson, including “audiotapes, emails sent to and from Scientology officers at the time the alleged rapes happened, forensic computer evidence and a threatening handwritten letter Masterson sent to one of the alleged victims,” but charges have yet to be approved for filing. Masterson has hired power attorneys Thomas Meserau (who defended Bill Cosby) and Marty Singer (who works with Brett Ratner, among others) to defend him.

We have reached out to Remini for comment about the episode and will update if we hear back."

On Tuesday, Netflix suspended production on the sixth season of House of Cards following allegations of sexual harassment and assault made against its star Kevin Spacey. CNN subsequently published a report in which eight people alleged Spacey sexually harassed and assaulted young men on set. Now, in the wake of more men stepping forward to accuse the actor of assault and harassment, Netflix has apparently decided that Kevin Spacey will have no part in any of the streaming platform’s upcoming productions.

“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of House of Cards that includes Kevin Spacey,” a Netflix spokesperson told Variety in a statement. “We will continue to work with MRC during this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the show. We have also decided we will not be moving forward with the release of the film Gore, which was in post-production, starring and produced by Kevin Spacey.” While Spacey has not been explicitly let go from the show, Netflix’s statement seemingly suggests House of Cards has two options going forward: Fire Spacey or find the series a new home. House of Cards was in early production before public allegations against the actor started to mount earlier this week."

There was a giddiness in D.C. this week, as the fantasy of removing Trump by impeachment seemed marginally less fantastic. I do not begrudge this excitement for a millisecond. God knows we could do with some cheer. Hope also came from the latest polls, which show Trump sliding ever more deeply in public esteem. FiveThirtyEight’s poll of polls now shows Trump near record lows: 38.0 percent approval with 56.4 percent disapproval. Gallup now has his disapproval around 60 percent. The possibility that the various hoodlums, sleaze merchants, and swamp creatures involved in Trump’s campaign might have witlessly talked to a wired Papadopoulos for the last few months is straight out of House of Cards. In D.C., we cannot get enough of this.

But on Fox, none of this was happening at all. And next Tuesday, we will get a dose of outside-the-bubble political reality. Ed Gillespie and Ralph Northam will be duking it out in the Virginia governor’s race in an evenly balanced, but Democratic-trending, state. It has morphed into a real-life test of how strong Trumpism will be in 2018, how effective the Democrats are as an alternative, and the future of the country. I don’t know what the result will be. But it is not looking good — for the Democrats or the country as a whole.

Northam seems to me almost a classic Democratic politician of our time. I have no idea what his core message is (and neither, it seems, does he); on paper, he’s close to perfect; his personality is anodyne; his skills as a campaigner are risible; and he has negative charisma. More to the point, he is running against an amphibian swamp creature, Ed Gillespie, and yet the Washington lobbyist is outflanking him on populism. Northam’s ads are super lame, and have lately been largely on the defensive, especially on crime, culture, and immigration. He hasn’t galvanized minority voters, has alienated many white voters, and has failed to consolidate a broader anti-Trump coalition. In Virginia, Trump’s approval rating is 38/59, but Northam is winning only 81 percent of the disapprovers, while Gillespie is winning 95 percent of the approvers. Northam’s early double-digit lead has now collapsed to within the margin of error.

If all this sounds like a rerun of 2016, well, that’s what it is. But insofar as it also represents Trump’s consolidation of the GOP, it’s all too 2017. Ed Gillespie is the last person you’d predict to become a Trump-style populist, and bring out the enraged base. He’s deeply Establishment, formerly moderate, and easily identified as part of the Washington-as-usual crowd. And yet he’s morphed — successfully — into a Bannonite, without losing mainstream Republican support. Somehow, the GOP still manages to rally together; and somehow, even now, the Democrats cannot. Gillespie also has a killer instinct. Putting what’s left of his conscience and decency in cold storage, he has been pushing out ads that make the Willie Horton spot look like Mr. Rogers. One ad targets Northam for believing that the Confederate statues should come down or be placed in museums; another blasts him for his waffling on sanctuary cities (in a state where none exist!) and links him to weakness against the MS-13 gang; another all but calls him sympathetic to pedophiles. The ads are brutal, foul, racist, demagogic, and effective. They embrace Trumpism with fervor and shamelessness and, in Gillespie’s case, staggering cynicism.

Now go to Northam’s website and you see a near-copy of Clinton’s agenda last year. Drenched in wonky micro-policies, one of its exhausted themes is actually “Working Together.” If you plumb the message, behind various poll-tested good-government bromides, he even has policy proposals on concussions and STEM curricula, and a smoking ban. This is Establishment Democratic boilerplate. And Democratic turnout, in response, looks wobbly, especially among minority voters.

Enter the resurgent activist left. Yes, the party needs more direct aggression and energy and left-populism. But the Latino Victory Fund, worried about low Latino enthusiasm, put out an ad last week that shows how much of the energy in the party is now dominated by the fight against “white supremacy.” And so the LVF ad would give your average Vox or Coates reader an intersectional orgasm — while dooming the party on the ground. It depicts a white man in dark glasses in a pickup truck wth Gillespie and tea party bumper stickers, brandishing a Confederate flag, and driving aggressively through a suburban neighborhood, terrifying young Latino and Muslim kids, and forcing them into a back alley. Just as this Republican terrorist seems about to murder the children, the scene changes and we realize that this was all a nightmare for the kids. And they wake up. This, the ad hammers home, is what the “American dream” means for the GOP. Cue to scenes from Charlottesville.

The ad was aimed at Latino voters. But, of course, it went viral, instantly erasing Northam’s relatively clean image, and tripling contributions to Gillespie’s campaign overnight. It helped cement the Trump base’s support for Gillespie. It seemed to imply that every Virginia Republican is a terrorizing white supremacist, and makes the fatal Clinton mistake of attacking a swath of actual voters. And, of course, it was about immigration. The GOP are on the smart side of this issue; the Democrats still don’t have a clue. In one final flailing, Northam first distanced himself from the ad, and then was shown to have helped finance it. Then the GOP managed to ambush him on the bogus “sanctuary city” issue. In the closing stages of the campaign, he said he would now veto any attempt to establish such a law-free enclave, a position he had once voted against. Even now, it appears, the Democrats have no practiced response to a GOP attack on this question. They don’t want to offend Latinos, and they don’t want to alienate whites. So they twist in the populist wind. Are they capable of focusing on economic populism and a defense of the working classes against GOP plutocracy? At this point, the answer is no.

This is not a good omen. If Gillespie wins, or the result is close, it means the Trump-transformed GOP is electorally viable in every swing district in 2018. That it could win in the state where actual white supremacists marched this past summer and when the president is 20 points underwater is a sobering reminder of the actual state of play in our politics. I can only hope it’s a wake-up call to the Dems. In 2017, they are either useless or actively counterproductive in the struggle to resist right-authoritarianism. They have learned nothing from 2016. Their intelligentsia seems determined to ensure that no midwestern whites ever vote for the party again. Their public faces are still Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, and Nancy Pelosi. They still believe that something other than electoral politics — the courts, the press, the special counsel — will propel them back to power. They can’t seem to grasp the nettle of left-populism. And they remain obsessed with a Russia scandal that most swing voters don’t give a damn about.

They think they are “woke.” They are, in fact, in a political coma.

Seriously, Put Down Your Phone

If you haven’t read Jean Twenge’s book on how Steve Jobs’s legacy is destroying the happiness and well-being of an entire generation, I highly recommend it. It’s deeply disturbing. Some stats from her Atlantic excerpt:

The number of teens who get together with their friends nearly every day dropped by more than 40 percent from 2000 to 2015; the decline has been especially steep recently … Eighth-graders who are heavy users of social media increase their risk of depression by 27 percent, while those who play sports, go to religious services, or even do homework more than the average teen cut their risk significantly. Teens who spend three hours a day or more on electronic devices are 35 percent more likely to have a risk factor for suicide, such as making a suicide plan … As teens have started spending less time together, they have become less likely to kill one another, and more likely to kill themselves. In 2011, for the first time in 24 years, the teen suicide rate was higher than the teen homicide rate.

Smartphones have not just increased depression, isolation, and anxiety for an entire generation, they also impair cognitive function for all of us. This much is proven, but it may be true even when you’re not looking at the bloody thing:

Results from two experiments indicate that even when people are successful at maintaining sustained attention—as when avoiding the temptation to check their phones—the mere presence of these devices reduces available cognitive capacity. Moreover, these cognitive costs are highest for those highest in smartphone dependence.

The effects in that study are small, and need replicating, but make sense to me. If I have my phone in my pocket, a small part of my brain is thinking about checking it, or waiting to check it, or otherwise marginally distracted from the task at hand. One way I’ve found to counter this proactively is meditation or silence with eyes closed for 30 minutes a day. I’ve found this is most effective if you do it before the day really begins. It helps steady the addled mind, twitching and eager for an iPhone update. It’s helped to turn off all notifications — as long as you don’t then compulsively check every app for updates. And then there’s simply leaving the phone at home as often as I can. Walking my beagles twice a day, phone-free, helps. Every few minutes, I get an addictive tug to consult the black mirror, but when it’s not there at all, my mind slowly calms and I start seeing the actual world again. The same thing happens at the gym if I leave the phone in my locker. It’s just an hour of pushing weights around — but you’d be surprised how your mind wanders in that little oasis, and how creative and productive that wandering can be.

If you need to do some concentrated reading, I’ve found going to a local coffee shop without a phone is helpful. Going back to a watch to tell the time also helps you leave it behind. Ditto an old-school alarm clock for the bedroom. Or setting a time each day to look at Twitter, preferably on a laptop or iPad. Every little roadblock helps. Then there’s simply what humans used to call the Sabbath. Pick a weekend day and make it phone-free — or at least as phone-free as anyone can in our overconnected age. You might be surprised at the relief you feel, the absence of stress, of compulsion, of distraction. You might reconsider the deep wisdom of the great religions in insisting on such a space apart from the deadliness of constant doing.

And last week, I tried an app to counter the apps. It’s called Moment. It measures your phone time throughout the day, and tells you which apps and habits are driving your use. I was shocked at how much time I spend looking at the little shiny gizmo, and surprised by which apps took away most of my daily life. It also helps you cut down. You can set yourself a daily limit — say, three hours — and each half-hour the phone will ping you to show you how much time you’ve already spent. When your three hours are up, it sets off an alarm. When you blow through your limit — and you will — it just keeps reminding you how far over the limit you’ve gone. It can’t stop you but it can help you. This epidemic is not going away. I keep relapsing. But we can try to develop habits and practices that help. Short of checking yourself into a monastery, it may be the best you can do.

Are Students Finally Rebelling Against PC?

My buddy and former Dish colleague Chris Bodenner reports from Reed College — that super-liberal but also old-school-rigorous school in Oregon (colloquially also known as Weed College). It’s another center for intersectional cry-bullies. Here’s a message from a leader of the Reed Against Racism group, or RAR, that has successfully traumatized, silenced, and intimidated professors teaching Reed’s classic humanities curriculum, i.e., “white supremacy.” It is from a Facebook post directed at Reed students not showing sufficient dedication to disrupting lectures:

To all the white & able(mentally/physically) who don’t come to sit-ins(ever, anymore, rarely): all i got is shade for you. [… If] you ain’t with me, then I will accept that you are against me. There’s 6 hums left, I best be seein all u phony ass white allies show-up. […] How you gonna be makin all ur white supremacy messes & not help clean-up your own community by coming and sitting for a frickin hour & still claim that you ain’t a laughin at a lynchin kinda white.

But the problem the chiding RAR leader was identifying — insufficient ideological zeal among students — was becoming real. The shutting down of lectures was beginning to wear thin on many students, especially those who thought they were going to school to learn something other than anti-racism. And this year, the freshman class began to rebel. The uprising started after the usual disruption of a humanities class on the first day of school. The RAR protesters interrupted the professor, grabbed the mic, and declared “[our] work is just as important as the work of the faculty, so we were going to introduce ourselves as well.” And then:

The pushback from freshmen first came over Facebook. “To interrupt a lecture in a classroom setting is in serious violation of academic freedom and is just unthoughtful and wrong,” wrote a student from China named Sicheng, who distributed a letter of dissent against RAR. Another student, Isabel, ridiculed the group for its “unsolicited emotional theater.” … [In a subsequent open mic session organized by RAR,] Rollo, a freshman from Houston, described how difficult it was to grow up poor, black, and gay in Texas. He then turned to RAR: “No, I won’t subject myself to your politically correct ideas. No, I won’t allow myself to be a part of your cause.” He criticized the “demagoguery” that “prevents any comprehensive conversation about race outside of ‘racism is bad.’”

Read the whole thing. The protests against the protests have since spread — led by students of color.

I’ve been despairing about the future of education given the climate on campuses, and have been dismayed by how easily so many students have been brainwashed by their PC professors, and intimidated by their peers. But, just as in the 1990s, that wave of extremism may be cresting and even faltering, as more and more students realize that real transformation comes not from shutting down debate and learning, but from actually opening both up.

Know hope.

And see you next Friday."

Like President Trump’s previous big foreign trips to Europe and the Middle East, his ten-day Asia trip promises plenty of fodder for GIFs, gaffes, and spectacle. Already, the Economist is reporting that Japanese department stores have put Trump’s Virginia wines on sale at large markups. China’s ambassador to the U.S. is referring to the level of pomp it plans for the visit as “head-of-state-plus.”

Given the troubled history of U.S.–China summits, that “plus” could mean just about anything. George H.W. Bush famously threw up at a banquet, and Bill Clinton had a great humiliation when a staffer had a banner calling the relationship a “strategic partnership” hung, only to have to take it down (in front of reporters) after Cabinet officials vetoed the idea that the relationship with the repressive regime was a “strategic partnership.”

But behind the tweets, here are four of the key areas that beleaguered American diplomats will focus on — often with their fingers crossed that the president doesn’t do something rash to undermine U.S. interests (or safety):

Keeping the North Korea situation under control. Trump’s hosts in Japan, China, and South Korea — who seldom agree on much — broadly share the goal of convincing him to give diplomacy time to work. While many regional leaders seem to discount the president’s bellicose tweets, and take seriously the reassurances of career military leaders and diplomats, they are still anxious — and South Korea, in particular, is sitting on an anti-war public. Trump’s hosts are caught in an unpleasant dilemma. They do not want to face the bellicose and unpredictable Pyongyang regime without Washington’s military might, and so they will seek to make the president happy and look for reassurance that the U.S. will defend them. But they don’t want those reassurances to take the form of more coded threats of preventive war, or intimations that “time is running out.” And Trump’s Cabinet seems as invested as he in ratcheting up pressure. These conversations will be intense. Trump’s hosts hope they will remain private. We’ll see.

A meeting with Russia? Yes, you read that right. Even as rumors of more Russia-related indictments fly back home, President Trump told Fox’s Laura Ingraham that he “might” have a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, because he’s important on North Korea. The Russian government didn’t confirm that, however, saying instead that a meeting was “being discussed.” (That’s diplomat-speak for “I might have to wash my hair.”) Moscow will use Trump’s public ask for a meeting to try to get something from him in return. (What might it be?)

We’ll also get a chance to judge whether National Security Adviser McMaster and Chief of Staff John Kelly have gotten enough control of the process that American officials will accompany the president to all meetings this time, unlike his spring meeting with Putin with just a Russian government interpreter present. The media availability after that session should be a real treat, too — American prosecutors will no doubt be taking copious notes.

Bringing home some bacon: Like most presidential trips, this one will feature big-sounding announcements of trade and investment deals at each stop. Japan will promise to buy American natural gas; China will announce energy investments in Texas and the Virgin Islands. Business commentators are dismissing these as “small potatoes,” and suggesting the shopping basket is empty on the really big questions: While our Asian allies want to see the U.S. commit to regional economic partnerships, even after the U.S. departure from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the voices inside the administration who see U.S. global economic engagement happening on a country-by-country basis seem to be winning. Even there, though, the president has threatened to tear up the U.S.–South Korea trade agreement, and Seoul will be watching anxiously. The White House says the president’s speech in Danang, Vietnam, will showcase the administration’s answer to Chinese efforts at regional economic integration. Of course, TPP was supposed to be the U.S. answer to Chinese efforts at regional economic integration. Market imbalances and other trade issues with China are real — if the administration has a plan beyond rhetoric, or a set of tools beyond an already-announced government-wide review of U.S. frustrations with China, it hasn’t shown its hand. That will make for a smooth visit and good visuals next week; but it is unlikely to produce upticks in jobs or exports for Trump voters, or anyone else, in the years ahead.

Nationalists unite! The Asian diplomatic circuit, where subtlety is prized, and commerce is fondly believed to trump racism, might seem to offer a break from the us-and-them polarization of U.S. cultural discourse. Don’t bet on it.

President Trump seems most comfortable with a set of regional authoritarians — Philippine president Duterte most notorious among them— as well as governments in Tokyo and New Delhi which rely heavily on nationalism for their support. These regimes also have significant domestic constituencies in the U.S., so courting them pays off politically at home. The president’s last two big international speeches, at the U.N. in September and Poland in July, focused on the sovereignty of individual nations, and the value of strengthening countries from within their own borders to fight cultural and political enemies. That rhetoric will translate quite well to nationalist regimes in Asia. But it’s hard to overstate how far that is from 60 years of U.S. rhetoric and policy, where the central themes were shared goals that transcended nationalism as a central path to avoiding bloodshed and privation on the levels Asia saw in World War II. It’s also hard to imagine how nationalistic policies help build common pressure against North Korea’s Kim Jong-un or deal with shared economic menaces such as piracy and cybercrime.

Buckle your seatbelts. This trip won’t be boring."
Hunter Harris@hunteryharris,"Leaving Thor freed him up to pursue his other hobbies: music videos, stand-up, pottery.",2017-11-03T14:11:21.038Z,new-york-magazine,"An Interview With Thor’s Wig: He’s Not in Thor: Ragnarok, But He’s Fine With It",http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/an-interview-with-thor-wig-yes-he-skipped-thor-ragnarok.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/03/03-thor-hair.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Photo: Marvel Studios/Walt Disney Studios

I can hear Thor’s Wig spritzing something near the receiver before I hear his deep, leathery voice (he sort of sounds like Jimmy Tatro in American Vandal). Later, he tells me it’s something called Sachajuan Ocean Mist Spray. I dumbly ask if that’s a hair spray. “No, it’s a salt spray,” he says.

Thor’s Wig and I are participating in a 25-minute phone interview to discuss his exit from Thor: Ragnarok, which was revealed in an interview with Taika Waititi in the New York Times and which he promises was entirely mutual. Thor’s Wig — who has appeared as himself in the previous two Thor movies — is still coming to terms with his exit, but he’s eager to share how happy he is about it. Leaving Thor freed him up to pursue his other hobbies: music videos, stand-up, pottery. He’s not even upset about Thor’s new hair, which he says harkens back to an earlier time: “It’s very 2007 postmodern. It’s a real aesthetic choice.”

But I can’t help but wonder if Thor’s Wig feels even remotely upset about being cast aside. Will he be the lone detractor of this bubbly, goofy movie, which has been almost universally praised? “Never,” he says solemnly. “I have nothing but love for Marvel, but it was time for me to go. Humans are made to consume content. I’m made to be on top of their heads while they’re making it. I’m needed center stage, so it was time to bow out.”

Take me back: How did you get involved with Marvel?

I was made for this. I know people say that as kind of a cutesy, tongue-in-cheek thing, but no. I was literally made for this. My mantra is, “Are you not entertained?” That’s from Gladiator. I was made to entertain, but I always knew that Marvel itself would never be my end-all be-all. I know it’s hard for people to understand, but I don’t really care about one-liners or bad guys. I’m an artist.

Can you explain the terms of your departure to me?

It was … [long exhale] It was, like, a mutual parting of the ways. To be honest with you, it felt like a breakup. A mutual breakup. They were sad to see me go. They asked me to stay on longer, but I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t be apart of the whole … machine.

But Taika told the Times you were Ragnarok’d. They cut you out.

You know, I’m not really into spin. I’m not a publicist. I just wanted out, and they happened to be entertaining these ideas of a haircut at the same time.

Okay, so … when was a final decision reached?

My agent — she represents me and the dreads that Travolta wears in Battlefield Earth, and that Morgan Freeman wore in Ben-Hur — met with them. “They’ve decided to go in a different direction,” she said. And I said, “Great, because I, too, would like to pursue other things.”

Did you hear from fans about the decision to give the character short hair? Were they disappointed? Was there backlash?

Oh yeah. Yeaaaaaaah. I don’t know if you saw, but the blogs were all over it. Like … “Where’s Thor’s hair?” “The hair makes the man,” that sort of thing. I mean, they tried to add those little lines on Chris’s scalp, make him look a little rugged, a little more buff. See, I was never there so he could adhere to some traditional masculine fantasy. I’m a lace front. My work is elegant. Delicate. Once I saw they added those little lines to his cut, I knew I wouldn’t come back. Like … I’m not trying to cause drama, dude, but who do you think you are? Kanye?

Wait — sorry — just so I have this correctly, they did or did not ask you back?

They did not make the offer, but they also didn’t not make the offer … You know, look: I might be happy to work with Marvel again, down the line. Maybe I could do some work with Tessa Thompson if she ever gets the spin-off she deserves. But no, I won’t be doing another Thor movie. That was a clean break.

What was it like to work with Chris?

He’s a good guy. If I had my choice of all the Chrises, I’d probably go for Pine — that’s a scalp I’m itching to get on. But Hemsworth is a cool dude, mostly. Super conscientious, very funny. I get the sense that he kind of misses me, that we made a good team.

He told Entertainment Weekly that when he didn’t have the wig on he felt like he could “move and speak and react differently.”

Right, that’s just bros exchanging some jokes.

But then he told Kimmel that he didn’t like spending two hours in the chair, getting you on and off.

I thought this was Vulture — I wasn’t told you were going to twist my words. Look, we didn’t have a contrarian relationship.

[Thor’s Wig asks to go off the record]

So what about Loki’s Wig?

Some people you just don’t get along with, you know? We have a big brother–little brother relationship. We do great work together, but yeah, I guess there’s a little animosity there. But I don’t let it affect me. I had a great job for a lot of years that I decided to step away from because art isn’t just big budgets, VFX. What we do, as lace fronts … it’s like Kristen Stewart says: “It’s worldwide.”

Ok.

But yeah, anyway, he’s a total weirdo. He’ll never confirm this, but I know for a fact that he put himself on tape to audition for Beyoncé between Dark World and Ragnarok. He wanted in on Lemonade real bad. First of all, everyone knows Beyoncé’s wigs are on private retainer. They work for her exclusively.

But you are in the first few Ragnarok scenes. What was it like shooting those New York scenes?

I love New York. I love working with Odin’s Wig, too. Now that guy’s a class act. When we get together, whoo boy. You’ve heard of the Pussy Posse? We’re like the Mane Mob. That’s what we call ourselves: Me, the Odin wig, Nicole Kidman’s Lion wig, a couple of locks from Johnny Depp’s Pirates wigs. We have a good time.

Now that your time with Marvel is over, what’s next for you? Who do you want to work with?

I did some work with the porgs on Last Jedi. I’m trying to get in on the Girls Trip sequel. I’d love to do some work with some of the lady lace fronts I really look up to: the hair pieces Brad Pitt wore in Troy, De Niro’s Taxi Driver wig. And this is gonna sound crazy, but: Yorgos Lanthimos. Oh, and Annette Bening, absolutely. I caught a couple minutes of The Women on HBO recently. She looks great in a bob. I think we could work well together. Imagine all three of us together. Now that’d be something."

I’ve gotten to play around with it for a few hours, and can confirm that it’s all-around a pretty great phone. But the most important thing you need to know about it right now is that it’s going to change your selfie game forever.

I’m serious. Taking selfies on the iPhone X is a religious experience. Gone are the shaky-handed, perma-blurry thumb pics; in their place are selfies so well-lit and clear that your friends will think you hired a photographer.

The iPhone X selfies are exquisite for a number of reasons — the front camera now boasts a seven-megapixel camera, auto-image stabilization, and an ƒ/2.2 aperture (in layman’s terms: The front camera is freaking great for its size) — but by far, the most important is the phone’s Portrait Mode.

Photo: Paris Martineau

Ah, Portrait Mode. This incredible feature — which makes basically every photo you take look fantastic by using AI to determine which parts of your shot need to be focused, and which can be a little blurry in order to give you that ever-elusive This-Was-Totally-Shot-on-a-Much-Nicer-Camera vibe — can also technically be found on both the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8 Plus. But on those phones, it’s only on the rear-facing (other people) camera. What sets the X apart is that it has Portrait Mode on both the back camera and the front-facing (me, me, me) camera. Which means glorious, glorious selfies.

Photo: Paris Martineau

What Portrait Mode selfies really bring to the table is Portrait Lighting. Though Portrait Lighting was technically first introduced on the iPhone 8 Plus, it really comes into its own when used to snap a close-up picture of your own face. Portrait Lighting provides you with four different preset auto-filters that make changes to the lighting and color of your shot, which often totally removes the need for most basic edits.

Photo: Paris Martineau

If you want to get the best results, I’d recommend using Portrait Lighting only when taking selfies with a simple background. As you can see in the examples above, while the baseline photo quality is good, the busy background (and general craziness of my hair) causes the AI to mess up and misapply the Portrait Mode blur and other added Lighting effects, which isn’t exactly cute.

Photo: Paris Martineau

That being said, Portrait Mode by itself really excels when used with interesting backgrounds if you give it time to properly align the blur levels. The above photos were taken with minimal positioning, and they look pretty undeniably great for a quick street selfie. What can I say? A little bokeh makes honestly everything better."

On Tuesday, Bill de Blasio will crush his opponents, become the first Democrat to win reelection as mayor of New York City since 1985, and deliver a grievous blow to Donald Trump and his odious agenda for America.

At least that is how de Blasio is selling it, as he brings out Bernie Sanders to ride the A train and Elizabeth Warren to fundraise on his behalf. His opponent in this race is not Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican assemblywoman from Staten Island who trails by 30 points or more in most polls, nor is it Bo Dietl, the Trumpian court jester who trails by even more, and who appears to be running the race to land a late-night spot on the Fox Business Network. Rather, the mayor is running for reelection against the president. “We will stand up to Donald Trump every single day,” de Blasio said on the day that Sanders came to campaign alongside him. “So long as he’s in the White House, this city cannot be as fair as it needs to be unless we take him on.”

Malliotakis has painted de Blasio as a corrupt Che Guevara whose second term will consist mostly of raising taxes to sandblast any reference to Christopher Columbus off city streets. She has been brushed off by de Blasio though, who never misses a chance to conflate the back-bench assemblywoman with the leader of the free world (thus, in different ways, elevating both GOP politicians).

In this multi-candidate field — former councilman Sal Albanese is also running, on the Reform Party line — it is hard to say what constitutes a mandate, especially one where turnout will likely fall below even 2013’s historic low. If there has been an asterisk to de Blasio’s mayoralty, it is that he won in 2013 with just a 24 percent turnout, which was less than the previous low of four years prior. To do what they can to gin up the numbers, the de Blasio campaign has embarked on a months-long effort to get New Yorkers interested in the race, with neighborhood-by-neighborhood phone banking and door-knocking. To date, the campaign has made about half a million phone calls and held nearly 1,000 campaign events. Regardless of how successful this effort is, unless somehow the margin of victory drops into the single digits, expect de Blasio to gloss over how few voters actually cast a ballot and tout the results as a validation of the last four years.

He will have a point. If de Blasio bests Bloomberg’s 19-point margin of victory in 2005, he will have two historically large wins under his belt — the first being 2009’s 49-point romp over Joe Lhota. And if de Blasio has not solved the central issue that he ran on four years ago — dramatically lessening the city’s yawning gap between the rich and poor — he has proven something else: that a mayor of New York can be aggressively left-wing without the city reverting back to someplace that looks like the soundstage for a gritty ’70s film remake. The key political validator for de Blasio is not, in other words, that he instituted universal prekindergarten, rolled out a plan to add 200,000 units of affordable housing, ended stop-and-frisk, or mandated paid sick leave for 3.4 million workers; it’s that the city’s economy grew and crime remained down while he did it.

But when he tells his own version of the story of his mayoralty, de Blasio will not mention the extent to which he has benefited from a string of remarkable political luck, from the implosion of Anthony Weiner and John Liu to Trump’s victory last November. The outcome of the presidential election scared off the handful of Democrats who may have thought it worthwhile to challenge someone with an approval rating that has remained stuck at around 50 percent for most of his term, and who had been nagged by a series of questions about the legality of some of his conduct. There remains a persistent sense among the electorate that —evidenced by his late-morning gym visits, extended Italian vacations, and flailing forays onto the national stage — governing New York City is not always Mayor de Blasio’s focal point.

Fulfilling even the modest goal of grabbing 60 percent of the vote amid dismal turnout would put de Blasio back in the national conversation —f or better or worse. De Blasio’s attempt to be a progressive validator of the 2016 Democratic primary was a fiasco (anyone remember “The Progressive Contract With America“?) and has left him eclipsed by other big-city mayors like Los Angeles’s Eric Garcetti, or even medium-sized-city mayors like Pete Buttigieg of South Bend or the newly elected Randall Woodfin of Birmingham. But another landslide win would for an unabashed left-winger in America’s leading city would give de Blasio another chance. Friends and advisers say de Blasio seems to want a redo on the national front and will incorporate the lessons from the last time out. A different political ecosystem, one where it isn’t Hillary vs. Bernie but a multi-candidate free-for-all where the party’s left wing is ascendent, could leave de Blasio as a kind of lefty arbiter.

In policy and governance, de Blasio’s next four years are likely to look much like the last four — prioritizing affordable housing, free schooling for 3-year-olds, and consistent efforts to raise taxes on the rich and level the playing field for everyone else. But de Blasio is likely to find local Democrats less dependable in their support for him this time around. If he continues to squabble with Andrew Cuomo, it may be an ugly four years —although the sight of the frenemies standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the wake of the Halloween terrorist attack reveals that some kind of thaw may be imminent. Both leaders want that, say aides to each.

Tuesday is surely not de Blasio’s final political moment, and may not even be his last time on a ballot. He is only 56 and has spent his whole life in politics. With a big win, he is sure to be whispered about as a 2020 contender, although advisers say he is well aware that being New York City’s mayor has always been the capstone of a political career.

“This isn’t Giuliani’s city anymore, or Bloomberg’s city, where you aren’t sure that the city is really going to survive,” says one de Blasio adviser. “It’s a city that is concerned about equality, justice, affordability, the environment. He is going to win because this is where New York City is right now. And it’s where the national Democratic Party is. And it’s where Bill de Blasio is.”"

On Friday, he also saw a nice bump to his bank account.

The Cleveland Browns increased Thomas' 2017 pay by $1.5 million via a roster bonus that was due Friday (Nov. 3), NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported. Thomas is also receiving a $3.5 million raise in 2018 in the form of a March roster bonus, which was increased from $1 million to $3 million, and a base salary increase from $8.8 million to $10.3 million, Pelissero added.

When adding the increases for 2018 (plus a $200,000 workout bonus), Thomas is scheduled to earn $13.5 million in cash next year.

The increase in the March roster bonus replaces an escalator in his contract that would have triggered a $2 million bonus for Thomas making the Pro Bowl, which is now unlikely after Thomas' torn triceps ended his season after just seven games. With the Browns' franchise tackle making the Pro Bowl in each of his 10 professional seasons, his 11th appearance was essentially guaranteed. Cleveland's increase of Thomas' roster bonus ensures the tackle will be paid for his achievements, even if an injury likely robbed him of such an honor for 2017.

What's clear here is the Browns are doing their best to show their appreciation for Thomas' contributions over the last decade, which save for 2007 has been filled with ineptitude at almost every position except left tackle. Cleveland is also attempting to incentivize Thomas' return.

Thomas' contract runs through 2018, but he did mention thoughts of retirement in a recent piece he wrote as a guest contributor for The MMQB. It's obvious that the Browns are trying to keep the future Hall of Fame tackle from hanging it up, showing him the money now and hoping it will be enough when Thomas is healthy enough to make an informed decision on his career."

Unfortunately for Dennis Allen's unit, they will likely have to continue to do so for the rest of the season.

Eligible to be activated off of injured reserve soon, Breaux suffered a setback in practice as he attempts to return from a fractured fibula, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Saturday, per a source. As a result, Breaux may not play at all this year. His recovery time is expected to be three to six weeks, but Breaux would have to be designated to return from IR within the next 21 days.

This would be a massive setback for the ascendant corner, who was originally slated to miss only four to six weeks. Breaux's injury was originally diagnosed as a contusion in August before he got a second opinion; two team orthopedists were promptly fired. Breaux missed 10 games last season with shoulder and leg injuries. The corner is an unrestricted free agent in 2018.

In years past, the season-long absence of the third-year corner would have been a fatal blow. But this Saints defense is different. Led by rookie sensation Marshon Lattimore, New Orleans is now a middle-of-the-road to above-average defense by all metrics. Since Week 3, the Saints are allowing the fewest passing yards per game and the third-fewest points per game.

New Orleans will sorely miss Breaux, but for the first time in a long time, the Saints can march on with competent reinforcements."

Big Blue placed Weston Richburg on injured reserve. Richburg suffered a concussion in Week 4 and had not played since. In a corresponding move, the Giants signed defensive back Tim Scott off their practice squad.

Drafted in the second round in 2014 out of Colorado State, Richburg is an unrestricted free agent at the end of this season.

Without Richburg and injured guard Justin Pugh, the Giants will be down two starting offensive linemen against Aaron Donald and the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. Brett Jones will start once more at center, while tackle Bobby Hart will fill in for Pugh.

It's another season-ending injury for a Giants team that has seen its excessive share of losses. Odell Beckham, Brandon Marshall and Dwayne Harris's consecutive injuries in New York's Week 5 loss to the Chargers have hamstrung the offense. Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie have both been subject to team-mandated suspensions. Plus, the Giants are going to Sunday's contest with two linebackers (B.J. Goodson and Jonathan Casillas) and arguably their top pass rusher (Olivier Vernon).

The injury list is piling up in East Rutherford, where it's getting late early for the 1-6 Giants."
Jeremy Bergman,"The book is out on Jacksonville, and the Cincinnati Bengals have studied it ahead of their Week 9 clash in North Florida. Why does Vontaze Burfict want the ball in Blake Bortles' hands?",2017-11-04T14:15:00Z,nfl-news,Bengals' strategy vs. Jags? 'Let Blake throw the ball',http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000871674/article/bengals-strategy-vs-jags-let-blake-throw-the-ball,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/04/0ap3000000871675_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"The book is out on Jacksonville, and the Cincinnati Bengals have studied it ahead of their Week 9 clash in North Florida.

Run. Run. Run. Jacksonville hasn't fooled anyone with their game plan all year, but they haven't tried to from the start. Jags coach Doug Marrone said in July that he wanted ""to run the ball every play"" and effectively ""change the game"" in the process. So far, so good.

Behind Leonard Fournette's boffo rookie campaign, the Jaguars lead the league in rushing by over 100 yards (1,183), are the only team to average at least five yards per rush and pace all teams with a 53.1 percent run-play percentage. (That last number is just under 60 percent in home games.)

The downside to this run-first, run-only strategy is that it's now easier in a sense for teams to prepare for the Jags on a weekly basis. It doesn't help that their quarterback play has continued to be sub-standard with Blake Bortles under center. Cincinnati plans to take advantage of Jackonville's signal-caller woes on Sunday afternoon.

""We're not going to let the run game beat us,"" Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict told the Cincinnati Enquirer this week. ""We're going to at least let Blake throw the ball. ... I think the film tells for itself that obviously Fournette can beat you and I'm not sure Blake can beat us. We want to put it in his hands and have him beat us, if he can.""

Bortles went into the bye with arguably his two best games of the season, completing 67.2 percent of his passes, throwing 571 yards and two touchdowns over two weeks, a loss to the Rams and a blowout win in Indy. Interestingly enough, Bortles' 330-yard outing against the Colts came without Fournette in the lineup.

But with a healthy Fournette back in the fold against a Cincy defense that has allowed over 100 yards on the ground in their two games since the bye week, the Jags still have the advantage on offense, regardless of how Bortles plays. The onus is on Burfict and company to stack the box, stop the run and deal with the Bortles threat if and when it surfaces."
Jeremy Bergman,The injury-riddled Washington Redskins are getting some relief in the secondary.

Veteran safety DeAngelo Hall was activated off the physically unable to perform (PUP) list Friday night. In a corresponding move, offensive lineman Orlando Franklin was waived.

The 33-year-old safety hasn't played since Week 3 of last year when he suffered a season-ending ACL tear and landed on injured reserve.

While he admitted to reporters this week that he's still ""a little behind"" in first-year defensive coordinator Greg Manusky's scheme, Hall was confident that his transition to game speed will be smooth.

""It's like riding a bike. Some things are going to be a little rusty, but for the most part it's still football,"" Hall said Friday, per the team's site. ""I've been still trying to train my eyes, get back there with the coaches as much as possible and just kind of see what they're seeing, talk to the guys and see what they're seeing, see how I probably would've played it and kind of how I see it. We do a lot of dialogue back and forth.""

Hall's return couldn't come at a better time for Washington, who have listed four players as out -- including starting tight end Jordan Reed (hamstring) -- and three offensive linemen as doubtful for its Week 9 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. In the secondary, rookie safety Montae Nicholson, who has filled in nicely for Hall, is questionable to two shoulder injuries.

The active league leader in interceptions, Hall could slide right in for Nicholson, if the first-year safety can't go, and join D.J. Swearinger in frustrating Jimmy Graham and the soaring Seahawks air attack.

In other physically able to perform news, the Kansas City Chiefs activated linebacker Tampa Hali off of PUP and onto the 53-man roster ahead of Sunday's matchup with the Dallas Cowboys. Hali had been sidelined with knee injuries, but is joining the roster right on time, as Dee Ford and Justin Houston have both been hampered by injuries. Hali has a good chance to play on Sunday."
Austin Knoblauch,Don't ask Aaron Rodgers when he'll return from the broken collarbone that has derailed his 2017 season. His message to anyone who'll listen? Check back in about six weeks.,2017-11-03T23:08:00Z,nfl-news,"Aaron Rodgers focusing on his health, not return date",http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000871634/article/aaron-rodgers-focusing-on-his-health-not-return-date,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/03/0ap3000000871607_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Don't ask Aaron Rodgers when he'll return from the broken collarbone that has derailed his 2017 season.

Speaking to reporters Friday, the Packers quarterback wasn't about to make foolhardy prognostications about whether or not he'll be back to spearhead a potential Green Bay playoff run.

His message to anyone who'll listen? Check back in about six weeks.

""It's going to come down to the bone healing. That's the most important thing,"" Rodgers said, per the team's official website. ""There won't be a decision made until that bone is healed, so it's not even a conversation if it's not where it needs to be,"" Rodgers told reporters Friday.

Rodgers suffered the broken collarbone during the Packers' Week 6 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. He was placed on injured reserve Oct. 20, meaning the earliest he could come back would be Dec. 17 against the Carolina Panthers. A lot of healing still needs to happen before Rodgers is back under center.

How the Packers play over the next five weeks is another big factor in determining whether Rodgers will return this season. At 4-3, the Packers are very much in the NFC North title chase, but will they still be there in December? Brett Hundley's performance against the New Orleans Saints did little to instill confidence in the Packers' playoff aspirations, and a potential mid-December return for Rodgers might be too late for him to make a difference -- and not worth the risk.

For Rodgers, where the Packers might be in the standings by then isn't his concern. His focus remains on doing everything he can to get healthy as soon as possible.

""It will be the bone healing. But there's a timetable,"" Rodgers said. ""I believe I can practice in six weeks based on the schedule. So if I'm at a place at that point healing-wise and [able] to throw, then I'll be out here. And if I'm not, I won't.""

As for the hit that put him on IR, Rodgers appeared to be over what happened on field between him and Minnesota Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr.

""It was deemed a legal hit, and you know that you don't have the same protection outside the pocket,"" Rodgers said, per ESPN's Rob Demovsky. ""A simple shove-down probably would have sufficed in that situation, but it is what it is."""

What to Watch For

Facing a Panthers defense that excels at stuffing the run, the Falcons need Matt Ryan to snap out of his season-long malaise. Will Atlanta finally funnel the offense through Julio Jones? The All-Pro receiver is on pace for one of the worst seasons of his career -- 85 catches, 1,234 receiving yards, two TDs. Jones has been a fighter jet lost at sea much of the season, earning only one 100-yard game and 10-plus targets in only two of seven matchups (for reference, he had 10-plus targets in 18 of 30 games from 2015-16). Matching up against Panthers corner James Bradberry is no picnic, but the Falcons need to rely on Jones on Sunday to keep pace in the NFC South.

What will life be like for Cam Newton the rest of this season without Kelvin Benjamin? Carolina traded away their top target on Tuesday. When ex-GM Dave Gettleman surrounded Newton with Benjamin and Devin Funchess the rationale was to give the QB big targets who can corral Cam's frequent high throws. The Panthers' party line for Tuesday's jettisoning of Benjamin was to get more speed on the field in hopes to open up a putrid run game. Newton will now be throwing to Funchess, Russell Shepard, and rookie Curtis Samuel as his receivers. Samuel appears to be the key but has just seven receptions on the season. Christian McCaffrey will continue to play a huge role in the passing game, but where will Newton go when he needs a big play, especially in the red zone where Benjamin thrived? Sunday's division tilt will hopefully provide some answers as to how OC Mike Shula plans to solve the riddle.

NFL Research stat of the week: Both Cam Newton (in 2016) and Matt Ryan (in 2017) followed up their MVP campaigns by posting the NFL's biggest drop-off in passer rating the following year: Newton: 99.4 to 75.8 (-23.6); Ryan: 117.1 to 92.3 (-24.8).

Let's start with the brutal ACL injury to Deshaun Watson that wiped out the rest of the season for one of the most entertaining football players on the planet. Going from Watson to Tom Savage is like being transported from an adrenaline-pumping rave to an 18th-century tea party. Bill O'Brien benched Savage after two quarters this season because the pocket-statue took six sacks and lost two fumbles in one half. Behind a still-struggling offensive line, the Texans offense must completely change to compensate for Savage under center. On the plus side, the Texans face a Colts defense that is among the worst in the NFL, including a pass D ranked 31st in the NFL, allowing 290.4 pass YPG.

On to the other team that is in a QB quagmire. The Colts announced this week that Andrew Luck is done for the season. At least Indy has been breaking in a young quarterback the past several weeks, albeit to mixed results. Jacoby Brissett has shown spurts of impressive play, owns a big arm and elusiveness outside the pocket. However, the second-year quarterback tends to hold the ball too long, suffers from stretches of inaccuracy in the pocket, and is still growing on a decision-making level. Sunday, he faces a Texans secondary that has repeatedly been scorched this season. It's time for T.Y. Hilton to make a play or three. The speedy wideout hasn't caught more than two passes or gone for more than 27 yards in any of the past three contests. If Hilton wants to be known as more than a Luck byproduct, he must start starring for his young quarterback.

NFL Research stat of the week: What did the Texans lose after Deshaun Watson's injury? Oh, just a QB who was on pace to throw 43 passing touchdowns this season, which would have been 17 more than any other rookie in NFL history.

Andy Dalton has been under siege this season behind a faltering offensive line, and facing Sacksonville provides no reprieve. The Jags bring wave after wave of pass rushers, and Dalton historically collapses under such pressure. Teams have successfully combated Jacksonville's pass rush by going to the ground, which could set up for a big day Joe Mixon, who has yet to receive 20 carries in one game. Will the Jags trade for Marcell Dareus pay immediate dividends and plug the gaps up the middle? On the outside, A.J. Green faces off against A.J. Bouye and Jalen Ramsey. Green is fourth in the NFL with 572 receiving yards this season but is coming off back-to-back sub-par weeks with fewer than four catches and 50 yards each game. Meanwhile, Bouye and Ramsey are among the top five in passer rating against this season. Dalton won't be able to avoid the duo all game. If Green doesn't win one-on-one battles Sunday, we could see a pick-barrage in Jacksonville.

Following the bye week, Jacksonville gets its offensive engine back. Leonard Fournette returns after missing Week 7 with an ankle injury. The rookie leads the NFL in rushing YPG (99.3) this season and is averaging 21.7 carries per game -- would be most by a rookie since Julius Jones in 2004 (24.6). The bulldozing Fournette key's a run-first, run-always, run-till-your-down-big offense by keeping Blake Bortles on schedule and busting out a few big runs. The Bengals defense will do everything to bottle up Fournette and force Bortles to beat a good secondary. Cincy ranks in the top-10 against the run, according to Football Outsider's metrics, and is led by hard-hitting linebacker Vontaze Burfict. The collisions between Burfict and Fournette could be epic.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Jaguars have played only one game decided by single digits this season (fewest in NFL): Wins by 22, 37, 21, and 27 points (all by 20-plus points). Losses by 21, 3, and 10 points (2 of 3 by double digits).

Is this the week Dirk Koetter pounds the ball with Doug Martin? The running back was the Bucs best offensive player last week, dashing for 71 yards on 18 carries against a very good run D, but too many negative runs behind a porous offensive line put the offense in a bind. Facing a Saints run D that is rated 29th by Football Outsiders, Martin should find more room to scamper Sunday at the Superdome. Getting the ground game going early would take pressure off Jameis Winston and keep Drew Brees on the sideline. I'm also excited to watch the matchup between Mike Evans and rookie corner Marshon Lattimore. The first-year DB has been ridiculously good of late, allowing a 22.5 passer rating since Week 3 (1st in NFL, min. 20 targets). Evans has won his share of matchups against physical corners in the past, which makes this one of the best WR-CB battles of the weekend.

The Saints have ridden Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara to great success during their five-game winning streak, but Sunday the biggest advantage lies in Michael Thomas and Drew Brees. The Bucs pass defense is among the worst in the NFL, owning the 32nd placement in Football Outsiders' DVOA. Injuries have played a part, but Tampa has been burned deep even when all their top defensive backs have been on the field. The Saints tandem of Thomas and Ted Ginn Jr. have destroyed defenses on run-after-catch passes this season and should find seams over the middle. After two horrific fumbles last week, it will be interesting to see if Sean Payton goes back to Ingram if the Saints are trying to salt away the clock with a lead.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Saints are rushing the ball on 43.5 percent of offensive plays, the highest percentage for Saints since 2009 season (45.3) -- 2009 Saints won Super Bowl XLIV.

The Rams and Giants are like two ships passing in the night. One is a party boat boasting a hot-shot coach, his young, improving signal caller, and a pro bowl running back. The other is an old tugboat with a leader trying to prevent a mutiny, a grizzled quarterback who can't do it on his own, and a skeleton crew barely able keep things afloat.

The Rams are averaging 30-plus points per game for the first time since 2001 on the back of Todd Gurley and an improved Jared Goff. Goff's passer rating increase of 26.7 from 2016 to 2017 is the biggest improvement among any QB (min. 100 attempts in each season). Both Goff and Gurley have an advantage over a Giants defense that is mediocre versus both the run and pass. With the Giants' best cornerback, Janoris Jenkins, suspended by the team this week, we'll see if Sammy Watkins breaks out of a slumber. Over the past four games, Watkins has combined for five catches and 50 yards.

Where does Eli Manning turn on offense? In Week 7, the Giants had a season-low 177 yards of total offense. For the season, Big Blue ranks 30th in points per game (16.0), and 27th in total yards per game (296.4). Facing Wade Phillips' defense holds no on-paper advantage for Ben McAdoo's offense. Getting Sterling Shepard (ankle) back is a plus. Evan Engram continues to be Manning's best option on offense but faces an L.A. D that has given up the second-fewest yards to tight ends this season.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Rams are one of two teams to surpass their 2016 win total in 2017: 5-2 in 2017, 4-12 in 2016 -- Jaguars: 4-3 in 2017, 3-13 in 2016.

The Giants are one of two teams to surpass their 2016 loss total in 2017: 1-6 in 2017, 11-5 in 2016 -- Raiders: 3-5 in 2017, 12-4 in 2016.

The Broncos are going back to Brock. Peyton Manning's former backup returns as a starter behind a porous offensive line that got Trevor Siemian pulverized. It will be interesting to see if Osweiler, a statuesque quarterback, will be able to handle the pressure supplied by Fletcher Cox, Brandon Graham, Derek Barnett, etc. The Eagles lead the NFL in QB hits this season. If Brock doesn't get the ball out quick, he could be broken in half in Philly. Emmanuel Sanders' potential return would be a big boon for the quarterback. If Osweiler gets time to throw he could find some space. The Eagles' back end has given up big plays this season, allowing 256.8 pass YPG (26th in NFL).

The Eagles traded for Jay Ajayi this week but will likely bring the running back along slowly. The matchup to watch is Carson Wentz versus the Broncos' ""No Fly Zone."" The MVP candidate has been a marvel this season, leading the NFL with 19 passing TDs and averaging 7.9 air yards per completion, but he's had his ups and downs. Sunday's game against Chris Harris, Aqib Talib et al. will be Wentz' stiffest test of the season. Wentz has shown fearlessness passing into tight windows. He'll have to do so again Sunday against Denver. The Broncos defense got picked apart by tight end Travis Kelce last week, so expect Wentz to look towards his BFF Zach Ertz often.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Broncos pass rush has generated pressure on just 6.5 percent of pass plays this season (worst rate in NFL) -- 17 sacks through first seven games (2.4 sacks/game, T-13th in NFL). Von Miller leads the team in sacks this season (7.0). No other DEN player has more than three sacks this season (Barrett, 3.0).

Alex Collins took ahold of the lead-back role in Baltimore's offense last week, pulverizing his way for 113 yards. Collins leads the NFL with 6.0 yards/carry this season (among 49 rushing qualifiers). Even with Joe Flacco not missing a start after being knocked out last week, the Ravens should lean on Collins, against a solid Titans defensive front ranked in the top-10 versus the run. When the Ravens run game is churning out yards, it opens up the play action for Flacco, and the Tennessee secondary has been lit up this season. Ideally, Baltimore's offense will get back to what Flacco runs best: a grinding ground game complemented by a few deep shots mixed in to stretch the defense.

Since returning from a hamstring injury, Marcus Mariota has not looked his sharpest, especially as a runner, logging just four rushing yards per game over the last two tilts, after opening the season with a 29.0 average. Did the bye week do enough to heal the hammy so the speedy runner can be unleashed? The Titans run struggles have coincided with Mariota's restriction. When there is no threat of the QB scampering, everything becomes restricted for Tennessee's offense. With Baltimore boasting one of the top passing defenses in the NFL, the Titans need DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry to plow through the Ravens' front in order to stay atop the AFC South.

NFL Research stat of the week: Marcus Mariota and the Titans offense have not been able to match their red zone success from a season ago:

TEN in 2017: 41.2 percent red zone TD efficiency (31st in NFL)

TEN in 2016: 72.0 percent red zone TD efficiency (best in NFL)

With Drew Stanton starting under center, the Cardinals will ride Adrian Peterson. With Carson Palmer at quarterback, the Cards average 38.5 run plays per game, but that number rises to 44.2 in Stanton's nine career starts with the Cardinals. Against a 49ers defense that hasn't stopped so much as a teenage pillow fight this season, Peterson should be able to plow his way for chunk gains Sunday. All Day galloped for 134 yards in his first start with Arizona, averaging 5.2 yards per carry. He was slowed in his second, going for 21 yards and 1.9 yards per tote. Which performance is the outlier and which closer to the real deal?

C.J. Beathard gets perhaps one last chance to lead the 49ers in his rookie campaign. Sadly, the quarterback is being tossed into harm's way without his blindside blocker, Joe Staley (orbital fracture), and his top target Pierre Garcon (neck; IR). Behind a banged-up O-line with minimal receiving targets it will likely be difficult for Beathard to take advantage of the Cardinals biggest weakness: Corners not named Patrick Peterson. If the 49ers' offense puts up a paltry showing Sunday, it could give the team brass more reason to hold out new QB Jimmy Garoppolo at least a few additional weeks.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Cardinals are now the only team in the NFL without their leading passer (Palmer) and leading rusher (David Johnson) from 2016.

The ship is sinking beneath Kirk Cousins' feet. The quarterback was pulverized last week behind an offensive line that allowed four sacks and eight QB hits. The outlook doesn't look any better against Seattle's defensive front. Trent Williams is doubtful to play, guard Shawn Lauvao is out, and guard Brandon Scherff is also questionable. With Jordan Reed out and the receiving corps not helping out Cousins at all, it will again be the Chris Thompson-show this week. The only consistent playmaker for Washington leads the team in rushing yards (231) and receiving yards (442) this season. With Earl Thomas out, at least Cousins could get some reprieve down the seam on versus Seattle. The Seahawks have allowed a 96.2 passer rating sans Thomas the past two years while surrendering a 77.6 rating with the rangy safety.

Will the acquisition of Duane Brown offer immediate dividends for a heretofore disastrous offensive line? Russell Wilson has been sacked 221 times since entering the NFL in 2012 (most in the league). Wilson has also taken the most QB hits since 2012 (511). The All-World quarterback performs magic each week to keep from getting pulverized. Wilson makes plays even CGI artists couldn't conjure. Will adding Brown take pressure off Wilson? Will the left tackle also help improve a running game that can't pick up 10 yards? The Seahawks plan to ride Eddie Lacy more this week, but if the blocking doesn't improve that experiment won't last more than a half.

NFL Research stat of the week: Russell Wilson has 300-plus pass yards and 3-plus passing TDs in each of his last two games. It's the first back-to-back 300-yard games of his career. Most passing yards (786) and passing TD (7) in the NFL in last two weeks.

Who is in for a shootout in Dallas? The Chiefs and Cowboys each boast one of the top offenses in the NFL, while the defenses struggle to get needed stops.

Let's begin in K.C. where Alex Smith has led a big-play barrage, leading the NFL in pass yards per attempt (8.4) and passer rating (115.4) this season. The threat of the deep ball should help open up the running game for Kareem Hunt, who has been stymied versus superior run defenses the past few weeks. Hunt is the only player with over 1,000 scrimmage yards this season but has been held under 50 yards rushing two of the past three weeks. The Cowboys run defense ranks 30th in the NFL, according to Football Outsiders' DVOA. Dallas has been much better with Sean Lee in the lineup, but it's a defense Hunt could run over Sunday.

Ezekiel Elliott is back in action. It takes a law degree to keep up with the legal maneuverings, but for our purposes, it's only important that Zeke will play Sunday. And boy does the running back have the matchup to produce big numbers. Elliott has looked spectacular in recent games. Since Week 4, Elliott leads NFL in scrimmage YPG (161.0), scrimmage TDs (7) and rush TD (5). He's back to hitting the hole hard and plowing through runners on the second level. Sunday, he faces a Chiefs defense that has been a sieve since Eric Berry left the lineup in Week 1. K.C.'s defense has allowed 131.1 rushing yards per game and 5.99 yards per play. The Chiefs have given up chunk plays both on the ground and through the air, allowing 71 big plays this season, most in the NFL.

NFL Research stat of the week: Alex Smith has the most passing TD (16) without an INT in his team's first 8 games in the Super Bowl Era. Smith has 259 pass attempts this season without an INT -- dating back to 1991, Bernie Kosar has thrown the most passes without an INT to start a season (286 in 1991 -- finished season with 9 INT).

After hearing criticism all week about the lack of deep shots last game, I expect Derek Carr to toss more than a few bombs against a Miami's leaky secondary. If Josh McCown and Joe Flacco can burn the Dolphins deep, Carr should too. The Raiders' quarterback owns a 51.6 passer rating on throws of 21-plus air yards (28th in NFL) this season after putting up a 117.8 rating last season. Amari Cooper will be the key for Carr. The wideout went back into a shell last week. If the Raiders are to salvage the season, Cooper needs to have another big game under the Sunday night lights.

Jay Cutler returns, and the Dolphins move on without Jay Ajayi. It will be interesting to see how Adam Gase juggles a backfield of Kenyan Drake and Damien Williams. Ajayi accounted for 82.1 percent of the Dolphins carries this season, the highest rate in the NFL. With the bruising back gone, Miami could be a pass-centric attack with Drake and Williams out of the backfield. Cutler has struggled this season, but last week showed it's not all on him. Facing a Raiders defense that ranks dead last in passer rating allowed (108.2), Cutler has an advantage if his offensive line can block Khalil Mack for more than two seconds.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Raiders are the only team this season without an interception -- first team in NFL history with 0 INTs in the first eight games of a season. Jay Cutler has thrown five INTs in six starts this year.

Matthew Stafford moved the ball at will last week, but the Lions red zone struggles hit DEFCON 1. The Lions rank T-25th in red zone offense this season, scoring touchdowns on 45.0 percent of RZ drives. Since Week 3, Detroit has converted only 31.3 percent of their red zone drives into touchdowns (30th in NFL). While the lack of a run game exacerbates matters, so does the lack of a true red-zone receiving threat. Stafford has completed only 39.5 percent of this throws in the red zone this season (30th in NFL). The Packers rank 30th in touchdowns per red zone appearance this season, according to Football Outsiders.

Did the bye week help Mike McCarthy scheme up beneficial scenarios for Brett Hundley? The Packers' passer owns the NFL's lowest yards per attempt, passing yards, passing touchdowns, and passer rating this season among players with 50-plus pass attempts. In his past two games combined, Hundley earned 244 total yards passing. The QB has too many weapons for such piddling numbers. The Lions defense did a good job slowing Le'Veon Bell last week, and if Aaron Jones is stymied Monday night, it will put the game in Hundley's hands. Can the 24-year-old quarterback earn his breakout performance in a pivotal divisional home game to keep his team's playoff hopes alive?

NFL Research stat of the week: The Packers offense has scored on 42 percent of its drives with Aaron Rodgers under center this season, and only 24 percent of its drives with Brett Hundley.

Teams on bye: Chicago Bears, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Chargers, Minnesota Vikings, New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers"

The Miami Dolphins linebacker was fined $9,115 by the NFL for his hit that left Flacco concussed during the first half of the Ravens' 40-0 win on Oct. 27, a league spokesman told NFL Network's Tom Pelissero. Flacco also suffered a cut on his ear that required stitches.

After the game, Alonso told reporters he wasn't trying to hurt Flacco.

""It was bang, bang,"" Alonso said. ""It got to a point where I thought maybe if he slid a second sooner, I was anticipating him sliding and I was going to not hit him, but I think it was like, you know, a second late, which is why I hit him.""

Flacco is officially questionable to play Sunday against the Tennessee Titans, but he cleared concussion protocol Wednesday and said he was good to go for the game.

Here are some other notable fines stemming from Week 8 games:

1. Carolina Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis was fined $48,620 for his helmet-to-helmet hit on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first half of Sunday's game, Pelissero reported. Davis was fined nearly $50K because he's considered a repeat offender.

2. Detroit Lions defensive back Quandre Diggs was fined $24,309 for his helmet hit on Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Jesse James, per Pelissero."
Around The NFL staff,Safety Earl Thomas has been ruled out for the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday due to a nagging hamstring injury.

A hamstring injury will keep Seattle Seahawks safety Earl Thomas from playing Sunday against the Washington Redskins. He was officially ruled out by the team Friday.

""It's been a hard week for him, not able to do much,"" Carroll said on KIRO-AM in Seattle on Friday morning.

While Carroll was hopeful the Seahawks' star safety can show enough improvement from a hamstring injury he suffered trying to chase down DeAndre Hopkins in last week's win over the Houston Texans, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported earlier this week that Thomas always was a long shot to play this week.

Carroll said safety Bradley McDougald will replace Thomas.

Carroll announced running back C.J. Prosise (ankle) is a game-time decision as well. He is officially questionable.

Here's a look at the other injuries we're tracking on this Friday in Week 9 of the 2017 season:

1. Buffalo Bills running back and special teamer Taiwan Jones is out for the season with a broken arm, coach Sean McDermott announced. The coach also said tight end Charles Clay (knee) and cornerback E.J. Gaines (hamstring) ""have made tremendous progress.""

2. The Houston Texans placed quarterback Deshaun Watson on injured reserve a day after he suffered a torn ACL in practice. He is out for the remainder of the season. Tight end C.J. Fiedorowicz (concussion) will be ready to play in Week 10, coach Bill O'Brien said. Cornerback Johnathan Joseph (shin/quad) is listed as questionable.

3. Oakland Raiders offensive lineman Gabe Jackson (ankle) and safety Karl Joseph (groin) are questionable for their game against the Miami Dolphins, the team announced.

4. Carolina Panthers offensive lineman Trai Turner (knee) and running back Fozzy Whittaker (ankle) are questionable for their game against the Atlanta Falcons.

5. Cincinnati Bengals kicker Randy Bullock (back) is listed as questionable, but the team believes he'll play Sunday, Rapoport reported. As a precaution, Cincy signed kicker Marshall Koehn on Saturday.

6. Jacksonville Jaguars left tackle Cam Robinson (ankle), wide receiver Marqise Lee (knee) and right guard A.J. Cann (triceps) were all listed as questionable for their game against the Bengals.

7. Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby (ankle) and tight end Zach Ertz (hamstring) are listed as questionable for their game against the Denver Broncos. Coach Doug Pederson said Friday that Ertz would play, however.

8. Broncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders (ankle), linebacker Todd Davis (ankle) and guard Ron Leary (elbow) are listed as questionable. Offensive lineman Donald Stephenson (calf) is listed as out.

9. The Green Bay Packers activated rookie linebacker Vince Biegel (foot) off the physically unable to perform list, Rapoport reported.

16. The San Francisco 49ers ruled out offensive tackle Joe Staley (fractured orbital bone) for Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals. The team officially placed wideout Pierre Garcon (neck) on injured reserve on Saturday and activated defensive lineman Ronald Blair III.

17. Miami Dolphins quarterback Jay Cutler (ribs) is expected to play in Sunday's game vs. the Raiders.

The quarterback eventually made it back to the field and became one of the most promising young quarterbacks in the NFL.

Watson tore an ACL again during practice Thursday and was placed on injured reserve Friday. And, just as he did before, the Houston Texans rookie said he's confident he can make it back to the field and be successful.

""They say you never miss it until it's gone and even though it's not gone for long, I already miss it,"" Watson said in a statement posted to Twitter on Friday. ""Yesterday, I felt like I let my teammates, my fans and my family down. However, as a child of God, I understand that everything happens for a reason. He DON'T make mistakes!

""Today, the journey back seems far but I've been here before and will conquer it once again. I want to thank each and every one of my teammates for their unwavering support. My NFL brothers, thanks for all the prayers. To my fans, I cannot begin to express my gratitude for your relentless encouragement. To the countless others who have reach out, I am humbled and can only say thank you from the depths of my heart. I play this game for you all, and I am grateful for the love you have shown me, not only over the past 24 hours, but throughout this entire season.

""I promise that I will continue to work diligently so that this team can one day bring a championship to Houston, and when I return, I will be better, stronger and more focused than ever before! Now the grind begins.... #815 #Memo GODSPEED. A small thing to a GIANT.""

The blow is obviously a huge one for the Texans. Despite their 3-4 record, the team had shown serious signs of threatening the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans for the top spot in the AFC South, all largely because of Watson's stellar play.

Without Watson, who coach Bill O'Brien said Friday ""will be one of the top quarterbacks in this league for a long time to come,"" hope for a successful year from the fanbase in Houston has waned. Per O'Brien, however, losing the rookie quarterback for the season does not mean the Texans' year is over.

""We're not going to give in to what's out there,"" O'Brien said. ""That the demise of the Houston Texans is upon us. I mean, like, that's ridiculous. We're going to show up and fight and play.""

The Texans will go with Tom Savage as their starter Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts with the newly signed T.J. Yates backing him up. While O'Brien ceded there are ""obvious"" differences between those two and Watson, he declined to get into how the Texans will change in terms of X's and O's.

So what will the Watson-less Texans look like Sunday and how will the team rebound?

""I guess we'll all find out on Sunday,"" O'Brien said."
Michael McWhertor,And what Blizzard’s doing to welcome new and lapsed players,2017-11-04T22:47:55Z,polygon,Why StarCraft 2 is going free-to-play,https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/4/16607330/starcraft-2-free-to-play-details-blizzcon-2017,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qq7wSEeHQisJTnehpO1g4hFu4bc=/0x98:1920x1103/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9608865/PartandParcel_Boss2.JPG,gaming,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"More than seven years after the launch of StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty, Blizzard Entertainment is making the real-time strategy game free-to-play. The developer announced its plans to release the game and its first campaign for free at BlizzCon 2017 this week, a move that will open StarCraft 2 up to a broader audience.

Blizzard’s Tim Morten, production director on StarCraft 2, said conversations about moving to a free-to-play model have been happening for a while, but that it was important to make the change palatable to new and existing players.

“Some of the early triggers of considering free-to-play were feedback that even though a lot of the game already was free through the starter edition, that that wasn’t well-known,” Morten told Polygon in an interview at BlizzCon, “[and] that it was confusing to understand what you need to buy to actually start playing Starcraft 2.

“We wanted to cut through that confusion and announce that StarCraft 2 is free-to-play.”

Morten said that StarCraft 2’s legacy of being an esport was another factor, and making the game free-to-play would make the game accessible to new competitors. That feedback also came from Blizzard’s esports partners, who would understandably want to see some fresh blood playing StarCraft 2.

Blizzard has been receiving that kind of input from players and partners “almost incidentally since the launch of StarCraft 2: Legacy of the Void,” the game’s second expansion, Morten said. Since then, Blizzard has added what Morten called “a lot of microcontent”: unit skins, co-op commanders and the Nova Covert Ops missions.

“We now have a catalog of content for people ... if they came in from free-to-play,” Morten said, and that Blizzard wanted to stay away from secondary currencies, grinding and other annoying monetization methods.

Of course, new players who get the game for free can also purchase the other two campaigns: Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void. They’re priced at $14.99 each.

The transition from a paid, boxed retail product to a free-to-play game isn’t just flipping a switch. Morten said the StarCraft 2 team has been working on ways to make the game approachable to new and lapsed players.

“We spent a lot of time thinking about the right way to do this,” Morten said. “It was very important to us that this be accomplished in a way that feels good to our current player base and also attractive to new players or lapsed players who haven’t played since Wings of Liberty.”

Morten stressed that Blizzard isn’t adding any secondary currencies or additional microtransactions to StarCraft 2 in order to support the game’s new free-to-play model.

“We’re just taking existing content that used to cost money and making it available for free,” Morten said. That includes free access to the Wings of Liberty campaign (or Heart of the Swarm if players already own Wings of Liberty), cooperative mode and competitive multiplayer. Players who get StarCraft 2 for free will have access to the game’s co-op commanders up to level 5, and will be able to join in ranked multiplayer matches after they’ve achieved 10 first wins of the day.

Morten said the team is introducing a new onboarding experience that helps guide new players to the mode that makes the most sense for them, whether that’s the campaign, cooperative mode or competitive ladder matches.

The primary goal, Morten said, in making the game free-to-play was to “take what we loved as a game and make it easy to be accessed more easily by more people.”"
Ryan Gilliam,"Communities, islands, warfronts and more",2017-11-04T21:19:15Z,polygon,Five things we learned from World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth’s BlizzCon panel,https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/4/16606916/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-blizzcon-2017-panel,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L3rI22gZzmJxA62NwcUOCPoDU-s=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9608681/WoW_Battle_for_Azeroth_Warfronts_tga_jpgcopy.jpg,gaming,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"After the announcement of Battle for Azeroth, World of Warcraft’s seventh expansion, the developers hosted a few different panels at BlizzCon 2017. The “World of Warcraft — Gameplay and Systems panel” did a deep dive into several of the expansions newest features.

Here’s what we learned.

The Battle for Azerite

In World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, the planet itself is dying under the player’s feet. As Azeroth bleeds, its lifeblood is boiling out of the ground and making its way to the surface. This crystallization is called Azerite, and everybody wants some.

As we quest through Kul Tiras and Zandalar, Azerite will be our main goal. Azerite will be rewards from quest givers, island raids, warfronts, enemies and more. No matter what you’re doing, you’ll be rewarded with this new resource.

But to what end? What’s it all for?

From a narrative perspective, grabbing all of this Azerite for our factions should help us gain ground in the war against the Horde/Alliance. But for every piece of Azerite we grab, a tiny bit of its power will be absorbed into our new necklace: The Heart of Azeroth.

The Artifact replacement system adds new abilities to every piece of armor

Grid View Your necklace shares its power with your armor. Blizzard/Activision

As your power grows, you will gain more and more options. Blizzard/Activision

The goal is to create similarly useful powers in each section, so there isn’t necessarily a “best answer.” Blizzard/Activision

Once you unlock a new ability, you’ll always get a different ability choice. Blizzard/Activision

As our world dies, players will be given the Heart of Azeroth, a necklace built to harness the power of Azerite for good rather than individual faction gain. With every piece of Azerite we collect, our necklace will level up and gain new abilities. But the Heart of Azeroth doesn’t just bottle up the power it absorbs, it shares it across all of your armor pieces.

As your necklace levels up, you’ll gain new abilities on your armor pieces. This essentially works in a tier-based system. Depending on the level of your necklace and the level of your gear, you’ll be able to choose from a select set of skills on that armor. As your Heart of Azeroth levels up, more skills will become available to you.

Each of these armor pieces is also lovingly hand-crafted by a developer, so you should never run into a piece of gear that is too powerful or too weak thanks to RNG. This system results in a specialization neutral power increase as you play. As the expansion goes on and better armor is released, you’ll need more levels in your Heart of Azeroth to reap the rewards.

Islands are new, infinitely repeatable scenarios

One of the best ways to grab chunks of Azerite is to run through the new Island system. These are small, 15- to 20-minute missions where three players can group up and assault an island together. But these islands never really stay the same. While it isn’t necessarily as procedurally generated as Diablo 3, they should have dozens of different combinations.

The panel went into several different scenarios that could appear on the same landmass. You could play the same Island three times in one day and fight different enemies in different locations every time. But the locations of Azerite nodes and where you choose to fight isn’t the only thing that will change.

To add even more replayability, Blizzard has developed some extra smart adversaries to go up against.

Blizzard has created AI that plays like we do, for better or worse

As you and your squad run through the Island, three AI-controlled enemies from the other faction will be there as well. But these NPCs don’t react to combat the same way that most enemies do. Instead, they play like every jerk who’s ever ganked you while leveling.

At the panel, developers painted a picture of an AI-controlled Rogue who might run up, knock you out, steal the Azerite node you were trying to get and then run away. These AI are aggressive and make smart decisions. They don’t have spawn locations or aggro ranges, they simply act like another player.

These Islands can also be played in a PvP mode, where the enemy AI is actually replaced with real players.

Warfronts bring Warcraft 3 to WoW

One of the other new features in WoW’s seventh expansion takes inspiration from Warcraft 3, Blizzard’s beloved real-time strategy game from 2002. These Warfronts are 20-player wars against the opposing faction. But rather than simply offering a PvP experience similar to the battlegrounds that have existed for years, Warfronts are RTS-light experiences.

When the Warfront starts, players will spread out and gather resources just like in Warcraft 3. These resources can contribute toward building various structures that will spawn out AI controlled armies. The Warfront developers are even building the tech trees to emulate the original Warcraft 3 versions.

Ryan Gilliam,"Finally, a voice chat feature that people may actually use",2017-11-04T19:48:38Z,polygon,World of Warcraft’s next expansion adds Blizzard Voice Chat (update),https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/4/16606772/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-voice-chat,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sPQJWmT7wF9gaOfX5Z4UQmhyFrM=/0x0:1920x1005/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9608159/WoW_Battle_for_Azeroth_Allied_Races_Alliance.jpg,gaming,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"In a social game like World of Warcraft, players are always looking to chat in one way or another. Blizzard has offered in-game messaging for years, a beautiful cacophony of service sales and players looking for a groups. The problem has always come when players needed more instant communication.

Some guilds use Ventrilo while others play with TeamSpeak or Discord. In Battle for Azeroth, World of Warcraft’s seventh expansion, players will be able to use Blizzard’s integrated voice chat rather than downloading every voice client known to man.

While World of Warcraft first added voice chat in 2007, with the Burning Crusade expansion’s 2.2 patch, players haven’t used it much in the past 10 years. The system is hidden deep inside of WoW’s system menus and most modern players have likely never heard a group mate use it in game.

At BlizzCon 2017, World of Warcraft’s developers announced new social features coming to their game in the upcoming expansion. Guilds and communities, a new cross-server friend group, will be able to talk with their teammates without ever having minimize the game or dig into the system menu.

Instead, players will be able to use Blizzard’s new, clear-sounding in-game voice chat that released in October of last year. Additionally, players that are just planning to hop in for one quick run with a random group can opt-in to voice chat for the duration of the activity.

Update: This post has been updated to clarify that Blizzard is adding the Blizzard Voice Chat product, introduced in 2016, to World of Warcraft."
Michael McWhertor,Meet the flying feline that was too weird for Overwatch,2017-11-04T19:32:52Z,polygon,Here’s Overwatch’s canceled Jetpack Cat hero,https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/4/16606796/overwatch-jetpack-cat-blizzcon-2017,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Egb0hc7Zyat3HzHnGviqwwfTyNo=/0x57:1039x601/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9607925/jetpack_cat.png,gaming,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"It’s no secret that Blizzard has ideated hundreds of heroes for Overwatch, far more than have ultimately made it into the game. But few of those characters left on the cutting room floor have been as compelling as the character known as “Jetpack Cat.”

Game director Jeff Kaplan revealed the existence of Jetpack Cat earlier this year in an interview with GameSpot. It was an early concept that was beloved internally, he said, but recognized as “too ridiculous for Overwatch.”

At BlizzCon today, Kaplan and lead character concept artist Arnold Tsang showed off some of the earliest ideas for Overwatch, which was born from the ashes of Blizzard’s canceled MMO, Titan. Jetpack Cat was created during that time of exploration, Kaplan said, but as amusing as the concept was, it “felt like we were slipping out of the universe” they were building.

There were at least two ideas for Jetpack Cat: one a puckish cartoon cat with a heroic streak and another (perhaps more accurate) lazy version who uses his jetpack as a mobile recliner of sorts.

As it turns out, Jetpack Cat wasn’t the only flying animal Blizzard dreamt up during Overwatch’s early days. Here are some other early hero ideas.

Yes, that is a flying alligator. That hero is joined by a few other wild ideas, including a free-flying monkey with a flamethrower, a gargoyle, a four-legged simian mech and “a creepy kid with a goatee” and a flaming head.

There may be hope for Jetpack Cat and Flying Alligator to return someday, however, as Kaplan noted “these might be ideas for another game, but not Overwatch.”

Kaplan has also talked about one of the other straight-up bizarre ideas, known only as the Hockey Hero (who kind of made it into the game as a skin for Lúcio). Here’s a peek at Hockey Hero, as well as an alien creature and a hero in a full bomb suit.

Finally, here’s a look at an idea board of heroes from Overwatch’s earliest days, when Blizzard staffers were playing with about 50 ideas for characters. Some of those concepts we’ve seen before. Some are very close to their final implementation in Overwatch. There are nascent versions of Mei (Frost), Reinhardt (when he was an African warrior known as Wildebeest), Mercy (Angelica), Pharah (then known as Mercy) and others. Perhaps the most interesting early idea is that Torbjorn (Ironclad) once attacked foes with ... a bowling ball."

Full details may be found in the video above. The new characters bring each faction’s hero roster to six. The new characters are the aramusha (for the Samurai faction) and the shaman (Vikings).

They (and the rest of the content) will be available Nov. 14 for those who bought the game’s season pass, and on Nov. 21 for all players. They have to be unlocked with 15,000 Steel, For Honor’s in-game currency.

Season Four also introduces the previously announced Tribute Mode. In Tribute Mode, factions contest for one of three “Offerings,” to bring back to their base shrine to give a buff to all members of their team. Season Four also means the debut of ranked play in the Dominion mode.

More details are available in this blog post from Ubisoft.

For Honor launched in February. For more of what we think about it, see Polygon’s review."

Apparently it’s going to unlock sometime around Monday. But this YouTuber clipped right on through to take a gander at the placeholders inside.

So, this is a spoiler warning if you want to wait to open your presents whenever that comes.

Blondbassist found what appears to be a records room, and from there it looks like users will be able to access some kind of new arcade mode, and an area for watching videos and reading digital comics.

Blondbassist was able to do this with the day-one, version 1.0 edition of Wolfenstein 2, noting that the “noclip” developer console that allowed him through the locked sub door has been patched out of future iterations.

There are a bunch of in-game documents scattered on the ground to give users a diversion, as well as some kind of capsule or diving chamber with a number above it. There’s nothing inside that, yet, says Blondbassist, but who knows.

The arcade mode could be interesting, but who knows that that entails. “Combat simulations” is the only thing the placeholder card says so far. As for the comic books, Titan Comics is two books into its Wolfenstein adaptation (available through Comixology) but it’s not clear if this is the same thing or something new.

Polygon has reached out to a Blizzard representative for clarification on its plans for Overwatch. Blizzcon is underway this weekend but no announcement regarding Overwatch on Mac or any new platform has been made yet.

In May, Jeff Kaplan, the director of Overwatch, said Blizzard was “open minded to” launching on Mac but “we just sort of need the priorities of our development process to line up with the capabilities of the platform in order for it to become a reality.” (12:45 of the following video.)

Users provided these screenshots of Overwatch appearing in Battle.net on its Mac application and downloading but noting that it is not yet playable.

The ninth edition of the weeklong charity marathin begins Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018 at the Hilton Washington Dulles in Herndon, Va. After a pre-show and runs through Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and Ratchet & Claank, it moves to Splatoon 2, and an any-percent attempt by TonesBalones. Any-percent means completing the campaign, regardless of side missions, collectibles and the like.

Wall of Spain goes after a completion of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim’s main quest in under 50 minutes after that. Monday’s highlights include Sonic Mania (which launched in August) and an any-percent run with Sonic and Tails by Claris.

Tuesday packs together back-to-back runs at Castlevania (Harmony of Dissonance and Symphony of the Night) and zombies — Left 4 Dead 2 and Dying Light, spilling over midnight Wednesday into Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis and then Silent Hill for good measure.

Thursday’s spotlight is the usual weird block of Nintendo Entertainment System movie adaptations (Blues Brothers, Home Alone 2) plus a 15-minute any-percent run at Prey (the most recent game). Friday delivers crowd-pleaser Spelunky, in a solo run whose rules include all shortcuts plus beating Olmec, aiming for a 30 minute completion.

Saturday brings big names: The Legend of Zelda, Mass Effect, Diablo, Bloodborne and Final Fantasy 4, with the latter expecting to take more than two hours. The Sunday finale with Breath of the Wild begins at 1:55 a.m. and is booked for a time of 3 hours and 57 minutes.

The full schedule, with all of the runners competing, is here.

This is the ninth year of Awesome Games Done Quick, which raises money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Last year’s marathon raised $2.2 million, again setting a record (by more than $1 million over 2016’s total raised)."

But at the moment, a few days before the system’s public launch, the filter isn’t working properly.

Microsoft introduced new sorting and filtering options for the Xbox One’s My Games & Apps screen in last month’s system update. Xbox One X owners have the ability to hide all games without “Xbox One X Enhanced” updates, which is a very handy option. Microsoft generally does a much better job in the area of transparency than Sony does with the PlayStation 4 Pro, and this is just one element of that.

However, the sorting is currently leaving out some games for which Xbox One X updates have indeed been released. When we took the above screenshot last night, at least one enhanced game, Assassin’s Creed Origins, wasn’t showing up in the list. (Dishonored 2 appears to have been updated as well, although according to the Xbox website, the patch isn’t live yet.) Both games are still missing now.

Of course, this user-friendly feature isn’t very useful if the search results aren’t accurate. A Microsoft representative acknowledged the problem in a statement to Polygon, saying the company is “aware that for some users, games aren’t being filtered as Xbox One X Enhanced in ‘My games and apps.’” The spokesperson added that the Xbox team is “working to resolve the issue.”

“There needs to be love there, some emotion connecting the user to the product,” Saint John told Recode Thursday at Code Commerce in New York City. “We’ve got to get people to be in love with the product.”

That won’t come as a campaign. “You have to show it,” Saint John, formerly the head of global consumer marketing for Apple Music and iTunes, said. “I don’t think you can in an ad.”

To Saint John, building a new brand image has to happen in the background through human resources, changing company culture and hiring women and people of color.

“There has to be more of us. Hire more women. The numbers matter in this particular case,” Saint John said. “There’s no magical Wizard of Oz that’s going to fix this for us.”

To the public, she wants to change the narrative to tell Uber’s other stories.

“It’s about storytelling, about upward mobility, movement,” she said. “I want to see drivers who’ve changed their lives because of this opportunity.”

To that end, Saint John plans to drive an Uber herself.

How would Saint John prevent issues like the #DeleteUber campaign, which hurt Uber’s business earlier this year when customers perceived the brand as taking advantage of a taxi strike?

“Sometimes it can be as simple as a statement. Uber has made statements about things that as a company and a country we don’t want to stand for.”

On diversity problems in Silicon Valley:

“This is not unique to Silicon Valley, it happens in grocery stores. I’ve been a black person all my life ... It is really bad in Silicon Valley and that’s where I work.”

On why she took a job at Uber for professional reasons:

“As a marketer, a brand person can rarely come in and literally put your stamp on it and say I did that ... It’s about the total structure of a brand.”

On why she took a job at Uber for personal reasons:

“If I can go into the situation like this — the tip of the spear for what is wrong — and we can fix that thing, I know for sure this will be all right. I want to hold up the mirror and say if this place can do it, so can everyplace else. I want to feel that. I don’t want to be in a situation where I feel like I can’t produce or can’t be my whole self because of prejudices or uncomfortable situations because of who I am.”

NBA boss Adam Silver has a solution: Make sports look more like video games.

Specifically, make them look like Twitch, Amazon’s platform for live gaming, which features a blizzard of live stats and a steady stream of chatter from gamers watching the event in real time.

“I think to a lot of older consumers, used to looking at sports, it might might look incredibly cluttered,” Silver said at the Code Commerce event in New York City. But it’s the kind of presentation that could appeal to younger viewers, he said.

Silver, whose league has made a point of embracing Twitter and other digital media outlets, argued that traditional TV broadcasts of NBA games and other pro sports have been essentially unchanged for the past 30 years. It’s “almost like a silent movie,” he said.

Right now, if Silver wants to see those kinds of changes in the U.S., he will have to hope that ESPN or Turner — which own most of the digital rights for his league — innovate in the way they present their games online.

But when those deals expire, he certainly expects Facebook, Amazon and other big tech companies to use innovation in the way they present his product as part of their offer. “The best sales pitch to us is how they’re going to find new ways to engage our fans in these telecasts,” he said.

Retail has to rethink itself.

That’s the message Kirsten Green, founder of VC firm Forerunner Ventures, gave today during a presentation to Code Commerce attendees in New York City.

To illustrate the tricky situation, Green noted that 43 percent of consumers admit “owning today feels like a burden.” Additionally, 77 percent of people say social media is the main source of inspiration for the products they buy.

Green knows what she’s talking about. Her firm has had uncanny success backing e-commerce startups. It was the lead backer in Dollar Shave Club, which sold to Unilever for $1 billion, and it invested in Jet.com, which Walmart acquired for $3.3 billion.

Green noted in her presentation that mall traffic is shrinking but consumers are still buying. These are confusing stats to navigate but Green thinks there’s plenty of hope, as evidenced by the $45 billion pop-up industry, in which retailers or brands create a temporary shopping experience.

She also pointed to in-store augmented and virtual reality displays, concierge-style services and made-to-order merchandise as ways that retailers can elevate ho-hum shopping to the level of an experience.

“I certainly don’t think we’re in the midst of a retail apocalypse,” Alber said. “I do not believe that and I do not believe that Amazon is killing retailers. I believe retailers’ bad service is killing retailers. And I think because of that you might not go to the malls as much as you used to.”

For that reason, Alber said Williams-Sonoma and its separate brands — including Pottery Barn and West Elm — are continuing to innovate around its service.

“We’re very focused on improving our customer service and not just in-store but also the delivery,” she said at Recode’s Code Commerce event in New York. “We just got done with a board meeting; we measured every single piece of our delivery to the customer [and] we’re now having customers rate at us at every single point.”

“Moving large-scale furniture is difficult, which is why it’s a huge differentiator,” she said. “If you can do something hard well that’s an advantage.”

Still, Alber said the companies have experimented with new digital experiences for e-commerce.

Pottery Barn has partnered with Google on an augmented reality app that lets consumers reimagine their home with furniture from the store.

“We want to lead on these things,” she said. “We knew the Tango phone, there’s not a lot of them out there. We’re great partners with Google [and] we do a lot of things with them. But we also did it because we wanted to be ready when it came on the Apple phone. The Tango phone had the depth perception that allowed this to happen.”

Now, the company has about 140,000 3-D models built for this AR/VR experience. However, Alber concedes that there are few Tango phones out there so the current application is used mostly in stores.

“What I’m focused on is putting our application on the Apple phone,” she said.

Isaacson explains how da Vinci’s life story can inform our thinking today about innovation and technology.

You’re listening to Recode Decode, a podcast about tech and media’s key players, big ideas and how they’re changing the world we live in. You can find more episodes of Recode Decode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Play Music, or wherever you listen to podcasts, or just visit recode.net/podcasts for more.

Today in the red chair is Walter Isaacson, who I’ve interviewed many times before. He’s the author of a new biography of Leonardo da Vinci, perhaps our first and greatest inventor.

Walter Isaacson: What a great inventor.

What a great inventor, but Walter has previously written biographies of people like Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Steve Jobs — also great inventors — and is CEO of the nonprofit Aspen Institute. But that’s changing, is that ... We’ll talk about that in a bit. Walter, welcome to Recode Decode.

It’s good to be back with you, Kara.

Thank you. You are just like a machine of creating books. Your last book ...

I’ve been working on this for like 15, 20 years.

Oh, really?

It’s sort of the mountain I wanted to try to scale.

Because last time we talked, you had written about women in tech and stuff like that, and Steve Jobs before that, and obviously Franklin and Einstein. Let’s give the listeners a little background of all the books you’ve written, focused on inventors, really — on tech and inventors.

Yeah. I’ve written about a lot of smart people, Ben Franklin and Steve Jobs and Einstein, and I began to realize that smart people are kind of common. They don’t usually amount to much. You have to be inventive, as you said, innovative. You have to be creative and have imagination, and one of the things I learned from Steve Jobs, just watching him onstage, he always showed the intersection of the liberal arts street with technology street. He said, “That’s in the DNA, if you can stand at that intersection between the arts and sciences or between beauty and engineering. That’s where you’ll be the most creative.”

He really looked up to Leonardo da Vinci, and Bill Gates had just bought the Codex Leicester, which is Leonardo da Vinci’s great notebook on geology and science, and I realized that Leonardo was a person who best connected beauty to technology, best connected art and science, and so I decided that would be a combination of all these books about, “What is creativity and how do we achieve it?”

All right. So let’s talk about the books you’ve done already. You obviously are a journalist. Give a little background for yourself, because not everybody knows you.

Well, I grew up in New Orleans and worked on the paper down there.

Yeah, I hear that.

Yeah. Then, came up to Time Magazine back in the days when paper-based weekly news magazines actually were thriving.

Yeah. Some bad news for Time this week, actually.

Yeah. I know, I know. At Time Magazine, a couple of things happened. First of all, I was what was called a floater for a while. A floater means that one week, you’re writing in the medicine section, the next week you’re writing in the music section. Then, one week you’re doing business, next week you’re doing technology, then world affairs. You try to understand the patterns across nature. You don’t get siloed. You see many different disciplines.

It struck me that that’s been Franklin’s strength. He was a scientist. He did the lightning experiments, but he’s also a writer. He has “Poor Richard’s Almanac” and was a diplomat and everything, a musician. I said, “There’s some people who are great at being specialists. They’re great at geeking out, drilling down, but there are other people who see the patterns across nature.”

Now I realize, Steve Jobs was that way, even Einstein. When he gets stymied with his equations for general relativity, he pulls out his violin and plays Mozart because it helps connect him to the harmonies of the spheres. That, too, led me to Leonardo da Vinci, because everything ... he thought of himself as an engineer, and inventor, and a scientist.

At one point he’s writing a job application letter, right, when he’s reaching that very scary milestone of turning 30. He writes a job application letter to the Duke of Milan, it’s 11 paragraphs. The first 10 are all he can do in engineering, in invention. Says, “I can invent portable bridges, I can make great public buildings, I can divert water, I can make military weapons.” Only in the very last paragraph he says, “I can also paint.” So that ability to dance with nature across different fields ...

Which has been the commonality, all the people you’ve been writing about.

Commonality.

So before we get to Leonardo, because I want to talk only about Leonardo the whole time, but when you’re thinking about this idea of who you’re going to write about, can you just go through your process? Like, you say you’ve been writing this for 15 years. Tell me about that.

Well, I’ve loved Florence and used to go there as a student, and you’re always gathering string on Leonardo, and I saw some of his notebooks and I realized there was a lot of material there. But my process was, I was at Time Magazine, a close friend of mine, Evan Thomas and I were working there, and we were kind of frustrated because in the pre-internet days you’d write one page a week, and it was pretty, a little bit too easy.

We said, “Well, let’s do a book.” We did it, it was called “The Wise Men,” it was about six friends and how they created Cold War foreign policy. Not exactly a runaway bestseller, but fun to do. After I decided, “Well, I like writing books,” because in this day and age when we’re swamped with information, there’s something kind of cool about narrative, which means it starts at the beginning and goes step by step through time, and you see how people’s minds change, how they mature, how things build.

So I kind of liked writing books. I did Henry Kissinger, partly because “The Wise Men” ended with Vietnam and I wanted to try to do Vietnam. And frankly, after doing Kissinger it’s like, okay, after dealing with him I need to do somebody who’s been dead for 250 years.

You pick a lot of dead people.

Well, and Ben Franklin ...

Because Leonardo’s really dead.

Yes, well, 500 years, but he’s still alive on his notebook pages. But Ben Franklin, one reason I chose him is that at the end of Kissinger, I got to a point about realism in American foreign policy, how we sometimes do balance of power games. I realized Ben Franklin did that as a diplomat in Paris. He balanced the Bourbon-pact nations of France and Netherlands and Spain against the British alliance, in order to get the treaty that ended the Revolutionary War, but nobody writes about Franklin as a diplomat. They write about ... usually great English professors who write about him.

Then I discovered at the end of Franklin that his electricity experiments were so important. We sometimes think of him as a doddering dude flying a kite in the rain. No. The single fluid theory of electricity is an awesome discovery, and so too is the invention of the lightning rod. These are not little things we read in our childhood books and then forget about.

I realize that somebody like Franklin would have thought you a Luddite if you didn’t keep up with the latest in science. So I wanted to wrestle with science and then moved on to Einstein. Einstein, after I did Ben Franklin, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs called me and said, “Do me next.” My first reaction was, yeah, well, okay Franklin, Einstein. I said, “Let’s wait 30 or 40 years till you retire.” But then I realized that ... Because I realized that I was told he was sick, that oh, if you’re going to do it, do him now.

That was a great opportunity that most people don’t have, other than Boswell with Dr. Johnson, to get very, very close with a person who significantly made a dent in the universe. I mean, I walk here and everybody’s on their iPod and their GPS and they’re tweeting and they’re doing all these things, and they’re calling Uber or they’re getting to their Airbnb, none of which would have existed if you hadn’t had an iPhone and then third-party apps on the iPhone.

So that was truly an opportunity to try to get right the most creative and beautiful and spiritual inventor of our era. After that, because he reminded me so much of Leonardo da Vinci, and then as I say Bill Gates was interested in Leonardo da Vinci. I had been sort of 12, 15, 20 years, every now and then get somewhere and say, “Oh there’s a Leonardo da Vinci notebook here in Paris or in the British Library or Windsor or in Milan,” or it would come on tour. I realize that basing something on his notebooks could show me how the innovation, engineering and invention connected with art and the beautiful.

So you started writing it 15 years ago. Talk about that. You were collecting string or you just had been long interested in him?

I’d been long interested in him. My wife had done her junior year abroad in Florence, and what struck me as I was gathering string was — not being able to see Virgin of the Rocks at the Louvre or the one in the National Gallery in London, but actually seeing his notebooks. They’re weird because he writes in mirror script because he’s lefthanded, and paper is sort of a premium, so on any page of the notebook you see a mind that’s beautifully dancing with nature, because he’ll go from a sketch of people at a table that might help him with The Last Supper, to a set design for a play he’s doing, to a flying machine that’s both part of the play but actually might become a real flying machine, to the mathematical problem of squaring the circle, all crammed onto a page.

In fact, there’s a wonderful page I love, I have it in the book so you can see it, a spread in the book in color, because after all these little things he’s doing on that page, he writes about boiling certain types of nuts in oil, and that you can use it to dye your hair blond, Connie blond is the word. I’m thinking, oh my gosh, he’s in his early 30s ...

It’s chemistry, right?

No, it’s not just chemistry. He’s a beautiful guy, when he’s young. In fact, Vitruvian Man, the naked guy spread eagle in the circle and square, that’s largely a self portrait, that’s what he looked like. He’s drawing himself inside the earth, the universe, and seeing how we fit into creation. So he’s kind of vain. He dresses really well, in purple and wonderful tunics and stuff, and there he is figuring out how to dye his hair blond. I go, “Yes! This guy is human.”

Through the notebooks, rather, I can humanize him, as opposed to just doing like other writers on Leonardo [who] mainly start with the 12 great painting masterpieces and discuss his life. I said, “No, let me do it page by page through the notebooks.”

One other thing, looking at those notebooks, this is a tech show, we’re on a podcast, we know all sorts of forms of new media. No doubt you’ve tweeted out the podcast and it’s on Instagram and Facebook and Snap and everything.

Instantly it will be.

Paper’s not a bad technology. It is really a good technology for the storage and retrieval of information. After 500 years, we still can turn the pages of Leonardo’s notebooks. From the 1990s, Steve Jobs had some memos on a NeXT Computer in his house. Even with his tech [abilities], we couldn’t retrieve that, because the NeXT operating system no longer can retrieve the documents that well. So every now and then, one of the lessons I learned is take notes on paper in a notebook. They’ll be around 50 years for ... You’ve got two kids, for your grandchildren or great-grandchildren. They’ll be around maybe 500 years.

Or try to do nothing on paper. There’s paper right here, but it’s unusual for me.

Yeah the paper here, I know, but I just mean maybe in the evening just keep a journal of a few things.

Well, we’ll get to that in a second, the lessons of Leonardo we’ll do at the end. But let’s talk about, so you started doing it, talk about the research, and then in the next section I’d like to talk about the meat of the book. It’s an enormous book, besides being sizeable. What was your thinking, how did you want to approach, as the definitive biography of him, or what was your thinking?

It was, to me, the biography that would weave together the science of invention and art. You take Kenneth Clark, great biography, but he says — I think it was written 80 years ago or so. He says, “Oh, if Leonardo hadn’t wasted so much time on math and invention he could have finished more paintings, it’s a shame.” I’m going, “No, no, he wouldn’t have been Leonardo if he wasn’t as curious about math and science and innovation.” Martin Kemp has written great books on Leonardo, but mine are kind of more chronological. They begin with him being born and they end at the end of his life. So it’s a way to weave together in a narrative, chronological way, all the aspects of his life.

All the aspects of his life. All right, we’ll let’s talk about him, because when you mentioned this to me I think two years, whenever you were working on it, I was surprised. Then I thought, oh of course that makes perfect sense, because just the things you just talked about. Talk about, you think the key things people get wrong about Leonardo, and then we’ll get into his life and how he conducted it, especially the math and science part of it. What do you think the conception of him is and is it close to the person who you have written about?

Well, I think the key thing people get wrong, who are scholars on him or art critics, is what I said about Kenneth Clark, which is that his time spent doing engineering and math was a waste, because none of his ... the helicopter never really flew, he tried to divert the Arno river and it didn’t get diverted, and the tanks never rolled, and he never squared the circle, which is the problem he spent his whole life doodling in his notebooks on.

I feel that if you don’t have the depth and breadth of interest of Leonardo, you don’t end up painting the Mona Lisa, or for that matter discovering how the aortic valve works. That was a major discovery. He does it because he loves how water flows and swirls, which is part of his art, it’s part of the curls of the people he paints, and it’s part of his science and it’s part of his anatomy dissections. So I guess that would be, to me, the biggest misconception, is that he was just a painter.

Which I don’t think people think anymore. It’s an interesting thing, because he’s known for everything.

Yeah, you’re right.

But let’s start in this section, the painter part. Talk about his painting and then I want to mostly talk about his science and technology.

Well, one of the thing he does in art that is truly significant is what’s called sfumato, which is the blurring of the lines, as if they were like smoke, because it stems from his science. He realizes that there are no sharp lines. You’re looking at my face right now, it’s not something you can draw in lines because the light hits the curves, the curves make different shadows. But also we have two eyes with large retinas, and so any line in nature is slightly blurred. So that’s a key to his paintings. So different, say, from Michelangelo, who draws with a disegno style, sharp lines.

Secondly, his ability to project three dimensions on a two-dimensional panel or surface was a huge leap of art that was happening around that time in the Renaissance. He’s very collaborative and he learns from Brunelleschi and Alberti, but also all the painters in the studio where he’s working. But he’s able to capture the mathematics of perspective and play tricks with it, so when you look at The Last Supper, the room looks deeper than it is because it’s an accelerated perspective. Well, that’s different from the flat paintings that came along then. But you’ll notice in both those cases, I talked about how the science and the art were blended together.

And how he used that. Especially, talk about the Mona Lisa in that way.

The Mona Lisa is the culmination. This evening, we’re in Washington now, I’m going to be at the National Gallery in front of Ginevra de’ Benci, which is a early, early portrait he did of a cloth merchant’s wife in Florence. It’s a great painting, but it’s not one of the world’s greatest masterpieces, because he’s trying to connect the rivers of the earth to the body and her emotions, but they’re things that don’t quite work. Near the end of his life, in fact at the end of his life, because he takes 16 years with the Mona Lisa, he spent a lot of time with it, it’s by his deathbed when he’s still dabbling with it. It’s the same type of picture. It’s a cloth merchant’s wife, a wife named Lisa, in three quarters profile with the river flowing from the eons of time, connecting her to the spirit of the earth, just like Ginevra de’ Benci, but they’re so different, the paintings.

So a lifetime spent in dancing with nature and being curious about every aspect of nature is reflected in the Mona Lisa. I can give you one specific example which I love, which is the smile. The greatest, most memorable smile ever. There are two things he does to make that smile work. First of all, he dissects more than 30 human faces. Peeling the face off cadavers and delineating every muscle that touches the lips, why the lower lip can move separately from the upper lip but the upper lip can’t move easily separately from the lower lip. Things you and I could figure out but we don’t, he did. He looked at every nerve that touches every muscle and whether it comes from the brain or the spinal cord. On like the 15th page of his notebook where he’s drawing these dissections, there’s a faint sketch, I have it in my book, that whole page, and at the top is a faint sketch which is the first attempt at the smile of the Mona Lisa. There she is, smiling, just the lips, smiling from the page.

Secondly, he had dissected the human eye. So he knows that light that comes directly into the eye and hits the very center of the retina sees detail, but the light that hits the edges of the retina see mainly shadows. So if you look directly at the corner of the lips of the Mona Lisa, there’s a tiny part of a detail that turns down slightly. But the shadows turn upward. So it’s a smile that’s elusive. You see it best when you’re not looking for it. If you’re staring directly at her, she may not seem like she’s smiling, it’s kind of enigmatic. But when your eyes wander to her forehead or her chin or her cheek, suddenly the smile lights up. It’s an augmented reality. It’s interactive.

We first see the Mona Lisa when we’re young, and we hitchhiked ...

Yes, it’s one of those paintings.

Back when we used to hitchhike a lot in Europe, you hitchhike to Paris, you get there, and there’ll be a whole lot of tourists. Nowadays you go there and there’s 200 people and they all have their iPhones and they’re not looking at the picture, they’re all taking selfies with themselves, or pictures of the picture. But as you stare at that picture, it suddenly dawns on you, I get it. This is in a class by itself.

Right. Do you think it’s one of the greatest painting, or has it become such a tourist attraction?

No, I think that there’s a reason that it has become an icon.

Why?

Because it is the greatest painting.

It is, because it’s an AR, I had no idea it was AR.

It’s interactive, your emotions change as you look at it, and then so do hers. Not only her smile, her eyes, famous. Mona Lisa eyes, they follow you, etc. Those type of things make it so that you’re not just seeing a flat portrait, you’re seeing something that ... a person who has emotion. And all of his life in his notebooks he’s trying to say, how do our inner emotions get reflected in our outward gestures and motions? Here it is, culminating in the Mona Lisa, it’s not just a portrait, it’s a psychological drama that you and I get to interact with. Nobody has come close to painting a painting like that.

I had no idea about the technology. All right, we’re here with Walter Isaacson.

You’re a tech podcast.

I know, it’s true, but I had no idea, now I know. We’re here with Walter Isaacson, his new book is about Leonardo da Vinci, the great inventor and painter. When we get back we’re going to talk about his focus on science and technology, which was vast, and a lot of his things that he thought about creating have come to pass, we’re going to talk about his background, how he got there. He’s one of the first, I think, probably one of the first famous entrepreneurs and inventors that we learn about as kids.

[ad]

We’re here with Walter Isaacson, the prolific writer, the journalist, someone I’ve known very well. He’s a New Orleans resident now, is that right?

At least half time.

He’s a man of the world, a man of letters and science.

So let’s take apart Leonardo. We just talked about his art, which I think most people know him best for, but of late a lot of people have been talking about his inventiveness and the science around it, and you noted that Bill Gates bought some of his notebooks, his most famous notebooks.

The Codex Leicester, an awesome, awesome notebook.

Yeah. So how much did he pay for that?

I do know, but I’ve sort of forgotten. I try not to.

Lots.

It was I think somewhere between 30 and 40 million, but it wasn’t a lot. It was definitely worth it.

Yes, why did he buy that, and let’s go into the discussions about his technologies.

I think Bill Gates, not to speak for him, but has a wide-ranging interest. He just listens to Richard Feynman lectures, he loves all forms of science, but also a great humanism to him. As we see. I think he was interested in Leonardo. I once heard Bill Gates say that Leonardo was the person in history who tried to know the most about everything that could be known. That’s something that’s quite inspiring, and there’s no better example of it. We have more than 7000 pages of his notebooks, but this one, the Codex Leicester, which shows water flowing into a pond, it shows the sun, it shows how light reflects from the earth to light up the new moon. All of these wonderful dances with nature, I think that — not speaking for Bill Gates — but that’s why anybody would want that notebook.

So talk about how he got this way. Not Bill Gates, but maybe that’s another biography for later for you. You shook your head.

He writes his own books.

That’s true, but he could be written about. So talk about what made Leonardo this way. How do you become a person that is that curious?

I think he had the great good fortune to be born out of wedlock.

Oh, okay. Most people don’t think of that as great good fortune, especially now.

Well, had he been legitimate born, he would have had to be a notary like his father and grandfather and great-grandfather were. Secondly, he would have been sent to one of the classical schools in Florence for the aspiring upper-middle classes and rising middle classes, or a university, and he would have been stuffed full of the medieval scholastic learning of the time.

Which was?

Yeah, which was medieval. I mean, that’s ... And it was before the scientific revolution and the Renaissance. Instead, he’s unschooled. So he has to teach himself. He calls himself a man without letters, meaning not schooled, a person who has to teach himself, and he says that made me a disciple of experience.

So that means even as a young kid in the village of Vinci, he is looking at swirls of water, testing things, drawing how water flows and erosion happens, drawing landscapes. Then when he moves to Florence at age 12, he’s always experimenting with things, because he has to teach himself.

So who did he grow up with? He grew up with his ...

He grew up with both his father, who was a notary, who at age 12 moved him to Florence, but his mother, who for the first time this year, working with Martin Kemp and Pallanti and others, we now know who his mother was, it’s in my book, which is a 14-year-old orphaned peasant girl from the village of Vinci. She also helped raise him, so he had a good-enough childhood. Being born out of wedlock was not ... Even popes around that time had lots of out-of-wedlock children.

So it wasn’t as bad.

In fact, it was once, Jacob Burckhardt, one of the 19th century historians, calls it a golden age for bastards because it actually liberated you from going into whatever the family business was and you got to become an artist, a poet, a gold-beater, or whatever.

It was around, it was not an orphan life, essentially.

Oh, it was definitely not an orphan life. And his father brings him to Florence, and apprentices him with Verrocchio, who has a studio. Now, this was a great studio because it’s doing not only art and sculpture, but pageants and plays, and it’s taking the copper ball, that has to be engineered and soldered using mirrors that concentrate the rays of light of the sun. It has to be soldered to be put on top of the dome of Florence’s cathedral, the Duomo, that little copper ball.

Who does it? Leonardo. He’s a young apprentice. He’s also posing for the statue of David as a 12-year-old kid. So we know what he looks like. He’s drawing all of these mechanisms that the studio is using to put the copper ball on top of the dome. So he’s teaching himself. He also has the good fortune to be born in 1452, right when Gutenberg opens up his print shop and starts selling books. It comes to Italy like wildfire. Italy actually becomes the center of publishing by the time Leonardo’s 15.

So in his notebooks we see Leonardo listing every week the books he wants to buy. It’s like Audible, we have to make our list. It’s like, “Get the Euclid,” and fortunately they were all being translated, because Leonardo wasn’t great at Latin, so, “Get the new translation of Euclid that’s at the stationers by the bridge.” These are the type of notes in his notebook.

So what makes him curious? What makes him curious is it wasn’t crammed out of him by some medieval scholastic schooling when he was 10 or 12, and he becomes curious. He wants to learn everything. So he’ll write, “Why is the sky blue?” Now, you and I quit wondering about that at about age 10. We outgrow our wonder years.

Right, absolutely.

Partly maybe because people cram it down and say, “Hey, hey, quit asking.” Leonardo never outgrew his wonder years.

Right, that’s a really good way of putting it. So he grows up, does this apprenticeship. Talk a little bit about the biography that gets him to the person.

Well, he’s an apprentice, and as I said, Verrocchio, his teacher and the master of the shop, does a lot of pageants, including for the Duke of Milan when he’s visiting Florence.

A pageant being a show, essentially.

Shows, outdoor shows. You know, we forget that there’s no TV, no internet, no movies, whatever. So what they do in the evening is they have performances. Some of them are plays, some of them are pageants, some of them are readings or debates. They stage Aspen Institute-like debates, but on grand stages. And they have parades, so one of the first drawings we have of Leonardo is a helmet for one of the costumes ...

I remember that.

For when the Duke of ... Yeah, it’s a beautiful metalpoint, silverpoint in the British Museum, I remember seeing it for the first time. You go ... What people don’t realize, they think it’s a piece of art. No, no. He’s working for Verrocchio, the Duke of Milan is coming to visit Florence, and they’re putting on a parade, and they have to give everybody helmets, and there’s a dragon and eagle’s wings coming out of it, it’s a great fantasy helmet that you and I may have done when we were 10 or 12 years old. Leonardo’s still doing it when he’s 15 or 20. So I think we don’t realize how important plays and pageants were.

Sure, right, to him.

To his growing up.

What do you think gave him, besides being a bastard, an entrepreneurial bent? Or just people are born with it? Because you’ve written about a lot of different people who are entrepreneurs.

Well, first of all he had an imagination, because one of the things about doing plays, pageants and spectacles is you have to blur the line between fantasy and reality. So he’s inventing things. You know that helicopter screw that everybody says, “Oh, he invented the helicopter.” Not exactly. I studied the notebooks. That aerial screw thing was actually done for a play. They’re bringing the angels down from the rafters, and it curves like that. He loves that spiral form of the curve and he loves the flying of the angels and what he called ingenue, ingenious devices.

So he starts inventing ingenious devices for the theater. He blurs the line between imagination and reality. Then he says, “Okay, now let’s try it in the real world.” And now he then does try to make flying machines. He makes gliders. He makes all sorts of weaponry and machinery that are sort of based on some of this theatrical imaginations.

Why is he the one? Because a lot of people do that in theater and then they don’t take it to the next step. What do you think it was about him that he wanted to keep doing it? There’s just this restless curiosity?

I’ll push back a little on the great entrepreneurial spirit, because he was inventive, and he always, he’d invent something that would carve needle ... I mean, would create sewing needles, like a thousand of them per hour, a machine. He said, “This is going to make me wealthy.” He even calculates how wealthy he’s going to be by how much he does. But then he never fully follows through on it.

So his ideas.

There’s something about Leonardo who loves the conception more than the execution. So we have a lot of inventions that never got made. We have a lot of paintings that never got finished. We have treatises that never got published. It’s a bit of a flaw, it’s also a humanizing thing about Leonardo, and it also is, I mean I remember Steve Jobs holds up shipping the original Macintosh because the circuit board inside is not beautiful enough. Steve Jobs knew that sometimes in month you have to follow the normal rule of real artists ship, you get things out the door, but sometimes in life you have to follow the rule which is let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Leonardo sometimes — often — let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

You say Steve Jobs executed quite well and Leonardo didn’t.

But that’s why, by the way, Steve executed quite well, although better on his second tour of duty at Apple than in his first. One reason he leaves Apple in 1985 is, shall we say, the Macintosh is a work of absolute beauty but the execution, sales, supply chains and everything are not working all that well. Likewise, with Leonardo, he executes very well on certain things, but he keeps his inventions and his paintings with him rather than deliver them to patrons all the time. He did not dance to the financial incentives of patrons.

What would you say his personality was like?

Very collegial.

Collegial, rather than ...

He loved everybody around him. You have a contrast of the two great geniuses in Florence at the time. Michelangelo, Leonardo. Michelangelo’s a recluse, sleeps in his dark clothes and boots, doesn’t have any close friends. Leonardo, the other extreme. Throughout his notebooks and the letters and notebooks of contemporaries, he seems to have about 30 best friends. Luca Pacioli, the mathematician, Bramante, you know, a great artist and architect. He goes down the list of all the anatomists who help him, they’re going to do an anatomy book together.

Leonardo is always walking around town, famously in Florence and later in Milan, dressed to the nines, quite a dandy, with an entourage of really interesting people around him, having debates and discussions in town squares, riding off to Pavia for when they’re in Milan to try to figure out how do the proportions of a human relate to the proportions of a church, and he kept Vitruvian Man, that guy in the circle and the square.

One of the things I discovered in my book — and Toby Lester’s written a book about this too, others have done it — is that wasn’t a solo drawing. That was done with friends. He had two friends who were riding with him and doing things and helping design churches, and they all tried to get the man in the circle and the square to be a church.

So when you think about someone that’s an inventor, we’ll get to science in a second, but the technology stuff, the invention stuff. He thought these up but didn’t make a lot. Sometimes he made them or tested them and things like that. What do you think the qualities of someone like that are? Is that someone who you would think of today the same thing?

Oh yeah. I think there are a lot of people, and unfortunately, because this is not one of Leonardo’s great trades, we know a lot of people who come up with great ideas, love perfecting and perfecting and perfecting the idea, but aren’t great at getting the product out the door. I mean, one of the lines that Steve Jobs, Steve Case, Addison apparently used was, vision without execution is hallucination.

There are times when you think of Leonardo and you think, “Hey, that’s a bit of a hallucination.” That perpetual motion machine or that particular type of man-powered flying machine, that is never actually going to be manufactured. On the other hand, as I said, he blurred the line in paintings. Blurring the line as he did in theater, but also in his inventions, between fantasy and reality, actually helped him envision things that 100 years later people would invent.

Right, people would invent later. So he was an apprentice, and then talk about what happened. He was making money ...

He was an apprentice, and as I said, he’s doing paintings. He’s a moderately good painter in Florence in his 20s, but things don’t get finished, like the Adoration of the Magi, St. Jerome in the Wilderness. St. Jerome in the Wilderness is a great example because he’s starting to be interested in anatomy, and you see the entire muscle structure, how it informs the drawings that are going to become St. Jerome in the Wilderness, but he goes back to it 30 years later to redo the neck muscles after he’s done some anatomy. He keeps this thing like for 30 years because he’s a perfectionist.

So at age 30, as I said, he writes this job application, he goes off to Milan trying to be an engineer for the Duke of Milan. In about 1482, when he’s 30 years old, he moves to Milan.

He writes this 11-paragraph ...

He writes this 11-paragraph thing. He moves to Milan. He becomes the engineer and painter, eventually, to the Duke of Milan.

How did he get that job? I know it sounds crazy.

Well, the job application letter didn’t fully help because for the next few years he was just sort of, as you’d say, a freelancer, a contract worker. He doesn’t get a full-time job with benefits.

Gig economy.

By 1490, he’s got a room and board and weekly stipend, living at the castle in Florence, but it takes him a while to get the job, and part of the time he’s actually doing plays and pageants, which is his gig. He’s also inventing certain types of weapons because Milan had a pretty good army, unlike Florence, and he’s starting to paint, especially he’s painting the mistresses of Ludovico, who is the Duke of Milan. So you have Cecilia, the other ... Lady with the Ermine, great portraits.

So why did these people back then ... Talk about the system then. People who are somewhat knowledgeable about Florence or the Medicis or something there. Why did the Duke of Milan have people like this?

This is a great question.

Because you couldn’t start your own company then, if you think about if you want to give a ... Why do people have people like this?

Well, that’s a great thing, like why does the Renaissance happen when it does in Italy? Give you 100 reasons, but the one you asked about is you have a rising middle class, like the Medici. The Medici have become bankers in Florence. And by the way, they become huge bankers because like a lot of people today, they’ve invented new forms, like venture capital and private equity. They’ve taken one of Leonardo’s friends, Luca Pacioli, the mathematician, idea of debit and credit bookkeeping; double entries for debit and credit, which if you’re a businessperson listening to this you get how important that is.

That’s a pretty important invention. It happens right then. So the Medici become huge bankers, along with three or four other bankers. They’re all building their wonderful homes and palazzos, they have to show because they’re rising middle class and not aristocracy that they have as much taste and devotion and class as they do money, so they have a lot of madonnas painted for them by rising artists. The Medici become great patrons of the arts, and once again the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, his father was like a bad mercenary soldier, ends up taking over Milan. He’s not a hereditary aristocracy.

They want to bring smart people in.

Both because they want to embellish their court, they want to ... And many other reasons, and show their worthiness, they create around them courts that have everything from playwrights and poets, to mathematicians and architects and scientists and anatomists.

And engineers.

And engineers. They do it partly for the joy of it, but up until then you didn’t have wealthy patrons trying to prove that they had taste and class.

Was there use to it? So he’s hired as an engineer to do things, or lots of things?

He’s called the engineer and painter, he’s both. I’m not sure Leonardo, just like Steve Jobs, would make that big of a distinction between design and art.

So what did he do from a day to day? What was his job?

A lot of the evenings he helped put on pageants and plays or readings. They staged debates, one of which Leonardo debates that painting is a higher art form than poetry, for example, but they also do plays and pageants that involve big mechanisms and ingenious devices. But during the daytime too, he had paintings that he had to execute, such as most importantly The Last Supper, which he’s doing in the 1490s for the Duke of Milan, at a refectory or dining hall of a monastery, that the duke loved to patronize.

So Leonardo, I mean by this time he’s famous. People are there to watch, to be an audience while he paints. We have descriptions of him. He kind of blows in with his wonderful purple cloaks and tunics and stuff, and will stand in front of the painting for half an hour and then just do two brush strokes, and then disappear. He’d sort of say, “You have to let your ideas marinate,” and so he was a somewhat, he would paint during the day.

So he became famous during this time? He had been famous?

He’s definitely famous, especially by the time he pulled off The Last Supper in the 1490s, and he’s done quite a few portraits for the Duke of Milan. He had been semi-famous in Florence but a little bit more famous for not finishing the Adoration of the Magi than for painting the Adoration of the Magi.

All right, we’re here with Walter Isaacson, he’s written a new book about Leonardo da Vinci. It’s his latest book. Walter’s written a string of them, people that you might have heard of; Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, and Ben Franklin, and Henry Kissinger, which is very different from that group. When we get back we’re going to talk about what Leonardo says about innovation and where innovation is going. We’re here on Recode Decode.

[ad]

We’re here on Recode Decode, and our guest is Walter Isaacson, who I’ve known for a very long time, he’s a great writer, and his latest book ... He’s a reporter, writer and a thought leader, I would say.

Oh, well ...

Oh you are, you have the Aspen Institute, you guys ...

A thought follower.

No, you guys have a lot of big thoughts up there in the mountains. His latest book is on Leonardo da Vinci, and his impact on other innovators and moving things forward. We talked about the middle of his life where he started to get some fame and traction. What was his impact then and now? Let’s talk about that. How did his life end and how did he conduct, he just continued to do the same thing he did his whole life, or was there a difference?

He continues to balance engineering with art. Now, his art indeed surpasses everything anybody has ever done in art, and for that matter in engineering.

Right, I was going to ask, is there any engineering thing that he did?

No. He does a lot of engineering ideas, some of them come to fruition, as I say a century later or two centuries later.

Helicopter.

Exactly.

What else, what other things? People know about the helicopter.

Well, his ability to divert rivers and to show how water flows.

Why did he want to divert a ...

Well, you know, I think just as a little kid. I don’t know if you remember, I remember growing up in New Orleans, a little kid, and you find little streams and rivers in the bayou and you’re diverting it.

I never did that, Walter.

But from the very beginning of his life, the first sketch we have is a landscape drawing. The very last sketches are these swirls of the deluge, and him sitting there looking how water flows against obstacles and forms swirls afterwards. Hey, we all get interested, we all geek out on something, and that was Leonardo’s great fame.

So it leads, as I said, to scientific discoveries that are very significant. Like his dissections invent, among other things, the visual display of information. In other words, he dissects a lot of bodies, and layer after layer he shows the muscles and then the nerves and then the heart, and he does it in layers.

So he uses his painting skills.

Yeah. So the combination of that painting and drawing skills and his anatomy and science skills. So for example, there’s an aortic valve, and people thought that it’s when the blood pushes up from the heart chamber into the valve, past the valve, the pressure then closes the valve. Leonardo said, “No, that wouldn’t work, it would crumble, because I know how water works, flowing fluids work.”

He shows that when you go from a large ventricle to a smaller thing, there’s a swirl, because of the way, just like if you put a pipe into a bowl, it would swirl. It’s that swirl that because of the centrifugal force, opens up the membrane that then becomes the valve. Those are like, whoa, amazing inventions that just about 15 years ago they finally, totally proved with magnetic imaging and other ways to look at, actual, it happen.

So Leonardo designed, for example, for the Duke of Milan and then for Francis I, the king of France, who is his last patron. He goes to Amboise in France. He designs ideal cities, because he understands that the greatest scourge they have back then is the plague. It keeps decimating cities. He realizes bad sanitation is underlying the plague.

So he invents a type, or designs a type of city, in which below the surface there’s sewer drainage lines, that the water flows through to a lower surface with sewage and drainage, which also has deliveries and horses that they need to be cleaned up after, etc. The top layer is where the people walk and live.

Which is what we have today.

Yeah, it’s what we have today. Now, they never fully built it, either ...

But he thought about it.

But he thought about it and he drew it, and had they built it they would have stopped another 100 years of the plague, probably. The other thing he does, that I love, is mathematics. There’s a lot of mathematical things that kind of work, kind of don’t, but he tries something that’s impossible. Every now and then you have to try something that’s impossible to figure out why it’s impossible and to push yourself.

That’s the age-old problem of squaring the circle, which means taking a circle of a certain area and trying to make a square of the exact same area using only a protractor and ruler, for reasons that your listeners know, most of your listeners know, that’s impossible because pi is a wildly irrational number and so it can’t actually be done that way.

But Leonardo tries hundreds of ways to do it, even when he’s young, he’s drawing and you get to Vitruvian Man, there’s the guy in the circle and the square with the same area, tries to be, because the circle extends higher than the square so the navel can be at the center of the circle and the genitals are right in the center of the square.

But here’s what I was going to get to. His last notebook page that we know, because you asked about his life. He ends his life in France under the patronage of Francis I, and we have a page in which he’s thinking about a variety of things, but in the margin he’s doing four more drawings that show a right triangle, changing the length of the legs, triangles inside shaded, trying to do that transformation of shapes till the very end. The last line, it dribbles off, it says, “Here’s another way of looking at it.” Then it pauses, says, “But the soup is getting cold.”

You imagine, there he is, upstairs in the little manor house that he gets with his whole entourage and students and everybody’s waiting downstairs. His cook is named Materine, we know about her, when he dies he leaves her a cloak and some other things. You just imagine him there, even though he’s old, even though he’s dying, even though there’s people waiting downstairs, still trying to square the circle.

That’s great.

But the soup is getting cold.

How could he do ... We’re going to finish up talking a little bit how he would do today and where innovation is, because you’ve written that innovation’s been a big theme throughout your career. How would he do today? What would he think of the internet?

Well, there’s a couple of things I would think about. One is, as I said, he was born when Gutenberg ...

Right, so he loved technology.

So he loved to drill down and teach himself. He would love the fact that just like he could use books to teach himself everything from math to anatomy to Vitruvius’s design of churches and experience, and mix books with experience. He would just think that the internet is even greater than Gutenberg’s invention, because anybody anywhere can find out almost anything about everything, and then share their knowledge with anyone. This, to Leonardo, would be heaven.

I think a downside would be, in his notebooks you see at times he’s distracted, or he gets totally obsessed sometimes, like 42 attempts to square the circle all on one page, and just page after page of geeking out on squaring the circle. He had these mood swings and depressions where he’s doing storms and stuff.

In our day and age, he probably would have been diagnosed with 42 different types of ADHD and obsessive compulsive and depression and manic and I don’t like applying labels like that, and they may have put him on some pharmaceutical regimen to cure them all and we may not have had the Mona Lisa.

Right, right, that’s true. So what do you think his impact on innovation is? Because you said a lot of people were very interested in him. Where do we get innovation? Is that just born or just people are like that?

I think you can be as a kid curious, and especially if you’re like Leonardo, you say, “Let me just explore things,” because you have a natural curiosity. But here’s a point I want to make, and it’s one of the themes of the book. Partly it’s a natural curiosity, but it’s also something you can cultivate. You can will yourself to be more curious. When I look at the list of things he asked each day, like how does light form luster on a shiny leaf, why do people yawn, what does the tongue of a woodpecker look like? Who wakes up one morning and wants to know about a tongue of a woodpecker?

Right, I don’t know.

But Leonardo did. And throughout his life, it’s kind of an interesting topic. Each of us, in our daily lives, can pause for a moment. I’m sitting in a room, it’s a podcast room, and I’m touching the things that deaden the sound, and they’re pyramids, and the light’s hitting the pyramid, they’re quite beautiful, but I also wonder, okay, that pyramid design of the foam, why does that deaden sound a little bit better than a flat design would? You think about it for a moment, you can figure it out.

But having worked on Leonardo for so long, I try, I’m never going to be Leonardo, but I try to just see the most ordinary things in life and pause for an extra 10 seconds to say, “Why?” And be curious.

So are you worried about innovation now, or do you think this just always happens, innovation just happens in cycles, or where do you think we are?

I think we went through a period when you and I were coming of age, and when Silicon Valley had the combination of the microchip, the internet and the personal computer. Then eventually the iPhone, and then mobile. All of that comes together to create innovation that’s completely transformative. I don’t think we’re in a phase like that right now. Most of the innovation is on things like social media or whatever, which is fine, but it doesn’t change the world the way having apps on an iPhone allows Ubers and Airbnbs and everything else.

Although some might argue that the social media’s become weaponized.

Oh I think social media is deeply, deeply influential. Don’t get me wrong. I just think that it’s not like Gutenberg’s printing press, necessarily, in terms of being a platform upon which a whole set of intellectual property is ...

No, but we do get to yell at each other a lot, and get angry.

Yeah, and there’s, yeah. That’s a downside.

There’s not greatness in Twitter, let’s just say.

Well, I mean this will be for another podcast, but the type of social media we invented enshrines anonymity, which I think hurts the civility of it, and anonymity is very important, we have to keep it, but we also ought to have places, like Leonardo or Steve Jobs and others had, that are common ground, where you actually know the people you’re talking to. So, to me, I think we need civil places as well as anonymous places, but that’s for a different podcast.

But when we get ... Does genius just happen, like it’s born, or ...? You’ve been writing about geniuses, really.

When I wrote about Einstein, I said, “Okay, some people are just born.” They’re touched by lightning, and they have a mental processing power that will allow them to figure out tensor calculus and how it can be used to describe the curvature of space and time. You think, “No, I can’t pause each day and look at the sound acoustical tiles and be like Einstein.”

That’s why I liked writing about Leonardo. His first biographer, who was a contemporary of Vasari, another painter, said he was touched by lightning with superhuman powers. No, he actually ... Well, I mean he was touched with great talent in painting, but his ability to will himself to ask questions and be curious each day, the ability to push himself, to observe more carefully, go down to the moats around the castle and look at the dragonflies, full-wing dragonflies, to see if the wings alternate or whether they go in unison. You don’t have to be a genius to do it. You just have to have the will to be observant.

All of us can have the will to be more observant, can indulge fantasy and not knock it out of our children and ourselves the way we sometimes do, can indulge curiosity, even about not just useful curiosity, not just I need to know exactly how this new microchip will do a pascal code better or not, but curiosity for curiosity’s sake, like the tongue of the woodpecker.

It’s really interesting, because one of my sons is very inventive, like he’s got rooms and rooms of inventions.

This does not surprise me.

Well, I know, but I think he’s just born with it. I literally do, because the things he comes up with, I think about it a lot because I think, how did he get this way? Because my other son’s great and he’s really fun, but it’s not the same thing.

Well, we’re all born differently, and we all indulge that.

I know, but it’s a certain level of invention. He’s literally always ...

And you and Megan are going to be particularly good in not destroying that in him and not knocking it out of him.

No, not at all, but I do think it was genetic. I just do, I think he just has like ...

You will have experts on this show much better at knowing the mix and combination of heritage and breeding.

When I was thinking of Leonardo, like even I was looking at the notebooks, I’m like, he has a notebook like that. He just writes things down. He makes some of them, he doesn’t make some of them. I just wonder how, if it’s possible.

But don’t sell him short. It wasn’t just that he was blessed with it, it’s he is curious and indulges it and pushes himself and allows himself. So if we kind of say it’s all genetic ...

Genius, just genius.

Yeah, if genius is all genetic, then we’re not going to say, “Let me pause and look at the way the light’s hitting those leaves.”

Let’s end on that, because we’re facing some really big issues in this country, besides the horrible political environment, which will pass as they always do.

That’s about storms, they pass.

They pass. So what do you imagine are the lessons of Leonardo? Because it really is the very best of humanity, that kind of thinking, like this kind of thinking. So give me the end on, the lessons that we have to think about going forward, because we’re dealing with robotics, AI, automation, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars. There’s a lot of big challenges for our society. All of which are inventive, but ...

I actually end this book in a way I haven’t ended my other books, which is just come right out and say, “Here’s the 25 lessons.”

I know, that’s why I was asking.

Because in some ways it’s a culmination of having learned from Ben Franklin and Einstein and Steve Jobs and Ada Lovelace and the innovators, and this is somewhat of a culminating book. I don’t think I’m going to write about another big, innovative inventive genius again. So I say, “Okay, here are the lessons,” and some I mentioned, which is stay curious, take notes, be observant.

But I think one of the huge lessons of everybody I’ve learned about is to combine the humanities with engineering, to combine art with science. Nowadays we silo things, there’s going to be a point where even your inventive kid is going to be told, “Okay, drill down in engineering or math or whatever, specialize.” No. Learning coding is important and learning engineering is important, but someday machines will code pretty well and help us. But what will be the Ada Lovelace moment, because she was the one who wrote about this in 1830, was the combination of human creativity and machine processing power, having an inventiveness that will exceed what machines alone can do, or what humans alone can do.

It’s interesting. Some of the things, the jobs, the future, the only ones that will exist will be ones which have humanity or creativity also involved in them. Then the rest are just digital.

But “also” is an important word, which is you have to interweave an ability to be creative and a sense of the humanities, with a sense of engineering. You can’t be a humanist and cede that to the engineers. That’s what Vitruvian Man, that’s our poster for that, which is be like Leonardo, there he is, standing there, spread eagle, in the world, in the cosmos, trying to figure out how we fit in, combining creativity with scientific anatomy, and that humanism is what’s going to help us when we get artificial intelligence, when we face the moral issue that algorithms might get out of our control.

They are out of our control.

Right. And it’s those with a feel for both the humanities, history, art, music, and the patterns of nature, how they ripple from the rivers that we see as a kid, to our heart valve, to the equations we do to describe the curvature of space and time. All of these patterns, if we have a feel for it, and a feel for the humanities, which is about, at its core, why change happens, why some people resist it, and some people cause it. Humanities, at its core, is what is creativity, how do you achieve it? Leonardo, the lessons in the last chapter of the book are all about the need for that combinations of creativity.

Right. The thing is, the reason he is also known is for the movies and for the movie and the books by whatchamacallit. Did that bother you? The popularity of the popular books with Tom Hanks, “The Da Vinci Code.”

Oh, “The Da Vinci Code.” No. I love anything that makes ... I thought you were talking about Leonardo DiCaprio, who is doing the biographical movie, or at least bought the rights to it.

So this is to make this?

Yeah, he acquired the rights to make my biography into a movie. “The Da Vinci Code,” of Dan Brown, it’s a wonderful work of fiction. Sometimes he pushes it and says, “Oh no, it’s all true.” No, John in The Last Supper is actually John, it’s not Mary Magdalene. We know that. But, what he does and what Tom Hanks does, what all these people do, is combine imagination and fantasy with reality, and we can scoff at that or we can admire and learn from it. I think Leonardo would have us ...

Right, although people do think that’s Mary Magdalene now, you know that? Because of that movie.

Okay, let me just tell people, fake news is sometimes wrong, novels are sometimes fiction, and The Last Supper, trust me, John leans on Jesus’s breast, and in the painting he’s starting to lean the other way. Leonardo has created a narrative painting in which “one of you shall betray me” is emanating from Jesus, each one is reacting as they would in a theater, it’s not a still scene, it’s a dramatic, emotional, narrative scene, and that’s John, it’s not Mary Magdalene.

That’s just all it is? Oh Walter, you’re making ... It was so exciting when it was Mary Magdalene. What’s your next book? Last question.

I think I’m going to do a book about New Orleans and maybe about Storyville in the 1890s, maybe about Lulu White, who was an octoroon, who opened a sporting house and hired Jelly Roll Morton to be the piano player, and Louis Armstrong.

Oh, so totally different.

But also it’s about race, because that was before the color line was drawn, because it was right during that decade that somebody who was a neighbor, named Homer Plessy, boards a train and we get Plessy v. Ferguson, which is so destructive, because it allows the drawing of a color line legally. Those type of things interest me. But it’s not going to be another genius innovator book. Leonardo da Vinci and the last chapter of it culminates.

Culminates. And you’re leaving the Aspen Institute?

Well, I’m going to move down, I’m going to be a teacher of history, I’m going to teach at Tulane. My first course, which I hope you’ll come lecture at, is called History of the Digital Revolution, from Ada to Zuckerberg, and your listeners don’t need to explain what Ada to Zuckerberg means.

Are you running for mayor of New Orleans?

No, the mayor’s race is actually the week after next.

Well, there’s lots of mayor’s races in the future.

Well yeah, I mean four, eight years from now. I haven’t, I don’t know what I’m doing then. There are two wonderful women running for mayor of New Orleans this time around.

Good. All right, well, Walter Isaacson, as usual you are also a very curious person. I’m excited to read your next book.

What do you mean by that?

It’s a compliment.

Thank you.

Anyway, thanks for coming."

Now the company wants you to buy a digital lock for your home that will let strangers (a.k.a. delivery people) open the door to leave packages inside.

The announcement of the Amazon Key system alarmed some privacy advocates and elicited sneering comparisons to Juicero and Soylent from the Washington Post. But don’t take the backlash at face value, says Recode’s Jason Del Rey: Even though it represents yet another way in which Amazon is trying to enter our daily lives, Amazon Key might be legitimately useful for some consumers.

“There are actually a ton of Americans all over the country who have packages stolen,” Del Rey said on the latest episode of Too Embarrassed to Ask. “I think it’s kind of crazy to lump this in with those [Juicero and Soylent]. I see the convenience angle, ‘How lazy could we possibly get?’ But I think this is different. This is, 'I don’t want my shit stolen!’”

“Privacy is a topic that gets people worked up, as it sometimes should,” he added. “People are saying, ‘Wait, now we’re giving this company access to my home? How much more are we giving away?’ ... I think in a world where we get into the car with strangers, we sleep at strangers' homes with Airbnb, some people won’t like it and some people will feel comfortable with it.”

You can listen to the new podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

On the new podcast, Del Rey addressed other concerns about privacy and Amazon’s growing influence on our lives. At the center of the discussion was the success of the company’s hardware, such as the Amazon Echo and its main feature, the virtual assistant Alexa.

“When people go online, where do they start searching for a product?” he said. “There’s some third-party data that’s showing that more than half of U.S. internet users now start on Amazon. In a world in which voice starts carving out pieces of online commerce, not only does that help Amazon, but it hurts Google even more so in product search.”

Alexa gets smarter and learns more about you by listening to your voice searches, but you can delete them from its memory from the Alexa mobile app, Del Rey explained. Trying to prune those one by one might be ultimately futile, though, if voice continues to find its way into more and more devices.

“When you see young children in houses that have these devices talk or communicate with them — let alone, the adults — but I watch my 4-and-a-half-year-old, it’s very clear why a lot of people look at this as the future of computing,” Del Rey said.

Peter Kafka: This is Recode Media with Peter Kafka. That’s me, I’m part of the Vox Media podcast network, I’m speaking to you from Vox’s New York headquarters, but I’m just going to be here for a minute, because we’re going to go live, on tape, to Joe’s Pub. This is a show I did this week. We talked to Michael Barbaro, he’s the host of the New York Times’ mega hit podcast The Daily. He’s great, the audience is really great, they loved hearing him. You will like hearing from him too, so let’s go to Joe’s Pub right now.

Who here listens to podcasts besides Recode Media? Who listens to the New York Times The Daily podcast? I have good news. We have the host of The Daily’s podcast, Michael Barbaro. Come on out, Michael. Here he is.

Michael Barbaro: Hello. Hi Peter, thank you so much.

Sure, how are you?

I’m nervous. I mean, Samantha Bee? Cable TV?

I’m sorry. But we did tell you in advance.

I know.

Listen, we also, I got a bone to pick with you. We talked, we said we don’t want to overthink this, but you asked me, “What are you going to wear?”

Yeah.

“Because I’m going to dress very casually.” I said, “I’m wearing a jacket.” you said, “Great.” Now ...

What?

No, you look great.

Well, thank you.

I would like the guests to sort of dress down a little bit. But thank you for coming anyway, thank you for coming on an evening. You often are working this time of night, right?

Yeah.

Putting the show together?

We had to rush the whole show, we had to change the whole news cycle just for you. We had to ask the president not to make any news.

Thank you. We were talking about this backstage.

I heard.

We were talking about this onstage, with Sam about sort of what the bar for a Trump story is.

It changes.

You’ve changed. So, Twitter fight with Bob Corker ...

Corker didn’t make it tonight.

Broke up with Jeff Flake, Jeff Flake broke up with him, does that ...

Flake made it in.

That made it in. What else is in tomorrow’s podcast?

So tomorrow’s podcast is fascinating. It’s a conversation about what really happened in Niger with those U.S. servicemen who were killed. This is kind of classic Daily. What we do is we took the concept of that news conference in the Rose Garden that the president had last week, where the question from a reporter was, “Could we ask you to talk about what happened in Niger?” And if you listen really carefully, the president was asked to talk about what had happened in Niger, and he went on a tangent and took it to the subject of his phone calls to servicemen and began to compare that with President Barack Obama, and made a bunch of dubious claims about that.

We just rewound the tape and said what if we just start that news conference all over again and answer the original question from the reporter, which was, “Can you talk about Niger?” We ask the question “What really happened there?” And my colleague Helene Cooper — who covers the Pentagon for the Times — talks about that. Like any great Daily segment, it has an idea embedded in it, which you can ask me about.

I do want to ask, I’m just, I’m running through my head, so is this going to be a New York Times story as well? Then you guys are gonna talk about that?

No, great question.

Thank you.

This is ... It’s very funny, when I ask questions of guests and they say, “Great question,” I can’t tell if they’re flattering me.

I find usually when someone says, “Great question ...”

They’re stalling.

Yeah, “I don’t want to answer your question.”

Yeah. Such a good question.

It’s a polite way of saying “fuck you.”

I don’t know about that. By the way, that was a great question.

I get that more often. All right.

No, in The Daily, which is a podcast, it’s now seven months in at the New York Times, I think when we envisioned it, was going to be pretty consistently teeing off and tethered to a story in the New York Times. As we evolved, and as we did with this episode for tomorrow, we started to tap into the wisdom of Times journalists beyond what they might be writing for the paper.

They are, in and of themselves, mini newspapers, mini New York Times on their beats, who know their subject so well that you can draw them in and have a conversation about something that they’re not writing a story about. That’s what we did with Helene Cooper, tomorrow, she has been investigating what’s happening in Niger, she goes to all the news conferences, she’s talking to sources and having constant conversations, and she has a way of talking about it as a human being, being curious about it, admitting what she doesn’t know about it, that makes you have an appreciation for the story as well as the storyteller, the journalist, that I think often is missing from a newspaper story.

I think it’s fascinating, New York Times, paper of record, right, now is encouraging its journalists, or some of them are doing it, and going out and saying, “This is a story I have not reported in the New York Times.”

Right.

First of all. Two, “I don’t know a lot of the answers I’m talking about,” or, “This is not a definitive version,” this is a, sort of, almost my working notes, right? Was it a big culture shift to get them to do that, or did they want to do it right away, as soon as you offered them the chance to come in and talk about something that you have not yet figured out?

I want to be clear, oftentimes they have figured something out. But sometimes they’re in the middle of figuring it out. I mean, we’re trying to talk to someone like Peter Baker, who’s a White House reporter at the Times, or Maggie Haberman, White House reporter at the Times, in the middle of their working day, so their thoughts are evolving, their journalism is accumulating.

The biggest evolution, I would say, was the organization recognizing, and I think it had, I think that’s why The Daily exists, that your relationship with the New York Times was, for the most part, predicated on this idea that tablets were being handed down to you every morning, and they were very authoritative and omniscient in their voice, and that all of our relationships with journalism are really changing, and that the idea of omniscience itself is held in doubt, and that it may not have ever really existed, that it was more of a conceit.

So The Daily says that journalism is this fast-evolving thing, that journalists can say what they know and say what they don’t know, and talk very openly about their process. It creates a lot of transparency that I think people crave right now.

That’s a really big shift. That is, I mean, we’ve seen media evolve that way for a couple of decades, right, since the web, in various forms, and on Twitter and Facebook, but the New York Times in particular, and a few other papers, said, “We’re not just gonna let people just randomly put stuff out.”

No, and we don’t.

“We’re still the New York Times. And what we do is meaningful, and the fact that it’s in the newspaper is a thing.” So the idea now that it’s sort of leeching out into other vectors is really interesting to me.

Yeah, and just to be clear, this is of course fact-based journalism, and it is authoritative, I think the most authoritative journalism in the world. The way that The Daily interacts with that journalism is to let the journalists talk about it in a really vulnerable, transparent way.

Can we talk about how you got to this. You had been at the paper, what, 11 years?

Yes.

Did retail, business reporting.

Retail, yeah.

A lot of politics reporting.

I covered all that.

I don’t mind asking where you got that. Last summer, you’re covering politics?

Is this a subway?

Yeah, I forgot that, in case you guys are hearing that now or later on a podcast, we are above a transit hub. So that’s maybe a D train? I don’t know, I’m not that good at.

Audience member: 4, 5, 6.

4, 5, 6, thank you. Very good audience here.

Did you raise your hand and say, “I would like to try a podcast”? How did that come about?

No. I was asked to do this. In fact, it’s a long, complicated story, I was not the first person to be asked, but I was asked to do podcasting at the New York Times. In the first iteration, it was a campaign podcast that was created by two people in the audience here, Lisa Togin, Samantha Heneg, thank you for recreating my career.

The Times got very excited about audio, hired some of the smartest people in audio, and the idea was that we could quickly create a podcast that would cover the uneventful final three months of the 2016 presidential campaign. We rushed into that, and we had an epiphany right away, which was that ...

Before you get to that ...

Sorry, am I racing?

It’s this historic election, they’re all historical elections, and now it seems evident, oh obviously you’d want to get into podcasts, but last summer, podcasting was still sort of a new idea, and especially with the New York Times, having an authoritative podcast was a new idea.

That’s fair.

Did you say, “Well no, I wanna do the stuff that Maggie Haberman, everyone else is doing?”

I was doing — first of all, no one does what Maggie Haberman does, I just want to lay that out there. She’s a totally unique, genetic breed. I was covering the campaign as a writer of live debate coverage and election nights, primary nights, kind of moments and investigations, including of Donald Trump.

The idea was that I would split my time as a reporter and podcaster. As anyone will tell you in podcasting, it’s very time consuming, and so the balance quickly shifted to audio.

The way you do it. We just kind of knock these things out, actually. So it wasn’t you saying, “I’m going to give up the thing that I like.”

No, for a while it was the best possible scenario, and if you can do this as your work life, I highly recommend it, to take the risk of doing what you’re doing and trying something new simultaneously, and that was what I was able to do.

Then, when did you guys say, “Oh, this should be a daily podcast, and we’ll call it The Daily.”

When the run-up started, the epiphany that I was starting to refer to, I think when the subway came down, was that the Times reporters coming on were a bit like the hosts on the “Today” show, or on any of the morning shows, the kind of family units of mom, dad, son, daughter. You have your familiar relationships with them.

Suddenly we were realizing that if you had these highly compelling authoritative Times reporters on, whether it was Maggie Haberman or Nick Confessore or Patrick Healy, on and on, people wanted to hear them. They wanted to hear them every week. They wanted to imbibe this insider understanding of the campaign, this, in some cases, decades-long authority on the subject of the candidates, and we realized we could recreate that twice a week.

Then after the campaign, I think The Daily was the next natural extension. If we can do this twice a week and we can develop a significant audience, can we do it every day? That was a crazy leap, and I heard Samantha say how great it is to be once a week, and she is probably right, how great it is to be once a week, because putting out a daily show is incredibly taxing.

Let’s talk about the network schedule.

Sure.

So you start what time?

We start in the morning, at 9:30, which is when the New York Times still has probably its most ancestral meeting in the morning.

So that’s the print schedule, right?

And they meet and talk about the news.

What is gonna be in tomorrow’s newspaper?

Exactly. Or on today’s website.

But that’s the premise of that meeting.

That’s the original premise of it, yeah. Now it really is a web-based meeting for the New York Times and our website, and we start there and we begin to brainstorm and collaborate.

So you sit in on that meeting and say, “Oh, this is what we’re working on.”

One of the members of our team, yeah, sits on that meeting, and we figure out what’s in the news, and then we tackle one subject or two subjects, and we find a reporter at the Times. Oftentimes we have to contend with massive time differences, reporters in, at the border of Myanmar need lots of advance notice.

The one thing I’ll say about my colleagues, and it keeps blowing my mind, is just how game they are at, no matter what time of night it is, to do these incredibly complicated things. If you’ve ever listened to The Daily, what you’ll never know is how many of these reporters get on the phone with one receiver to their ear, and then an iPhone to the other that is turned on airplane mode and they record directly into that one, and we call it self-syncing, and it means that the quality sounds really, really high. People do that under bedsheets, and behind curtains, and in all sorts of places and all sorts of countries.

But, they do it for a long time, right?

Oh, for an, I mean, we can talk to people for an hour and a half.

Right, because it’s a 20 minute show, and you guys are very deliberate about that, but I was talking to Jim Rutenberg, I had him on for like five minutes on one of my shows. He said, “Oh it’s much easier, because I do The Daily thing, it was two hours.” Literally.

We are very meticulous. To get 20 minutes of really high-quality audio, it can take a lot of recording time.

Are there stories that you want to do — “This is timely, let’s do it” — that reporter’s not available? That reporter’s in a different time zone, can’t be reached.

Yes. Yes, that happens. That’s a real bummer.

And so you go to story Plan B, Plan C?

Or you go to a different reporter, or you go to ... we get really creative, and we decide that we can tell the story through a primary actor. We can talk to somebody like Eric Lipton, who’s a remarkable colleague of mine who investigates the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and we can marry him with a woman who has spent three decades at the EPA but has just quit because she’s unhappy with the Trump administration policies, and those two things together will make a show.

When a reporter’s not available, we figure out if an actor in the story’s available, can talk to us, and oftentimes that is as compelling, occasionally more compelling. So we’re constantly trying to figure out, do you want to hear from somebody in the world today? Do you want to hear from a New York Times reporter? Do you want to hear from them both and weave them back and forth?

Reporters talking about stories they’ve read and stories they’re working on. A reporter you’ve known, they do that all the time, but it’s one thing to do it at the bar or wherever, it’s another thing to do it on air, knowing this is going to go out. Do you have to convince people, “No, this is a good thing, you should do it,” or does everyone get it now?

Everyone gets it now, everyone gets it. The feedback that you get from being a storyteller in audio is so profound, and the volume of it is so significant that the minute a journalist has been on the show at the Times, they want to come back on. By and large.

[ad]

Now we’re going back to Joe’s Pub to hear more from Michael Barbaro.

Journalists talking about their stories, it was the premise of a lot of video projects.

Yes.

Did not work. Did live versions of it, taped versions of it, the Times has spent a ton of time and a ton of money trying to figure out video, more or less without success. They’ve done some cool projects, but they don’t have a hit like this. Why do you think this works in audio, and video has frustrated the Times — and everyone else, by the way.

I don’t understand video, so I should just say that. It’s not a business or a journalism that I am involved enough in to say why it does or doesn’t work. I can just say that as somebody who’s been on television, and thinks about television, what’s really special about a show like The Daily ... Well, there’s two parts, I want to break it down.

One is that audio on demand on your phone means that you can load it at home, get on the subway, you can listen to it in your car on a long drive, wherever you are it’s with you, and it’s intimate and it’s small. Your eyes can be doing what they do during the day, you can be on the subway.

But it is demanding, it takes your, it requires you to pay attention.

But you don’t need to be stationary in front of a television, or in front of a screen, and I think that’s very liberating for people. I think that’s part of the reason why on-demand podcasting is a success in the case of The Daily. Then, I forgot the second half of my point.

That’s all right, I can fan for a little while while you think about it. You mentioned business. You’re not on the business side, but do you have a sense of sort of what the Times’ ambition for The Daily is? Is it, “We want this to be popular and then we’ll run ads against it, we’ll make money that way”? It’s, “We want to convince people to get subscriptions by listening to the Daily”? “We want people who already subscribe to the Times to find another reason to enjoy listening to the Times, and we’ll retain more of them”?

I believe it’s all of the above. We wanna be a part of a company that attracts young people to develop life-long habits with the New York Times. That habit for my parents, and maybe for yours, was the New York Times arriving in the blue bag on the doorstep.

On Sunday.

On Sunday? Or on the rest of the week. I still get the print subscription, I’m grateful to all of you who get the print subscription still, because it really does help pay the bills. Now it might be the podcast, it might be The Daily on your screen.

So one thing we do is we get people excited about the Times. We create intimate relationships with reporters that we hope are very valuable and make people want to pay for the content. But the biggest thing we do is we just, we give the journalism a new avenue for people to consume it, and therefore we extend the brand and its values.

This was a hit out of the gate, right? You launched the beginning of February?

We launched in February right after the inauguration.

And you could feel it immediately.

I think we could feel pretty quickly that people were craving the kind of really rich, explanatory journalism that we were doing, and the numbers started to grow pretty quickly. And as the news changed and got more and more complicated and confusing, we saw our audiences responding to our attempts to just really peel back the onion.

I’d say we do two things that I think matter in this moment, and Samantha talked about the challenges of this moment, the scale of news under this presidency. I think the most important thing we do is we start a story at the beginning, and we get you through to the end. So much journalism is about kind of an incremental understanding of what changed between yesterday and today. A lot of us don’t really understood where yesterday was.

Almost none of us do. I find it’s mostly the reporters and the editors know ...

Where is the story? What is Boko Haram? Why do we pay income taxes? Some of the most basic questions we ask at the Daily — and we’re giddy about it, because we feel liberated to ask those questions — are why I think listeners really care about the show.

The second thing is that, it’s pretty soulful story telling. It’s narratives that have a human being at the center of them. I wouldn’t say The Daily ever sets out to make people cry, but we cry so much at the studio when we’re having conversations with the people we talk to, that we know inevitably some of our listeners are gonna be crying as well, and the combination of explanatory journalism and really emotional narrative journalism is I think what makes The Daily so special.

Last one where I can sort of imagine you crying — wrong way to put it — was the interview with the gun store owner in Virginia.

I don’t think I cried during that interview.

But you can sort of see the, how the ...

But, you’re right.

You can sort of see the emotion welled up. It was a straight factual story, why do you sell guns, turns out you sold guns that were used in this mass murder, you still sell them. I could sort of feel your jaw dropping as you’re going through the interview.

Right. And we had a man on the telephone — and, by the way, I think what’s not discussed enough is the power of getting someone on the telephone. When I think about what you’re willing to say to someone on the phone in your life, I think about what makes some of the conversations we have so powerful.

It was just occurring to me backstage, actually, that there’s something about that medium, and it’s the opposite of video, right? When you have a video screen in front of you, and I’m sitting there with it, with you, it’s very hard to feel some of the feelings you feel when you’re on the phone with someone for two hours really talking.

That was the interview with the owner of a gun store. That gun store owner happened to sell the gun to the Virginia Tech shooter. All of us really wanted to ask him some very straightforward questions. What is it like to sell a gun used in a mass murder? But above all we wanted him to be a human being, telling the story of what it means to be a gun shop owner. What do you care about? What do you wake up in the morning thinking about? What was your reaction to selling this gun? And along the way he told us a bunch of other stories that blew our minds, no pun intended.

He sold a gun to a woman who walked out of the store and killed herself. How do you even process that?

And said he didn’t feel bad about it because she would’ve killed herself some other way.

He had very complicated reactions to all these things. The most important feedback we got about that episode was from listeners, including a 17-year-old girl who wrote to us to say, “I never thought I wanted to hear from a gun shop owner who could’ve been in this chain, in this link, in this kind of horrible thing, but I now completely understand where he’s coming from at least. And that’s something.”

One thing that struck me about that episode in particular was you, post-Trump you had a lot of journalists doing a lot of soul searching, saying we’ve really got to get out there into the country and put on our flak helmets and go interview real people, and I think they all meant well, I don’t know how many of them are doing it.

I think a lot of them are.

Yeah. It strikes me that when you guys are doing an interview with a gun shop owner, for a lot of Daily listeners, that’s the first gun shop owner they talk to.

I think that’s right.

Are you making a point of saying we want to bring people to the New York Times audience the New York Times audience would not encounter some other way?

Yeah, and if that means bringing different people to the New York Times audience, if it means the New York Times audience changes, that would be wonderful, too.

Launched the show in February, right after the inauguration, how much of your thought process goes into Trump and how much Trump stuff you can do, and whether or not you’re doing too much Trump stuff? I think I started listening to you probably during Comey.

Yeah.

You guys had amazing reporters who were breaking news and telling stuff, astonishing stuff, and only afterwards did I think, “Oh, I’d like to hear stuff that’s not Trump related.”

Right. It’s a constant debate and balance that we discuss on the show. If we made the show about Trump every day, I think the power of the individual stories would be really diminished. We hear from listeners who say, “I don’t want to hear the president’s voice on your show anymore.” That’s not a debate we’re willing to have. Then we hear from listeners who say, “I want to better understand this president, can you find us more ways of exploring it?”

I think one of the challenges is to not get lazy, and to just run audio of either the president talking or the president’s critics talking, doing the one side, the other side. Our goal in episodes like what we did on James Comey is to find the people in the middle of the story and get them to tell a story you’ve never heard before.

I think we did that with James Comey, because the saga of James Comey goes back a decade or more to understanding who he is, what motivates James Comey, why has he made the decisions he has. It turns out he’s, according to our journalism, he’s super self-conscious, and aware of what the world thinks of James Comey and the institutions he runs, and has made decisions that you can trace back to those approaches to the way the world saw him and the FBI.

The last amazing thing I heard from you guys was Monday, Bill O’Reilly, the reporters who broke the last settlement story.

Yes.

You sent them with a recorder to go talk, they were going to go talk to Bill O’Reilly anyway, and you said, “Take this device, and get an actual ...”

Okay, so here’s where I need to be really candid about this. Emily Steele is a remarkable reporter at the Times who’s broken an extraordinary number of stories about Bill O’Reilly and has convinced many of the women who accused him of sexually harassing them to talk on the record, which takes so much courage. She came to us, and said, “We’re gonna do an interview with Bill O’Reilly, don’t tell anyone.” And she said, “Could I have a high-quality microphone?”

She wanted to do it, she knew the value, this would be good for the podcast.

Yep. And that’s a wonderful development in our world, that journalists feel that this is being integrated into their process of storytelling. And they brought a recorder, and they brought a big fancy recorder in called the Zoom into that interview, and around the time that they thought the interview was over, and Bill O’Reilly thought the interview was over, they turned the off button on that microphone, you could literally hear it in the episode, off went the microphone, but Emily Steele and Mike Schmidt — who’s another reporter at the Times who’s broken a lot of stories on this and other subjects — they both had their iPhones still recording.

Not secretly, they just, Bill O’Reilly didn’t know it, and when he thought the interview was over, he started to get louder and louder.

Because he was basically mute/unresponsive for most of the interview.

Yes.

Then he thinks the interview’s over, he thinks he’s off the record, I guess.

Right, and the curses fly, and he’s very angry, and he’s telling them to think about his children and what they’re going to be going through, and he calls the whole thing “crap.” And we played that in the show, and we talked about what that was like for the two reporters to be there.

It’s astonishing, if you guys haven’t heard it, you should hear it. I’m sure there’s a reference to it in the Times, I’m sure the Times story quotes from it, but until you hear Bill O’Reilly speaking as Bill O’Reilly, without a filter, thinking that no one is recording him, you cannot understand what he’s talking about and that anger he has ...

That’s right. The human voice doesn’t lie, whether it’s a worker at a ball-bearing factory who is crushed by the loss of her job, or it’s President Trump being himself, or it’s Bill O’Reilly. There’s such a power in the lack of a visual distraction, in just hearing the voice and hearing someone think out loud. I think that’s why we’re living in this golden age of audio and podcasting.

I didn’t understand it until I got into either, it was very new to me. I didn’t listen to a lot of podcasts. But now, I appreciate all the power that resides in the truth we tell with our voice.

You are a famous person now. Famous-ish person. Do you get recognized?

I don’t believe that.

I think you do.

I do. I get recognized once in a while, and it’s a little disorienting, because I think we think of audio as ...

Your picture is not on top of the iTunes icon, but people are googling you.

No, but I’m vain enough to have a curated Twitter photo.

I think journalists, you like bylines, you like being recognized for your work, but that’s different than going to a bodega and being recognized.

That’s not happening.

That’s not happening?

Bodega, no.

Where do you get recognized?

On the New York City subway. We live in the capital of podcasting, and lots of people in New York City listen to the show, so once in a while.

Within the New York Times cultures, which has traditionally been, “We’re the New York Times, we’re the institution, we help you build a career, but you’re subservient to the Times.” I’m probably phrasing that wrong. What is that like to sort of be someone who’s used to working for the institution ...

You sound like my therapist. Be successful, but not too successful. Or a mother.

But have you had a discussion with your editors or co-workers about that?

No, I think what you just said reflects a slight misunderstanding in the chronology and the growth of reporters as stars in their own right. I think that started a long time ago with the bylines, and with names that we all grew up reading. RW Apple, Adam McGurney, Maureen Dowd, they were breaking the mold of what it meant to be a star reporter with the voice that they used in their writing.

Then television happened, and a lot of my colleagues are such compelling storytellers in that medium as well, and I don’t know how they balance it all but they do, they are writing a story, breaking it on their way to the television studio where they’re on a show, and then they’re back at the office or they’re home reporting, this is the classic Maggie Haberman life story, kind of working non-stop and being a master of all those different mediums.

So there were many generations of those stars before me, and I think there will be a lot more after me.

I talked to Dean Kane at one of the events, he said, “We want to put pictures of our journalists next to their byline.”

Oh that’s interesting.

“We want to lean into that.” But that was last spring, and that hasn’t happened yet.

That’s a lot of real estate in the story.

It seemed like. He had a whole theory for why that would be good and help sort of validate the journalist.

I’ll tell you one thing it would be good for. It’s funny, I heard Samantha Bee say that she doesn’t look at her mentions on Twitter, which I have no such self control. But if you saw ...

People can at you.

Oh yeah. I’m very sensitive to the criticism. If you had the photo of a journalist, I think we would get a smaller volume of some of the feedback we get, because we’re human beings. I think, although Samantha’s on television, so I guess she would know better what it means to actually have your image out there. So it might not change all the negative feedback, but I’m struck sometimes by people’s inability to see that the journalist is just a person.

Yeah, because you’re just this disembodied thing, right?

I think audio’s changing that.

I have other questions for you, but I want to open this up to you guys. If you have questions, there’s a couple microphones, don’t be shy, Michael will talk. There’s a question right here.

Speaker 1: First of all, I want to say that the last time I think I cried listening to The Daily was the Rohinga story last week.

Thank you for listening to that.

Speaker 1: Which was just remarkable.

Really heartbreaking piece about what our reporter, who’s been in Myanmar, described of the refugees he’s spoken to, including a soldier killing a baby.

Speaker 1: Right. That was just, I almost had to pull over the car kind of thing.

We had a debate about how we could tell that story without basically shocking people. So we asked my colleague who told that story to sort of warn people. To say, “Before I tell you this story, I’m going to tell you a story that’s going to kill a part of you forever.”

Speaker 1: Well, it was very memorable. The other thing is, I heard you last week on longform and now you’re out here tonight, I’m just wondering is this a conscience thing? Are you doing press on purpose to try to drum up support, or just a coincidence?

No. Support for ...

Michael begged me to come onstage.

I didn’t. No, I think people are really interested in The Daily right now, and they’re interested in how journalism is done, and I think we’re really game to talk about it because we want people to listen to what we do. We work really long hours and we care about the stories, and we want to get as many people to listen as possible. No, this is not a press tour.

Speaker 1: Okay. Well Peter, it’s a real treat to have Michael here.

Let me be clear, I asked Michael and he said yes, and I’m delighted he came. Questions. Here, back here.

Speaker 2: Great, thank you. So first of all, it’s very strange to meet the man who talks to me in my shower every morning.

In the shower! So here’s the thing, there’s only one thing I’ve not been told people do The Daily to. I’ll let you be the judge.

Speaker 2: I’ll say that’s true here also. But something I’ve noticed, in the shower, is that there’s a real variety of pieces, right? I got hooked during the heady days of the ACA repeal efforts where you were talking to reporters in the Senate gallery, breaking news merely hours old. Then you’ve had these beautiful longform pieces on opioids and Myanmar and guns. Where do you see that headed? Do you have a vision of what The Daily’s going to look like in six months or a year? Is there a particular direction you personally would like to take it?

Well first of all, thank you for listening very much in the shower. I’ve so many more questions about that, but let’s just answer your original question.

I think that the news dictates a lot of what we’re capable of being at any moment, and if there’s a lot of news like what’s happening right now in Myanmar, or activity with the tax bill in Congress, we feel really compelled to deal with big breaking stories. The promise we have with the listener every day is that we’re going to tell you what you need to know.

Candidly, we’re constantly debating the definition of what need-to-know is. We increasingly believe that what you need to know is the human story of what it’s like to lose your job in a factory in Indiana, we think you need to know what’s going on inside the North Korean nuclear program, even if something didn’t happen that day. Sometimes we just have a really powerful story to tell. We think you need to know that just as much as you need to know what the president said. So we recalibrate that all the time, but if there is a big story like the James Comey, which absolutely blew up our show that week, and probably for the next week after, then we will always favor that.

Speaker 3: Big fan of the show, and I don’t listen in the shower, but I do listen every morning. I think that one of the challenges that your team probably faces inevitably is figuring out, in this immense amount of stories in the Trump administration and everything else, which to focus on and what will be most impactful for your listeners, and for the millions of people that are out there trying to figure out what to focus on for the day. So I would be interested in hearing how your team sorts through the noise, and what you focus on first and foremost in terms of what The Daily is about each day.

So I just want to say that the three people in front of you are very involved in all of this, and Lindsey Garrison there who made the extraordinary episode about Shannon who, the ball -bearing plant. Lisa Togin, who’s executive editor of NYT audio, and Samantha Heneg who’s editorial director. The Daily is truly ... I’m embarrassed at the assumptions that I am making a lot of these decisions, because we brainstorm constantly. We can spend two hours or more just thinking through what the show should be, what a segment should sound like.

I think what you hear in the show, and the quality that you pick up on, is a really obsessive approach to, what are the questions that we’re going to ask? Does the report have the right information? If they don’t, can we really beg them to just go out and do a little bit of thinking about something that we want to push them to be thinking about because it might not be something they’re actually reporting on.

So all those elements — is the reporter available, is the story powerful for audio, is there a lot of sound out there that we can play with? That’s a reality for us. If there’s congressional testimony, we’re such geeks, we watch a lot of congressional testimony. We watch a lot of speeches. We watch so you don’t have to, and we want to find a way to incorporate that. That’s very central, because the reason you’re going to understand something and feel it’s urgent and real is because there’s sound there. So that all goes into the decision making.

So it’s not just the story, it’s how can we tell this story, how can this story work in audio?

Oh yeah. I mean, it would be a pretty dry show if two reporters, a guest and I were just sitting there talking at each other. So production value is really, really important to us.

Kara, let’s not do the two reporters talking to each other that we were talking about.

We talk about the sort of crippling reality of the boring two-way, as it’s called. You would never let that happen.

One last here?

Speaker 4: Hi. I’m a big fan, I’ve also cried listening to The Daily, many times. One episode I cried at was the assisted suicide episode.

Lindsey Garrison.

Speaker 4: Where it’s actually in, at this living like, as this person died, and you listen to the die, and it was just so powerful. I was thinking during that episode and during several others that are clearly accompanying these big prestigious Times pieces that are really deeply reported. Are you working with the reporters early on?

Yes.

Speaker 4: To give them audio training and for ambiant sound, and how have you communicated that across the organization, and what’s that process like?

We try to link up as early as possible with those big pieces of journalism, and the editors who edit those kinds of stories are very specialized, the journalists are very skilled, and we try to talk to them, in some cases, in the case of the assisted suicide story, I believe we were talking to them, I believe a couple months ahead of time, and it was actually somebody from the video department at the time who was collecting audio that whole time. We worked with her, so yeah, you can’t wait till a story comes in and say, “Oh could you ...” Especially a story like that, you need to be really present. So we have to coordinate a lot.

That was a story that absolutely devastated everybody who touched it. That episode, we almost don’t talk about it unless we know we’re in a place where we know we’re safe enough to almost be emotional because it was so profound, so I’m so glad you liked it.

When a new Times reporter gets their first A1 story, they get a plate, right?

That’s true.

What do you get for your first Daily podcast feature?

Pat on the back.

You guys need a tchotchke or something.

Well, we have some merchandise that we’re developing.

Okay, we’ll work on that.

I think, I’m totally, totally pushing this now, but I think, Samantha how soon? Eventually you can go to the New York Times store and get some of this merchandise.

All right, we always try to break new here, so we broke an important merchandising news.

Big important news.

Michael, this is great, thank you so much.

Thank you. Thank you so much, Peter.

Thank you."
Eric Johnson,“Sticky Fingers” author Joe Hagan says his new biography of Wenner ends on a “tragic” note for both the man and his groundbreaking magazine.,2017-11-02T10:30:02Z,recode,How Rolling Stone co-founder Jann Wenner built and lost a rock-and-roll empire,https://www.recode.net/2017/11/2/16594392/rolling-stone-jann-wenner-sticky-fingers-joe-hagan-biography-recode-media-peter-kafka-podcast,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGxil7eTWqiyKve_vZ27JXg3SFY=/0x379:1991x1421/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9586933/474017104.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"In 1967, Jann Wenner loaded himself into a slingshot and fired himself across the next half-century of pop culture. In the new book “Sticky Fingers,” biographer Joe Hagan chronicles how Wenner created Rolling Stone magazine and became the gatekeeper of rock music — and eventually, all pop culture.

“To get a magazine in the mail, that was the entire internet,” Hagan said on the latest episode of Recode Media with Peter Kafka. “You’d get a record at the record store, you would go over the liner notes, and whatever else it said on it, and that was as much as you were going to know about these guys. [Rolling Stone] was the entire universe delivered on a platter.”

Wenner’s genius was taking rock music seriously, at a time when no one else was.

“He was able to package and kind of define a culture that had, up to that point, not been defined,” Hagan said. “It looked like a newspaper that your parents would get, except it had stoners in it. So this was like a revelation. If you’re 18 and you want to listen to Iron Butterfly, here's your magazine.”

You can listen to Recode Media on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

It’s been a long time since Rolling Stone had a monopoly on culture, and now Wenner is leaving the business, well past the print era’s prime and having made crucial mistakes.

Even though Wenner proposed Hagan’s biography and cooperated with him for four years, opening his extensive archives of personal letters and memorabilia (“He saved every last shred of toilet paper”), he then publicly denounced the book and distanced himself from Hagan. The issue was that, rather than lionizing Wenner, Hagan delved into those business mistakes, as well as Wenner’s sexual and narcotic escapades, producing a book that Wenner called “tawdry.”

One of the sources of Wenner’s mistakes was the internet, which — like many print publishers — he ignored until it was too late.

“A lot of getting successful in this business or any other is being willing to try and fail, and then try and fail again, and see how much risk taking you’re ready to do,” Hagan said. “But he didn’t see [the internet], he saw a black hole there, and he wasn’t going to go there.”

And then there were the bigger errors: Wenner had an opportunity to trade control of Rolling Stone for 25 percent of MTV in the early 1980s, but didn’t. In 2006, he took out a $300 million loan to buy back control of Us Magazine from Disney, right as the print business was about to tumble off a cliff. And when Hearst offered to buy his empire in a deal that could have made him a billionaire, he passed.

Since then, Wenner has had to sell Men's Journal, Us Magazine and half of the ownership of Rolling Stone. Now he’s in the process of selling the other half.

“Do you want to be as rich as God and have a ton of money?” Hagan asked. “Can you let go of this thing? In a way, it’s such a ... Shakespearean moment for me. It kind of plays that way in the book. What we’re seeing since then is the result of that decision. It’s got a tragic element to it.”

During a speech to the environmental group Conservation International in Culver City, Calif., where he was receiving an award, Ford said the biggest threat to the United States is leaders that don't understand or accept evidence that human activity is driving rapid climate change.

""We face an unprecedented moment in this country. Today’s greatest threat is not climate change, not pollution, not flood or fire,"" Ford said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ""It’s that we’ve got people in charge of important shit who don’t believe in science.""

Ford, an outspoken and longtime advocate for environmental causes, cast the threat posed by climate change as a dire one in his speech, arguing that unless it is addressed quickly, ""nothing else will matter.""

""If we don’t stop the destruction of nature, nothing else will matter,"" Ford said, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

""Jobs won’t matter, our economies won’t matter, our freedoms and ethics won’t matter, our children’s education and potential won’t matter, peace, prosperity. If we end the ability of a healthy natural world to sustain humanity nothing else will matter, simply said.""

President Trump himself has cast doubt on climate change, once calling it a ""hoax"" propagated by the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing less competitive. In June, he announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the 195-nation Paris climate accord, which seeks to drastically curb carbon emissions."

About 600 men have barricaded themselves inside the camp on remote Manus island in Papua New Guinea, defying efforts by Australia and PNG to shut it. Food, running water and medical services were cut off by Australia five days ago.

Australian authorities want the men moved to a transit center elsewhere on the island at the start of a process the asylum seekers fear will result in them being resettled in PNG or another developing nation. The men also fear violent reprisals from the local community.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday her country was willing to take 150 asylum seekers from among those held on Manus island and another camp on the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru.

Her Australian counterpart, Malcolm Turnbull, however said Canberra preferred to work through an existing refugee swap deal he negotiated with former U.S. President Barack Obama last year. Under that deal, up to 1,250 asylum seekers could be sent to the United States and Australia will in turn accept refugees from Central America.

“We want to pursue those, conclude those arrangements, and then in the wake of that obviously we can consider other ones,” Turnbull told Ardern during a media conference in Sydney.

Relocating the men on Manus island is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of asylum seekers.

Ardern acknowledged the two Tasman neighbors faced different immigration problems but said the offer remained open.

The camps on Manus island and Nauru have been key parts of Australia’s disputed “Sovereign Borders” immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores.

Australia’s offshore detention policies have been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups but are backed the center-right government and the Labor opposition.

U.N. rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news conference in Geneva on Friday about the “unfolding humanitarian emergency” in the Manus island center, where asylum seekers have been reported digging wells to try to find water."

The official, who declined to be identified under briefing rules, said billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who owns investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, and former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf had been detained.

Neither man nor Kingdom Holding officials could be reached immediately for comment. Aside from being one of the largest shareholders in Citigroup C.N, Kingdom owns stakes in Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp (NWSA.O) and microblogging site Twitter.

Saudi King Salman announced late on Saturday the creation of a new anti-corruption committee chaired by his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said the body had detained 11 princes, four current ministers and tens of former ministers.

The crown prince is spearheading an ambitious economic reform program that aims to draw more foreign and private sector investment into the kingdom, which is the world’s top oil exporter and the most powerful country in the Gulf Arab region.

King Salman also appointed two new ministers on Saturday to key security and economic posts, removing one of the royal family’s most prominent members as head of the National Guard.

Prince Miteb bin Abdullah was replaced as minister of the National Guard by Khaled bin Ayyaf, while Economy Minister Adel Fakieh was removed in favor of his deputy Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, according to a royal decree carried by state-run media.

Prince Miteb, the preferred son of the late King Abdullah, was once thought to be a leading contender for the throne before the unexpected rise of Prince Mohammed two years ago.

The Cabinet reshuffle helped to consolidate Prince Mohammed’s control of the kingdom’s security institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Prince Mohammed, who has pledged to go after graft at the highest levels, will head the new anti-corruption body, which was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and freeze assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said."

Trump hailed the “good chemistry” of the sunny summit in Florida and predicted “lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away.”

The “bromance” is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trump’s visit starting on Wednesday. Xi has grown more powerful since their last meeting, while Trump is under a political cloud after his former campaign manager was indicted in an intensifying investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Chinese experts say Beijing has learned to manage Trump, a real-estate mogul who had never held elective office before becoming president, and whose administration in its first 10 months has been turbulent.

“China has an objective view of him. We’re going to make him feel comfortable,” said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. “He may end up being re-elected. We need to look at this from a long-term perspective, and not view him as an ‘other’ or a joke.”

Trump clearly respects Xi.

In a congratulatory phone call, Trump hailed the “extraordinary elevation” of Xi, whose political thoughts were enshrined in the Communist Party’s constitution last month during a congress marking the start of his second term.

Aboard Air Force One on his way to Asia, Trump cited record stock market levels, low unemployment and Islamic State “virtually defeated in the Middle East” as evidence of his own success.

“(Xi) knows that and he respects that,” Trump said, adding trade is still an irritant in ties.

“I think he’s viewing us as very, very strong and also very friendly. Look we have to do better with trade with China because it’s a one way street right now. It has been for many years. And we will.”

‘STATE-PLUS’

China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said Trump will receive a “state visit-plus” experience in Beijing.

It’s unclear what the “plus” means. Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details. The protocol will let Trump “rejoice in grandiosity”, important to keeping relations stable, said Teng Jianqun, head of American Studies at Foreign Ministry think-tank China Institute for International Studies.

“We must seize upon his special characteristics, such as liking instant gratification, and set up some things that bring immediate results,” he said.

On the commercial front, that means a slew of deals - and worries among some in the U.S. business community that the transactional Trump will be placated by a handful of contract wins instead of resolving long-standing complaints over discriminatory Chinese policies and market access restrictions. [L4N1N304G]

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told reporters on Friday that China would “create a good atmosphere” with informal activities for the two presidents, so they have ample time to talk about important issues.

Zheng said that at the April summit, Trump and his wife Melania had extended an “extremely warm, friendly and thoughtful” reception to Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan. “The Chinese people demand that courtesy be repaid in kind,” he said.

Trump is a popular figure for many in China, who admire his business acumen; he is not the divisive figure he is in the United States and its allies in Europe and elsewhere.

The WeChat account of the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily marked China’s announcement of his visit with a picture of a beaming Trump and the headline “Trump’s coming!”

STARK CONTRAST

A contrast between the two presidents was set at the start of the year.

Days ahead of Trump taking office, Xi was the keynote speaker at the World Economic Forum in Davos, offering a vigorous defense of globalization. Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership his first week in office, distancing America from its Asian allies.

One Beijing-based Western diplomat said Xi’s strong and confident vision for China contrasts with perceptions that Trump often seems to pick arguments.

But not with China. Trump in office put aside his grievances about China’s trade and currency practices, aired vociferously during the campaign, to get China behind his strategy of punishing sanctions on North Korea for its escalating missile and nuclear tests.

And Beijing accommodated him when he grew frustrated.

Days after Trump’s Sept. 4 tweet that the United States was considering “stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,” Beijing ordered North Korean companies operating within its borders to shut down, banned its exports of textiles and reduced China’s oil exports to the North.

But with North Korea occupying most of the Trump administration’s attention in Asia, China’s construction of military facilities on artificial islands in disputed waters of the South China Sea has seemingly fallen off the radar. Beijing does still get irritated about U.S. navy “freedom of navigation” patrols there, which have continued under Trump.

“Trump is very popular with the (Chinese) military,” said a Chinese official with ties to the military, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It’s great for China that the United States is in chaos. It means we don’t have to worry about them challenging us.”

Trump’s 12-day trip to Asia – the longest by a U.S. president in a quarter-century - will give him a chance to reassure friends and allies in the region, who have expressed uncertainty about his “America First” policies.

Tillerson has already signaled the limits of Washington’s patience with China.

Ahead of a trip to India last month, Tillerson said that “China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly, at times undermining the international, rules-based order,“ and he criticized China for its “predatory economics” and its ”provocative actions in the South China Sea”.

At last month’s party congress, Xi laid out a vision for a prosperous and assertive China taking a bigger place on the global stage.

The congress left China with “greater confidence and lung power, more unhurried in its dealings with the United States,” Wang Wen, president of Renmin University’s Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, wrote in a front page commentary on Friday in the overseas edition of the People’s Daily."

Trump kicked off a 12-day Asian trip and is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.

He told reporters on Air Force One en route to Asia that North Korea would figure prominently in discussions during the trip. He also singled out trade, which he said had been “badly handled” in the region for years.

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

A top aide said last week Trump intends to tell Asian leaders the world is “running out of time” in dealing with the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.

“No dictator, no regime, no nation should ever underestimate American resolve,” Trump told hundreds of cheering U.S. and Japanese troops in camouflage uniforms gathered at Yokota Air Base, just west of Tokyo, soon after he arrived.

“Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it?” said Trump, who wore a bomber jacket as he addressed the troops.

North Korea’s recent actions, including several missiles that flew over Japan and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test, have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Recent drills over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have further heightened tensions.

“We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defense of our freedom,” Trump said.

He told reporters earlier on Air Force One that a decision would be made soon on whether to add reclusive North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Trump said his administration planned to take a different approach after years of what he termed “total weakness.”

“We want to get it solved. It’s a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved.”

In an apparent attempt to distinguish between North Korea’s leadership and ordinary people, he said he thought North Koreans were “great people.”

“And I hope it all works out for everybody.”

GOLF DIPLOMACY

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters before Trump’s arrival that he welcomed the visit as a chance to deepen bilateral ties by building upon the “friendship and trust” between the two leaders, fostered by several meetings that included a round of golf in Florida earlier this year.

Slideshow (20 Images)

“I hope we will be able to have thorough discussions about international issues, including North Korea,” he said.

Trump and Abe greeted each other with a handshake at a golf course to be used during the 2020 Olympic games, changing clothes and heading out to play after what media said was a lunch of hamburgers. In an allusion to a Trump campaign slogan, they signed ball caps that said “Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.”

Trump also said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, the longest Asian tour by any U.S. leader since George H.W. Bush in 1992.

“I think it’s expected that we will meet,” he said. “We want Putin’s help on North Korea.”

Trump wants a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before he visits Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to policies more favorable to the United States, a point Trump emphasized.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where he will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.

The king also announced the creation of a new anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman which Al Arabiya TV said had already detained 11 princes, four current ministers and tens of former ministers. The suspects were not named.

The cabinet reshuffle saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah replaced as minister of the National Guard by Khaled bin Ayyaf, while Economy Minister Adel Fakieh was removed in favor of his deputy Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, according to a royal decree carried by state-run media.

Prince Miteb, the preferred son of the late King Abdullah, was once thought to be a leading contender for the throne before the unexpected rise of Prince Mohammed two years ago.

He had inherited control of the National Guard, an elite internal security force built out of traditional tribal units, from his father, who ran it for five decades.

Prince Miteb was the last remaining member of Abdullah’s branch of the family to hold a position in the upper echelons of the Saudi power structure.

The move consolidates Crown Prince Mohammed’s control of the kingdom’s security institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Prince Mohammed, the king’s 32-year-old son, already serves as defense minister and was named heir to the throne in a June reshuffle that sidelined his older cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef who had also served as interior minister.

He has been responsible at the same time for running Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, dictating an energy policy with global implications and behind the plans for the kingdom to build a future after oil.

Prince Mohammed, who has pledged to go after graft at the highest levels, will now also head up the new anti-corruption body, which was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and freeze assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

NEW ECONOMY MINISTER

The country’s new economy minister, Tuwaijri, is a former Saudi air force pilot and former chief executive of HSBC’s Middle East operations who has led the economy ministry’s program to privatize some $200 billion of government assets.

He replaces Fakieh, who served as the point man for the kingdom’s wide-ranging economic reforms since his appointment as economy and planning minister in 2015.

A former food executive with a reputation for pushing through politically sensitive reforms, Fakieh had previously served as labor minister, health minister and mayor of Jeddah.

Fakieh faced down fierce opposition from the business community as labor minister when he established quotas for foreign workers to boost jobs for Saudis.

Under Prince Mohammed, Fakieh led the development of a national transformation plan and privatization drive launched last year to end the kingdom’s vulnerability to an unpredictable oil market. His replacement comes as the kingdom makes adjustments to that plan, a process dubbed NTP 2.0.

The royal decree did not say whether Fakieh would hold any other government position. Former ministers often serve in advisory roles after leaving their posts."

Trump, who is on a 12-day trip, is to speak to U.S. and Japanese forces at Yokota air base shortly after arriving in Japan on Sunday and looked to stress the importance of the alliance to regional security.

Ballistic missile tests by North Korea and its sixth and largest nuclear test, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, have exacerbated the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Aerial drills conducted over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have raised tensions in recent days.

In a display of golf diplomacy, Trump is to play a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The two leaders also played together in Florida earlier this year.

Trump will also have a state call with the Imperial Family at Akasaka Palace during his visit. Abe and Trump will meet families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.

Joined by his wife Melania on part of the trip, Trump’s tour of Asia is the longest by an American president since George H.W. Bush in 1992. Besides Japan, he will visit South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Trump departed Hawaii for Japan aboard Air Force One shortly before 7:27 a.m. Hawaii time (1727 GMT).

En route to Hawaii’s Hickham Air Force Base, Trump’s motorcade stopped briefly at the Trump International Hotel Waikiki.

”It has been a tremendously successful project and he wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.

Trump extended the trip by a day on Friday when he agreed to participate in a summit of East Asian nations in Manila.

His trip got off to a colorful start in Hawaii. He was taken by boat out to the USS Arizona Memorial, where lies the World War Two ship that was sunk by the Japanese during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941.

The Trumps tossed white flower petals into the waters at the memorial in honor of those who died at Pearl Harbor.

TRADE, NORTH KOREA

Trump’s trip is to be dominated by trade and how to muster more international pressure on North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.

“We’ll be talking about trade,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “We’ll be talking about obviously North Korea. We’ll be enlisting the help of a lot of people and countries and we’ll see what happens. But I think we’re going to have a very successful trip. There is a lot of good will.”

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster, briefing reporters on Friday, defended Trump’s colorful language.

“What’s inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what they’re doing to threaten the world,” McMaster said.

Trump will seek a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before visiting Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to trade policies more favorable to the United States.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where he will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies."

Manafort, who ran Trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year, and associate Richard Gates earlier this week pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment by a federal grand jury.

The charges include conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. They are part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election in Trump’s favor and potential collusion by Trump associates.

In the Saturday court filing, Manafort offered to limit his travel to New York, Washington and Florida and pledged life insurance worth about $4.5 million as well as about $8 million in real estate assets, including a property on Fifth Avenue in New York that was identified by some media outlets as an apartment in Trump Tower.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said on Thursday that initial bail terms would remain in place and set a bail hearing for Monday to consider changes. On Friday, she suggested a potential May 7 trial date.

Manafort and Gates are under house arrest, under unsecured bonds of $10 million and $5 million, respectively, which means they do not have to post the bail unless they fail to show up for court or violate other conditions.

Prosecutors have argued there is a risk of flight and both men are subject to electronic monitoring.

As part of the indictment, the special counsel’s office is seeking forfeiture of four of Manafort’s properties in connection with money laundering charges.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on Saturday.

Manafort, 68, in the filing also explained why he had three different U.S. passports, a fact noted by prosecutors. Manafort’s lawyer, Kevin Downing, rejected suggestions that Manafort was a “Jason Bourne character” - referencing a fictitious, globe-trotting, rogue covert agent.

“The facts are much more mundane,” Downing wrote.

Manafort had two passports, including one for submitting to foreign governments to receive visas while traveling on the other, his lawyers said. He was issued a third passport because one had been lost and Manafort contacted passport services to advise them it was found.

Downing also wrote that funds Manafort had deposited in accounts on the island of Cyprus were legal and now had only “nominal” balances. Prosecutors said Manafort and Gates used numerous entities to transmit more than $18 million from Ukraine through Cyprus and eventually to the United States.

Federal prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday that Manafort’s financial assets were substantial, but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from $19 million to $136 million.

The investigation has cast a shadow over the first nine months of the Trump presidency. For Manafort and Gates, a conviction on conspiracy to launder money alone could carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison."

The announcement marks the latest failed attempt to combine the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, as Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), show unwillingness to part with too much of their prized U.S. telecom assets.

A combined company would have had more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N).

The failed merger could also help keep wireless prices low as all four providers have been heavily discounting their cellphone plans in a battle for consumers.

“Consumers are better off without the merger because Sprint and T-Mobile will continue to compete fiercely for budget-conscious customers,” said Erik Gordon, a Ross School of Business professor at the University of Michigan.

The companies’ unusual step of making a joint announcement on the canceled negotiations could indicate they still recognize the merits of a merger, keeping the door open for potential future talks.

Sprint and T-Mobile said they ended talks because the companies “were unable to find mutually agreeable terms.”

John Legere, chief executive of T-Mobile, said in the statement that the prospect of combining with Sprint was compelling, but “we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding standalone performance and track record.”

Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said that even though the companies could not reach a deal, “we certainly recognize the benefits of scale through a potential combination.”

Claure also said Sprint has agreed it is best to move forward on its own with its assets “including our rich spectrum holdings, and are accelerating significant investments in our network to ensure our continued growth.”

SPRINT‘S ROAD AHEAD

Failure to clinch an agreement leaves SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, a dealmaker who raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, needing to find another option for Sprint.

Sprint is in the middle of a turnaround plan and has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs. But industry analysts have expressed concern that the company, weighed down with total debt of $38 billion, has few financial options.

Even though its customer base has expanded under CEO Claure, growth has been driven by heavy discounting. Analysts said an end to talks with T-Mobile would leave debt-laden Sprint without the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.

Sprint has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs and mortgaging a portion of its airwaves and equipment.

Mark Stodden, telecom analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said about Sprint: “To really take the kind of next step from a business that has been stabilized to a business that has been growing is going to require a new more intense investment phase.”

T-Mobile is in a better position as a standalone company, analysts have said.

T-Mobile, controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom which owns roughly 65 percent, became the first major carrier to eliminate two-year contracts - a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans.

Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Höttges said in a statement on Saturday that T-Mobile has a “strong basis for growth in the upcoming years.”

MONTHS OF TALKS

Both companies had expressed interest in a tie-up this year. SoftBank was prepared to give up control to do a deal with T-Mobile, sources familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters in February. But no deal was announced immediately following the conclusion of a ban on merger talks in the spring that was associated with a U.S. government auction of wireless airwaves.

Both Sprint and T-Mobile said they were open to exploring other options.

An added wrinkle was Sprint’s negotiations with cable companies Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O).

A source told Reuters in July that SoftBank was considering an acquisition offer for Charter in a deal where it would combine the cable company with Sprint.

The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014, but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

Industry executives have said a combined Sprint-T-Mobile entity would have the scale, network and enhanced portfolio of wireless airwaves and a better chance to develop 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.

Even if T-Mobile and Sprint had agreed on merger terms, they would have faced major challenges convincing antitrust regulators that their deal should be approved.

“This is good news for consumers - a potential merger by T-Mobile and Sprint could have raised serious antitrust issues,” Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement."

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he raised the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to sell about 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest initial public offer ever.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition among New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment.

NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also received some government support for its bid, although that has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

While Trump’s tweet named the New York Stock Exchange, it did not mention rival Nasdaq Inc, which is also vying for the Aramco listing.

“Generally, public servants should be impartial, not give preferential treatment to anyone, and avoid endorsements,” said Scott Amey, general counsel for the government ethics watchdog Project on Government Oversight in Washington. “We have already seen violations in this administration, and it doesn’t help that the president isn’t leading by example.”

Nasdaq replied to Trump in a tweet, saying it agreed the United States was the “best destination for global companies” but that Aramco belongs on Nasdaq “with the 5 most valuable operating companies in the world.”

AWAITING A DECISION

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials say they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA. Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has been an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

Still, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. Saudi leaders welcomed him warmly during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against their nation’s diplomatic archrival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

“President Trump’s tweet indicates that, from the White House’s perspective at least, a public listing of Aramco is not as dead as some recent reports indicated,” said Bob McNally, president of Washington-based energy market and policy consultant Rapidan Energy Group.

“The tweet suggests the White House believes Saudi Arabia may be approaching a decision on where to list and wishes to either claim credit or push a possibly wavering Saudi Arabia for a New York listing,” McNally added.

Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock. The prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings, including IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil."

The Hammers suffered another painful loss at the London Stadium to pile further pressure on the Croatian coach, who is without a league win in four games.

West Ham currently sit one point above the relegation places and have lost three out of their last four home league games against Tottenham, Brighton and Liverpool.

And Bilic acknowledged his position is growing more vulnerable with each negative result his side collects.

“I know the situation better than anyone because I live that situation,” Bilic told talkSPORT.

“It’s not new and it didn’t start yesterday, so I have to prepare for that [losing his job].

“I have always said that West Ham is above everyone and every individual. The club has to do whatever is necessary – and we’ll see what they’re going to do.

“I can ease that pressure with good results, good performances, good wins, which was maybe when we beat Huddersfield, but when we lost against Brighton it [pressure] came back again.""

Co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan are expected to hold further talks with Bilic, following reports he had fixtures against Tottenham and Crystal Palace to save his job.

But despite losing neither encounter, the nature of another heavy home defeat could end up costing Bilic his job at the London Stadium.

Asked if he would be speaking to Gold and Sullivan, Bilic added: “Definitely.

“We don’t have a discussion about the future. I can’t say anything negative in my two-and-a-half season relationship with the chairmen and with the vice-chairman.

“I talk to them after every game and, of course, when we are cruising they are flying and when we are losing they are supportive.

“But also we talk about the situation and we mentioned this game and we needed to get something out of it – but we didn’t get anything.”"

Quickfire first-half goals from Mohamed Salah and Joel Matip saw the hapless Hammers booed off at the interval.

Manuel Lanzini pulled one back in the second half but less than a minute later Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain extinguished their hopes of a comeback before Salah hit an exquisite fourth.

And while there remains no real appetite to sack Bilic among the West Ham hierarchy, it is hard to see how he can continually stagger on to the next 'must-win' game to save his job.

The Croatian has just survived two of those, against Tottenham and last weekend's last-gasp draw at Crystal Palace, and this loss sharpens the focus once more.

For Liverpool it was certainly a happier trip to the capital than their last one, the 4-1 Wembley defeat by Tottenham a fortnight ago.

It could have all been so different, though, had West Ham taken the glorious chance which came their way after nine minutes.

Lanzini's ball over the top, with the aid of a deflection, fell at the feet of Andre Ayew.

With Simon Mignolet a little slow to come out, Ayew lifted the ball over the goalkeeper only to see his effort hit the outside of the near post.

But in the 22nd minute it was the Reds who went ahead - straight from a West Ham corner.

After Mark Noble's cross was headed clear Salah clipped the ball to Sadio Mane and the duo charged upfield.

Mane was a surprise inclusion in the starting line-up having made a quicker than expected recovery from a hamstring problem.

The Senegal striker was certainly showing no ill-effects from the injury as he hared the length of the field unchallenged.

Mane reached the edge of the West Ham penalty and, with only Aaron Cresswell for company, squared for Salah to roll the ball past Joe Hart.

It was a devastating counter-attack and left the hosts shell-shocked after their bright start.

But things got worse two and a half minutes later when Salah's corner hit Noble, forcing Hart to make a save.

The England keeper could only parry the ball straight to Matip, who buried the rebound before a West Ham defender could react.

Bilic, now relying on the sort of second-half display which saw his side come from two down to beat Spurs in the Carabao Cup last week, turned to Andy Carroll for inspiration.

And when Lanzini held off a weak challenge from Joe Gomez at the far post before tucking in Ayew's cross, the fightback looked as though it might be on.

That hope lasted all of 55 seconds, though, as Liverpool merely sauntered up the other end with Roberto Firmino teeing up Oxlade-Chamberlain for his first Premier League goal for the Reds.

Salah wrapped up the scoring - and sparked another exodus of angry punters at the London Stadium- when he collected Mane's pass on the corner of the area and expertly placed his shot past Hart for number four."

Southampton 0-1 Burnley:

Burnley continued their best-ever start to a Premier League season and are now level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea after a 1-0 win away at Southampton.

An 81st minute header from substitute Sam Vokes which sealed the victory – the Welshman nodding in Johann Berg Gudmundsson’s cross to maintain Burnley’s unbeaten home record this season.

It was another defensive masterclass frim Sean Dyche’s side as they soaked up pressure from the hosts throughout the game.

Southampton had both a greater share of possession and more shots on goal, but Burnley left it late to complete and smash-and-grab three points with their only shot on target.

They rise to sixth in the table – level on 18 points with both fourth-placed Chelsea and fifth-placed Arsenal.

Huddersfield 1-0 West Brom:

Huddersfield managed to hold on with ten men to register a brilliant 1-0 victory over West Brom.

Dutch forward Rajiv van La Parra got the game-winning goal for the Terriers on the stroke of half-time, finding the top corner with a stunning curling shot from 20 yards.

Huddersfield weren dealt a blow and West Brom a gift when defender Christopher Schindler was sent off for a second booking in the 57th minute.

But the Baggies failed to make their advantage count, with Salomon Rondon heading their best chance agonisingly wide of the post, and Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl producing two fine saves to deny James McClean and Matt Phillips in injury-time.

The defeat increases pressure on manager Tony Pulis, with the side now only two points above the relegation zones after a run of nine games without a win.

Newcastle 0-1 Bournemouth:

Steve Cook headed a 90th-minute winner to lift Bournemouth out of the relegation zone and condemn Newcastle to a home defeat.

In a scrappy match at St James’ Park, as the Magpies wasted a host of chances – former Bournemouth star Matt Richie hitting the post from long-range and Dwight Gayle also wasting a great chance.

Bournemouth were close to a breakthrough when Marc Pugh hit the post late on, before Cook thumped in a late corner to hand the Cherries all three points.

Swansea 0-1 Brighton:

Glenn Murray’s early goal led Brighton to victory at Swansea – extending the Seagulls’ unbeaten run to four games and leaving the hosts in the relegation zone.

The visitors were gifted their goal as Swansea's Federico Fernandez ducked out of the way of a cross, allowing Glenn Murray to nudge the ball in with his thigh.

The home team were booed off by their own fans at half-time and did their best to appease them after the break, with Tammy Abraham forcing a smart save from Mat Ryan.

But the Swans were uninspired and unimaginative in attack, and did little to trouble Brighton’s solid defences, as they were beaten for the fifth time in six home league games this season.

Substitute Sam Vokes claimed the late winner against his hometown club to leave high-flying Burnley with 11 points from their opening six away games of the campaign.

""To be honest, the story's come around and it's out of my hands. It's a story that's away from me, although it's about me at the moment,"" said Dyche, who took over at Turf Moor in 2012.

""I just keep getting on with my business, as I have been doing for five years.

""I've had numerous times when I've been linked with situations and I just continue to see it clearly and that is to work hard at what I do.

""I continue to do that and the group that I work with quite obviously today have done that again, so the rest of it is noise that's beyond me.

""There's not a story there. My story is the Burnley story; five years here, another win today, which is a fantastic win, a clean sheet, Southampton away, a place that's been historically very, very tough for us to come and get results - both me as a manager and the club - and we've won 1-0, that's the story."""

The Toffees are yet to replace Ronald Koeman, who was sacked two weeks ago, and Clarets boss Dyche is a frontrunner for the job.

But, with The Times reporting a two-part BBC Panorama programme about the club’s ownership is set to air, Barton believes he may be unwilling to put himself in a difficult situation and choose to sit tight instead.

“Everton are a club in a bit of a mess at this moment in time,” he said on Matchday Live.

“There is going to be a BBC Panorama programme on Sunday and Monday night which is about something which has gone on in the background of the club, in terms of who owns it. Usually if you get a Panorama interview done on you it’s not for positivity.

“I’m a mad keen Evertonian myself and this is not a great time for the football club. I don’t know what the programme is going to show but it doesn’t look great.

“If you’re Sean Dyche at Burnley, you know there are going to be job opportunities going forward. Burnley are a fantastically run football club and he’s a massive part of that. So is this the right time to go?

“Everton is a fantastic job to get but is it the job Sean Dyche would want to take at this moment in time? They’re in a relegation fight and there are issues on and off the pitch. Knowing the man as I do, he’s very much a risk averse guy and he likes to take his time over everything. He’s not one to jump at opportunities. He knows his quality and everybody is seeing that.

“I think he may well sit tight and ride out this Everton overture and he might wait for a better opportunity when he can get the chance to delve into the transfer market and put his stamp on a team in the summer. I think Burnley fans would wish him well if he left in the summer to another Premier League club.

“He knows his quality and he will be on a good wedge at Burnley, no doubt about it, although not the money he would get at one of the bigger clubs. At some point in time, though, it is going to happen. He’s a top class manager. For me, he’s the best I’ve worked with by a distance. It’s inevitable he’s going to go onto bigger and better things. If you do have quality then you are not looking to jump and move too quickly.

“He knows he has got a fantastic job at Burnley and they’re sitting seventh in the Premier League. How long can it be maintained? The future will show us that but why not wait to get a job at the start of a season where you can get your own culture and your own ethos stamped on a club. You’re going to take on someone else’s problems now.

“I think if Everton can get Sean Dyche through the door they’ve done incredibly well.

“He’s a modern day version of what David Moyes did to them. He would be a fantastic appointment for Everton.

“The difficulty lies, knowing the man as I do, in the off the pitch stuff could spook him and maybe make him sit tight and wait for a different opportunity.”"

Sheffield Wednesday tore up the form book to claim a shock 2-1 Championship win over Aston Villa and record only their second away victory of the season.

Adam Reach set the visitors on their way with the opening goal after only 19 seconds and fellow former Middlesbrough man Jordan Rhodes made it two before the break.

Chris Samba's last-minute reply was too little, too late for Villa, who also lost John Terry to injury.

Steve Bruce's side went into the game with six wins from their previous eight games, but never recovered from their nightmare start.

Barnsley 2-0 Birmingham City

Harvey Barnes shone again for Barnsley as they continued their improved form by beating struggling Birmingham 2-0 at Oakwell.

The Tykes headed into the game on the back of a morale-boosting midweek victory over Burton, and Tom Bradshaw struck early on after good work from Barnes to pick up where they had left off.

The visitors rarely posed a serious threat and Zeki Fryers condemned them to their second 2-0 defeat in four days, after a loss to Brentford on Wednesday, with a well-taken free-kick.

Barnsley's convincing win moves them up to 16th place in the Sky Bet Championship. The outcome leaves Birmingham still without an away win since the final game of last season, without a goal in their last four games, and sitting in the relegation zone.

Bolton Wanderers 2-0 Norwich City

Improving Bolton, unbeaten in October, kicked off November with a 2-1 Skybet Championship victory over Norwich at the Macron Stadium.

Strikers Gary Madine and Adam Armstrong struck in the last 10 minutes of the opening period to make it five games without defeat for Phil Parkinson's Trotters.

Wanderers, who had thrown away six points in their previous three games, remain in the relegation zone. However, nine points from a possible 15 have lifted them off bottom before Sunderland's game against Middlesbrough on Sunday.

Derby County 2-4 Reading

Reading tore up the form book and Derby's hopes of a fifth consecutive win when they claimed a shock 4-2 victory at Pride Park.

The Championship strugglers were always in control after Liam Moore and Sone Aluko scored in the first 13 minutes and Roy Beerens made it three before Johnny Russell pulled one back.

Modou Barrow scored a fourth and although Chris Martin replied in the 90th minute, Reading had done enough.

Ipswich Town 3-0 Preston North End

Ipswich climbed to seventh in the Championship table after condemning Preston to a fourth straight defeat in the Sky Bet Championship match at Portman Road.

A direct free kick by Martyn Waghorn in first-half stoppage time, a David McGoldrick,header and a wonder strike by Bersant Celina ensured victory for the hosts.

Millwall 0-1 Burton Albion

Marvin Sordell's second goal of the season saw Burton Albion beat 10-man Millwall 1-0 to record their first away win in the Championship since April.

A poor contest turned when Millwall winger Jed Wallace was shown a contentious red card on the hour for a foul on Tom Flanagan on the halfway line.

The mood of an angry home crowd soured on 70 minutes when Sordell netted with Burton's first shot of the match, which proved sufficient to bring Nigel Clough's side out of the bottom three.

Nottingham Forest 4-0 Queens Park Rangers

QPR's nightmare run at the City Ground was maintained in emphatic fashion as Nottingham Forest romped to a 4-0 success - ensuring an unwanted Football League record for Ian Holloway's men.

The Hoops have never won at Forest - and never looked likely to - as Mark Warburton's men cruised to a victory inspired by two goals from Tyler Walker and a rampaging performance from Barrie McKay.

QPR have now failed to win in 34 visits to the City Ground - including 29 games in the league, which is now officially the worst run of form of any Football League side, at any one venue, eclipsing Grimsby who have failed to win in 28 visits to Blackburn Rovers.

Marseille condemned the player’s action, which is likely to result in a hefty suspension, but also insisted there was ‘unacceptable behaviour on the part of a handful of provocateurs who uttered particularly serious hateful attacks against the player’.

Cascarino, though, has insisted Evra, 36, is unlikely to play for the club again during his career.

“I don’t know the full story but it must have been pretty serious for Patrice [Evra] to react. It’s obviously got to an incredibly serious level,” he told the Weekend Sports Breakfast.

“I’m not condoning what Eric Cantona did but he did it to an away fan who was giving him brutal stick and he’s reacted. It was a mad moment. To do it to your own fan, though, it’s a line I just can’t imagine [you would cross]. It shocked me.

“That will be it. He will have no chance of playing for Marseille again.”"

RIP iPhone 9.

The shiny new hardware includes a front-facing sensor module housed in the now infamous ‘notch’ which takes an unsightly but necessary bite out of the top of an otherwise (near) edge-to-edge display and thereby enables the smartphone to sense and map depth — including facial features.

So the iPhone X knows it’s your face looking at it and can act accordingly, e.g. by displaying the full content of notifications on the lock screen vs just a generic notice if someone else is looking. So hello contextual computing. And also hey there additional barriers to sharing a device.

Face ID has already generated a lot of excitement but the switch to a facial biometric does raise privacy concerns — given that the human face is naturally an expression-rich medium which, inevitably, communicates a lot of information about its owner without them necessarily realizing it.

You can’t argue that a face tells rather more stories over time than a mere digit can. So it pays to take a closer look at what Apple is (and isn’t doing here) as the iPhone X starts arriving in its first buyers’ hands…

Face ID

The core use for the iPhone X’s front-facing sensor module — aka the TrueDepth camera system, as Apple calls it — is to power a new authentication mechanism based on a facial biometric. Apple’s brand name for this is Face ID.

To use Face ID iPhone X owners register their facial biometric by tilting their face in front of the TrueDepth camera.

The face biometric system replaces the Touch ID fingerprint biometric which is still in use on other iPhones (including on the new iPhone 8/8 Plus).

Only one face can be enrolled for Face ID per iPhone X — vs multiple fingerprints being allowed for Touch ID. Hence sharing a device being less easy, though you can still share your passcode.

As we’ve covered off in detail before Apple does not have access to the depth-mapped facial blueprints that users enroll when they register for Face ID. A mathematical model of the iPhone X user’s face is encrypted and stored locally on the device in a Secure Enclave.

Face ID also learns over time and some additional mathematical representations of the user’s face may also be created and stored in the Secure Enclave during day to day use — i.e. after a successful unlock — if the system deems them useful to “augment future matching”, as Apple’s white paper on Face ID puts it. This is so Face ID can adapt if you put on glasses, grow a beard, change your hair style, and so on.

The key point here is that Face ID data never leaves the user’s phone (or indeed the Secure Enclave). And any iOS app developers wanting to incorporate Face ID authentication into their apps do not gain access to it either. Rather authentication happens via a dedicated authentication API that only returns a positive or negative response after comparing the input signal with the Face ID data stored in the Secure Enclave.

Senator Al Franken wrote to Apple asking for reassurance on exactly these sorts of question. Apple’s response letter also confirmed that it does not generally retain face images during day-to-day unlocking of the device — beyond the sporadic Face ID augmentations noted above.

“Face images captured during normal unlock operations aren’t saved, but are instead immediately discarded once the mathematical representation is calculated for comparison to the enrolled Face ID data,” Apple told Franken.

Apple’s white paper further fleshes out how Face ID functions — noting, for example, that the TrueDepth camera’s dot projector module “projects and reads over 30,000 infrared dots to form a depth map of an attentive face” when someone tries to unlock the iPhone X (the system tracks gaze as well which means the user has to be actively looking at the face of the phone to activate Face ID), as well as grabbing a 2D infrared image (via the module’s infrared camera). This also allows Face ID to function in the dark.

“This data is used to create a sequence of 2D images and depth maps, which are digitally signed and sent to the Secure Enclave,” the white paper continues. “To counter both digital and physical spoofs, the TrueDepth camera randomizes the sequence of 2D images and depth map captures, and projects a device-specific random pattern. A portion of the A11 Bionic processor’s neural engine — protected within the Secure Enclave — transforms this data into a mathematical representation and compares that representation to the enrolled facial data. This enrolled facial data is itself a mathematical representation of your face captured across a variety of poses.”

So as long as you have confidence in the calibre of Apple’s security and engineering, Face ID’s architecture should given you confidence that the core encrypted facial blueprint to unlock your device and authenticate your identity in all sorts of apps is never being shared anywhere.

But Face ID is really just the tip of the tech being enabled by the iPhone X’s TrueDepth camera module.

Face-tracking via ARKit

Apple is also intending the depth sensing module to enable flashy and infectious consumer experiences for iPhone X users by enabling developers to track their facial expressions, and especially for face-tracking augmented reality. AR generally being a huge new area of focus for Apple — which revealed its ARKit support framework for developers to build augmented reality apps at its WWDC event this summer.

And while ARKit is not limited to the iPhone X, ARKit for face-tracking via the front-facing camera is. So that’s a big new capability incoming to Apple’s new flagship smartphone.

“ARKit and iPhone X enable a revolutionary capability for robust face tracking in AR apps. See how your app can detect the position, topology, and expression of the user’s face, all with high accuracy and in real time,” writes Apple on its developer website, going on to flag up some potential uses for the API — such as for applying “live selfie effects” or having users’ facial expressions “drive a 3D character”.

The consumer showcase of what’s possible here is of course Apple’s new animoji. Aka the animated emoji characters which were demoed on stage when Apple announced the iPhone X and which enable users to virtually wear an emoji character as if was a mask, and then record themselves saying (and facially expressing) something.

So an iPhone X user can automagically ‘put on’ the alien emoji. Or the pig. The fox. Or indeed the 3D poop.

But again, that’s just the beginning. With the iPhone X developers can access ARKit for face-tracking to power their own face-augmenting experiences — such as the already showcased face-masks in the Snap app.

“This new ability enables robust face detection and positional tracking in six degrees of freedom. Facial expressions are also tracked in real-time, and your apps provided with a fitted triangle mesh and weighted parameters representing over 50 specific muscle movements of the detected face,” writes Apple.

The #iPhoneX face mapping is so much crazier than just unlocking your phone App: @MeasureKit pic.twitter.com/xYUlTQAD5X — Tyler Stalman (@stalman) November 4, 2017

Now it’s worth emphasizing that developers using this API are not getting access to every datapoint the TrueDepth camera system can capture. This is also not literally recreating the Face ID model that’s locked up in the Secure Enclave — and which Apple touts as being accurate enough to have a failure rate as small as one in one million times.

But developers are clearly being given access to some pretty detailed face maps. Enough for them to build powerful user experiences — such as Snap’s fancy face masks that really do seem to be stuck to people’s skin like facepaint…

And enough, potentially, for them to read some of what a person’s facial expressions are saying — about how they feel, what they like or don’t like.

(Another API on the iPhone X provides for AV capture via the TrueDepth camera — which Apple says “returns a capture device representing the full capabilities of the TrueDepth camera”, suggesting the API returns photo + video + depth data (though not, presumably, at the full resolution that Apple is using for Face ID) — likely aimed at supporting additional visual special effects, such as background blur for a photo app.)

Now here we get to the fine line around what Apple is doing. Yes it’s protecting the mathematical models of your face it uses the iPhone X’s depth-sensing hardware to generate and which — via Face ID — become the key to unlocking your smartphone and authenticating your identity.

But it is also normalizing and encouraging the use of face mapping and facial tracking for all sorts of other purposes.

Entertaining ones, sure, like animoji and selfie lenses. And even neat stuff like helping people virtually try on accessories (see: Warby Parker for a first mover there). Or accessibility-geared interfaces powered by facial gestures. (One iOS developer we spoke to, James Thomson — maker of calculator app PCalc — said he’s curious “whether you could use the face tracking as an accessibility tool, for people who might not have good (or no) motor control, as an alternative control method”, for example.)

Yet it doesn’t take much imagination to think what else certain companies and developers might really want to use real-time tracking of facial expressions for: Hyper sensitive expression-targeted advertising and thus even more granular user profiling for ads/marketing purposes. Which would of course be another tech-enabled blow to privacy.

It’s clear that Apple is well aware of the potential risks here. Clauses in its App Store Review Guidelines specify that developers must have “secure user consent” for collecting “depth of facial mapping information”, and also expressly prohibit developers from using data gathered via the TrueDepth camera system for advertising or marketing purposes.

In clause 5.1.2 (iii) of the developer guidelines, Apple writes:

Data gathered from the HomeKit API or from depth and/or facial mapping tools (e.g. ARKit, Camera APIs, or Photo APIs) may not be used for advertising or other use-based data mining, including by third parties.

It also forbids developers from using the iPhone X’s depth sensing module to try to create user profiles for the purpose of identifying and tracking anonymous users of the phone — writing in 5.1.2 (i):

You may not attempt, facilitate, or encourage others to identify anonymous users or reconstruct user profiles based on data collected from depth and/or facial mapping tools (e.g. ARKit, Camera APIs, or Photo APIs), or data that you say has been collected in an “anonymized,” “aggregated,” or otherwise non-identifiable way.

While another clause (2.5.13) in the policy requires developers not to use the TrueDepth camera system’s facial mapping capabilities for account authentication purposes.

Rather developers are required to stick to using the dedicated API Apple provides for interfacing with Face ID (and/or other iOS authentication mechanisms). So basically, devs can’t use the iPhone X’s sensor hardware to try and build their own version of ‘Face ID’ and deploy it on the iPhone X (as you’d expect).

They’re also barred from letting kids younger than 13 authenticate using facial recognition.

Apps using facial recognition for account authentication must use LocalAuthentication (and not ARKit or other facial recognition technology), and must use an alternate authentication method for users under 13 years old.

The sensitivity of facial data hardly needs to be stated. So Apple is clearly aiming to set parameters that narrow (if not entirely defuse) concerns about potential misuse of the depth and face tracking tools that its flagship hardware now provides. Both by controlling access to the key sensor hardware (via APIs), and by policies that its developers must abide by or risk being shut out of its App Store and barred from being able to monetize their apps.

“Protecting user privacy is paramount in the Apple ecosystem, and you should use care when handling personal data to ensure you’ve complied with applicable laws and the terms of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, not to mention customer expectations,” Apple writes in its developer guidelines.

The wider question is how well the tech giant will be able to police each and every iOS app developer to ensure they and their apps stick to its rules. (We asked Apple for an interview on this topic but at the time of writing it had not provided a spokesperson.)

Depth data being provided by Apple to iOS developers — which was only previously available to these devs in even lower resolution on the iPhone 7 Plus, thanks to that device’s dual cameras — arguably makes facial tracking applications a whole lot easier to build now, thanks to the additional sensor hardware in the iPhone X.

Though developers aren’t yet being widely incentivized by Apple on this front — as the depth sensing capabilities remain limited to a minority of iPhone models for now.

Although it’s also true that any iOS app granted access to iPhone camera hardware in the past could potentially have been using a video feed from the front-facing camera, say, to try to algorithmically track facial expressions (i.e by inferring depth).

So privacy risks around face data and iPhones aren’t entirely new, just maybe a little better defined thanks to the fancier hardware on tap via the iPhone X.

Questions over consent

On the consent front, it’s worth noting that users do also have to actively give a particular app access to the camera in order for it to be able to access iOS’ face mapping and/or depth data APIs.

“Your app description should let people know what types of access (e.g. location, contacts, calendar, etc.) are requested by your app, and what aspects of the app won’t work if the user doesn’t grant permission,” Apple instructs developers.

Apps also can’t pull data from the APIs in the background. So even after a user has consented for an app to access the camera, they have to be actively using the app for it to be able to pull facial mapping and/or depth data. So it should not be possible for apps to continuously facially track users — unless a user continues to use their app.

Although it’s also fair to say that users failing to read and/or properly understand T&Cs for digital services remains a perennial problem. (And Apple has sometimes granted additional permissions to certain apps — such as when it temporarily gave Uber the ability to record the iPhone user’s screen even when the app was in the background. But that is an exception, not the rule.)

Add to that, certain popular apps that make use of the camera as part of their core proposition — say, the likes of social sharing apps like Facebook, Snap, Instagram etc — are likely going to able to require the user gives access to the TrueDepth API if they want to use the app at all.

So the ‘choice’ for a user may be between being facially tracked by their favorite app or foregoing using the app entirely…

Yeap. You can require the True Depth camera for your app to work. https://t.co/kH7lCvGSo4 — Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) November 2, 2017

One iOS developer we spoke to played down any expansion of privacy concerns related to the additional sensor hardware in the TrueDepth module, arguing: “To a certain extent, you could do things already with the 2D front facing camera if the user gives access to it — the added depth data doesn’t really change things.”

Another suggested the resolution of the depth data that Apple supplies via the new API is still “relatively low” — while also being “slightly higher res data” than the iPhone 7 Plus depth data. Though this developer had yet to test out the TrueDepth API to prove out their supposition.

“I’ve worked with the iOS 11 depth data APIs (the ones introduced at WWDC; before TrueDepth) a bit, and the data they supply at least with the iPhone 7 Plus is pretty low res (<1MP),” they told us.

Most of the iOS devs we contacted were still waiting to get their hands on an iPhone X to be able to start playing around with the API and seeing what’s possible.

Ultimately, though, it will be up to individual iPhone X users to decide whether they trust a particular company/app developer to give it access to the camera and thus also access to the facial tracking and facial mapping toolkit that Apple is placing in developers’ hands with the iPhone X.

The issue of user consent is a potentially thorny one, though, especially given incoming tighter regulations in the European Union around how companies handle and process personal data.

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) comes into force across the 28 Member States of the EU in May next year, and sets new responsibilities and liabilities for companies processing EU citizens’ personal data — including by expanding the definition of what personal data is.

And since US tech giants have many EU users, the new rules in Europe are effectively poised to drive up privacy standards for major apps — thanks to the risk of far steeper fines for companies found violating the bloc’s rules.

Liabilities under GDPR can also extend to any third party entities a company engages to process personal data on its behalf — though it’s not entirely clear, in the case of Apple, whether it will be at risk of being in any way liable for how iOS developers process their app users’ personal data given its own business relationship with those developers. Or whether all the risk and responsibility pertaining to a particular app will lie with its developer (and any of their own sub-processors).

The EU regulation is undoubtedly already informing how Apple shapes its own contractual arrangements with app developers — such as stating developers must get appropriate consents from users so that it can demonstrate it’s taken appropriate contractual steps to safeguard user data. And also by setting limits on what developers can do with the data, as the clauses detailed above show.

Although, again, Apple is also creating risk by making it easier for developers to map and track users’ faces at scale. “Every time you introduce a new player into the ecosystem by definition you create vulnerability,” agrees Scott Vernick a partner and privacy and cybersecurity expert at law firm Fox Rothschild. “Because it’s a question of… how can you police all of those app developers?”

One thing is clear: The level of consent that app developers will need to obtain to process EU users’ personal data — and facial data is absolutely personal data — is going to step up sharply next year.

So the sort of generic wording that Snap, for example, is currently showing to iPhone X users when it asks them for camera permissions (see screengrabs below) is unlikely to meet Europe’s incoming standard on consent next year — since it’s not even specifying what it’s using the camera access for. Nor saying whether it’s engaging in facial tracking. A vague ref to “and more” probably won’t suffice in future…

GDPR also gives EU citizens the right to ask what personal data a company holds on them and the right to request their personal data be deleted — which requires companies to have processes in place to A) know exactly what personal data they are holding on each user and B) have systems in place capable of deleting specific user data on demand.

Vernick believes GDPR will likely have a big impact when it comes to a feature like iPhone X-enabled facial tracking — saying developers making use of Apple’s tools will need to be sure they have “proper disclosures” and “proper consent” from users or they could risk being in breach of the incoming law.

“That issue of the disclosure and the consent just becomes incredibly magnified on the EU side in view of the fact that GDPR comes into place in May 2018,” he says. “I think you will see a fair amount of interest on the EU side about exactly what information third parties are getting. Because they’ll want to make sure the appropriate consents are in place — but also that the appropriate technical issues around deletion of the data, and so forth.”

What does an appropriate consent look like under GDPR when facial mapping and tracking comes into play? Could an app just say it wants to use the camera — as Snap is — without specifying it might be tracking your expressions, for example?

The consent will have to be open and notorious in order for it to satisfy the GDPR.

“If you just look at it from the perspective of GDPR I think that there will have to be a very notorious and outright disclosure,” responds Vernick. “I haven’t quite thought through whether the consent comes from Facebook or whether it comes from the application developer itself or the application but in any event, regardless of who’s responsible for the consent, as we would say here in the States the consent will have to be open and notorious in order for it to satisfy the GDPR.”

“Start with the premise that the GDPR is designed to, as a default, establish that the data is the consumer’s data. It’s not the technology company’s data or the app developer’s data,” he continues. “The premise of GDPR is that every country controlling or processing data of EU citizens will have to get specific consents with respect to every use that’s intended by the application, product or service. And you will have to give EU citizens also the right to delete that information. Or otherwise reclaim it and move it. So those general rules will apply here with equal force but even more so.”

Asked whether he thinks the GDPR will effectively raise privacy standards for US users of digital services as well as for EU users, Vernick says: “It will depend on the company, obviously, and how much of their business is tied to the EU vs how much of it is really just based in the US but I actually think that as a regulatory matter you will see much of this converge.”

“There will be less of a regulatory divide or less of a regulatory separateness between the EU and the States,” he adds. “I don’t think it will happen immediately but it would not surprise me at all if the kinds of things that are very much present and top of mind for EU regulations, and the GDPR, if you don’t see those morph their way over to the States… [Maybe] it just becomes technically more efficient to just have one standard so you don’t have to keep track of two schemes.

“I think that the regulatory climate will hew if you will towards standards being set by the EU.”

In the GDPR context, Apple’s own decision to encrypt and only locally store users’ sensitive facial biometric data makes perfect sense — helping it minimize its own risk and liabilities.

“If you start with the premise that it’s encrypted and stored locally, that’s great. If the app developers move away from that premise, even in a partial manner, even if they don’t have the entire [facial] mapping and all of the co-ordinates, again that produces a risk if in fact there’s unlawful access to it. In terms of the same risk of getting hold of any other personally identifiable information,” says Vernick.

“Every time you collect data you expose yourself to law enforcement, in that law enforcement generally wants a piece of it at some point,” he adds. “Now Apple seems to have head that off by saying it can’t give over what it doesn’t have because the information is not stored at Apple, it’s stored on the device… But if there’s any erosion to that principle by whatever means, or by the app developers, you sort of become targets for that kind of thing — and that will raise a whole host of questions about what exactly is law enforcement looking for and why is it looking for it, and so forth and so on.

“At a minimum those are some of the legal challenges that facial recognition poses.”"

All of the posts make credible arguments, but ignore how consolidation could be good, even great, for startups.

If we define startup success as building cornerstone companies that will go down in history and be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, we may, in fact, be entering a lean period. If we define success as building an ever wider assortment of products, shipping them to tens of millions of users and earning hundreds of millions, or even billions of dollars in short time frames, the good times may just be getting started.

Just look at the case of tbh — Ben Thompson suggests that Facebook likely paid ~$80 million for the seed-funded, one-year-old company. Each founder probably made close to $15 million for a year of work, making them better paid than All-Star NBA Champion Stephen Curry. Entrepreneurs may have to settle for acquiring mere generational wealth, rather than becoming “pledge to cure all diseases” wealthy, but the death of startups has been greatly exaggerated.

How consolidation could be great for startups

The kind of industry consolidation we see with the “Frightful Five” isn’t new to tech, it’s the norm in most industries and can actually spur innovation. The pharmaceutical and packaged food industries are heavily consolidated, have thriving startup scenes, are hyperactive in M&A and provide a glimpse of how the future of tech may unfold.

Pharma

The pharma industry was one of the earliest tech businesses and is one where first-mover advantage is real. As many leading pharma companies were founded before 1780 as after 1980, and eight of the 10 biggest companies are more than 100 years old. This sounds like the makings of a moribund market, but, in fact, between 2014-2015 there were more than 100 biotech IPOs that generated $10 billion in proceeds. A hundred years after the “winners” were established in pharma, startups are still producing money-making miracle drugs and minting multi-millionaire startup founders with startling regularity.

Company Year Founded Market Cap Johnson & Johnson 1886 $382B Novartis 1758 (1) $215B Pfizer 1849 $215B Roche 1896 $201B Merck 1891 $170B AbbVie 1888 (2) $146B Amgen 1980 $130B Sanofi 1718 (3) $121B Bristol-Myers Squibb 1887 $105B Gilead Sciences 1987 $104B

1) Originally founded as Geigy. 2) Originally founded as Abbott Laboratories. 3) Originally founded as Laboratoires Midy. Market Cap data via Google Finance.

How did this happen? The established companies have scaled their organizations to handle the drudge work of getting a drug through clinical trials, past FDA review (and its global counterparts) and, once cleared, into the hands of doctors and patients. This organizational structure and scale make them ill-suited to pursue novel R&D, which is where the startups shine. Startups can now orient themselves entirely toward finding breakthrough cures and not worry about commercialization. If a startup develops a novel cancer drug, or even a molecule that looks promising, Sanofi, Novartis or one of their peers will buy it.

Food

Critics of the pharma comparison will point out that intellectual property is critical in the biotech/life sciences industries and software-based tech startups don’t have the same negotiating leverage. This is a fair point. However, the pattern of large companies focused on marketing and distribution acquiring nimble innovators also plays out in the packaged food business, which, like software, has little in the way of IP, relies on commodities as inputs and thrives by surfing changing consumer tastes. Look at the top 10 packaged food companies by revenue and the years in which they were founded:

A few of us over here at TechCrunch received our new toys today and wanted to share some initial thoughts with y’all.

Leggo.

First up, Megan Rose Dickey, the lunatic who at one point told co-workers she felt like she was on drugs during her initial iPhone X exploration:

I could barely sleep last night because I knew that at some point today, my iPhone X would arrive. After getting showered and dressed, I went on over to my parents’ place, where I was set to receive the shipment. FedEx arrived around 11am PT this morning and I promptly lost my shit. The first thing I did, obviously, was try out the animoji. Here’s one I sent to my colleague Darrell Etherington.

The animoji are great, but now I want anibitmoji, ya know? Anyway, the Face ID works like magic and I love it.

Next up, Sarah Buhr, who did not feel she was on drugs but was definitely grinning from ear-to-ear when the UPS guy arrived today:

My previous phone was an iPhone 6 with a hairline crack on the screen I never bothered to fix so the X was a much needed upgrade. It’s also a beautiful piece of machinery. I’m still setting it up this afternoon but so far Face ID seems to work very well. It even recognizes me with glasses on or off. The camera lives up to the hype, too. Hi-res, high-quality. I took a pic of my living room against the window and the light and color still balanced well. Nice touch!

One thing I would like to skip is the need to swipe up after the phone IDs your face. The swiping takes some getting used to and there’s a lot of swiping with this phone. Why not just ID my face and let me in?

And Darrell Etherington, who reserved the phone for pick-up in-store first thing Friday morning so he could check out the launch-day hype in person:

This iPhone replaces the iPhone 8 Plus I had been using (which is now on its way to a new home with my dad). It’s already a huge step-up from the Plus line for me just because of the size, since it’s a lot smaller without sacrificing much screen real estate. I, too, love the Animoji – I’ve been using them like you’d use voice messages on WhatsApp or WeChat, since they’re incredibly easy to record and I feel like if I’m asking about dinner plans it’s just better coming from a pig or a panda.

I’m also surprised at how quickly I adapted to Face ID, which I never thought would even approach Touch ID in terms of convenience. I now already find myself assuming it’s going to work on the 8 Plus and my iPad Pro, and taking a minute to remember to use my thumb or finger instead.

Fitz Tepper depended on the hospitality of his hotel and a backup order to make absolutely sure he was ready and armed with iPhone X on day one of availability:

I’m pretty weird about needing to get Apple devices the morning they come out. Old-timers will remember my first-ever post on TC was when I camped out at the only store in the U.S. to have the Apple Watch on launch day. SO, when I found out I’d be in Chicago for a conference on the big day, I had to prepare accordingly. I stayed up until 3am on preorder day and somehow managed to get one sent to my hotel, and another one to my house. The idea was that my flight back home was at 4pm, and there was no way I’d be thwarted by a late UPS delivery. Worst case I’d just have the hotel ship me the second one to return or give to a family member. Anyways, I’m just now getting it up and running — and my only initial thoughts are regarding the size and screen. It’s so small! Coming from many years of using iPhone pluses, it’s weird typing on a smaller keyboard. Of course the trade-off is that the device itself feels great, and fits perfectly in your hand. One other weird thing that’s going to take getting used to — no home button. I have 10 years of home button muscle memory, and that’s definitely not going to be fixed overnight.

We’re by no means trying to sell you on the iPhone X. It’s super expensive and a lot of us will be paying it off for quite some time. But if you like the latest and greatest technology, this is it. Check out TC’s official iPhone X review here."

The “Burning Man meets Davos” event company has bought a mountain, rented cruise ships and, this week, is taking over Los Angeles.

If you can get an invite, Summit could see you learn to free dive or meditate, watch Quentin Tarantino or Kendrick Lamar debate art, take a class on polyamory or protest organization, rock out to Thievery Corporation, hear Google’s Eric Schmidt talk business or Erin Brockovich talk social justice, eat a gourmet meal and then dance until sunrise.

Summit was designed not around a traditional conference theme, but to stoke camaraderie around curiosity. “We’re in the age of the polymath,” says Summit co-founder Jeff Rosenthal. “People are into everything. They’re wakeboarders who are also engineers who enjoy painting in their free time.” His co-founder, Elliot Bisnow, calls it a community for “Multi-disciplinary thought leaders with the intention of shaping the world.”

Now it’s trying to turn that intention into concrete impact so Summit isn’t just a party for the privileged.

Experiencing Summit is an exercise in cognitive dissonance. You’re gathering with an exclusive, elite community while riffing on ideas to help the impoverished. You discuss gender inequality as guys ogle women at the hot tub, with the company accused of porting in Instagram models in the past. And you’re flying to a remote destination like Tulum, Mexico or living it up on a gas-guzzling cruise liner while championing the environment.

But over the years Summit has increasingly striven to give attendees ways to give back or at least offset their guilt.

That’s part of the reason this week’s event is happening in the center of LA, which is much more accessible than a cruise through the Bahamas or a Utah ski mansion. It’s why Summit has finally focused on hitting an even gender ratio, improving ethnic diversity (it’s got a ways to go) and offering scholarships for artists and activists who can’t afford tickets that typically start at several thousands of dollars. And it’s what gave birth to the company’s nonprofit arm, Summit Institute.

Summit has helped raise $2.5 million to protect one million acres of land in Sarara Kenya, and partnered with The Nature Conservancy to create a 77-square-mile reserve off the Bahamas where its cruises tour. It’s also raised $50,000 for the Fish Face program that uses facial recognition software to determine which species are being overfished.

It’s easy to write-off Summit as merely a playground for the prosperous that’s looking to improve its image. But my interviews with the team gave me the impression that it’s earnest in its drive to utilize this wealth and passion, pushing Summitters to put their money where their woke mouths are. There’s even a session this weekend bluntly titled “Now what? Turning conversation into action.”

From base camp to summit

“I didn’t get invited to any gatherings,” Bisnow tells me about how Summit Series got started. The 22-year-old real estate newsletter author’s answer to feeling uncool? Create his own aspirational event that people he admired would attend. So in 2008, Bisnow, Rosenthal, Brett Leve, Jeremy Schwartz and Ryan Begelman created what would become Summit Series with their first assembly in a Park City, Utah.

Just 19 people showed up.

“We come from nothing, and it was just us cold-calling people for a ski trip,” says Rosenthal. But by fostering an atmosphere for ambitious ideas about both personal and global enlightenment, momentum grew.

Bisnow and the team charged another event in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico on credit cards, and a circle of rising stars in the startup world began to coalesce. That’s when the Summit crew was invited to produce an event at the White House where they brought 35 entrepreneurs, like Twitter co-founder Evan Williams and Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh, to explore economic issues with senior Obama staff.

That set Summit on an audacious path to being more than a vacation company. “There’s this underlying hope to create community that has influence, that has access, and that has the ability to affect change,” says Shantell Martin, one of Summit’s eventual artists-in-residence. Her notebook doodle-style illustrations would later turn the chintzy Summit At Sea cruise ship elevators into immersive daydreams.

By 2010, Summit was organizing fundraisers with Bill Clinton at the Def Jam records co-founder Russell Simmons’ NYC mansion, and throwing a three-day event in Washington, D.C. While attendance had grown to 750, Summit was meticulous about curating its core clientele. Most were either personally invited, or had passed screening interviews after being referred by an existing member.

But entry doesn’t come down to money raised, companies sold or headlines grabbed. Bisnow says Summit is for, “first and foremost, really nice people. People living their passions, doing good work in the world. It doesn’t just mean running a business,” he explains. “You can be an ‘intrepreneur’ inside of any company, you can be working with the sciences or arts, excelling at teaching . . . we want to build a community of good-hearted people.”

That creates an extremely unique ambiance at Summit events where people genuinely want to meet each other. There’s a sense that everyone has some special skill or experience worth hearing about, so it’s common to strike up conversations with strangers. Yet talk usually focuses on excitement and impact rather than job titles and name-dropping.

The sense of camaraderie was most apparent in Summit’s hey-day, with its first 1,500-person Summit At Sea in 2011 where big-wigs let their guard down to dance on the deck through dawn. 2013’s Summit Outside saw 700 people glamp out in tents and all sit down for a hillside sunset dinner at a single table more than a mile long. There I huddled under the stars discussing gay rights activism through song with one of the playwrites of Avenue Q before he sang his new tune over an instrumental saved on his phone. When a stray ad exec bro mechanically asked who people worked for, they were chided for making the moment transactional.

Summit Outside was the triumphant inauguration of the organization’s new home base on Utah’s Powder Mountain that it had bought for $40 million with help from some wealthier members who are now building homes there.

No internet meant few distractions for a notoriously wired set who traded boardrooms for paintball and horseback riding in the wilderness. The band Poolside played poolside as Summitters swayed to the lazy dance rock, before night fell to the sounds of OutKast rapper Big Boi. Attendees were told they were the change-makers, responsible for delivering the empowerment vibration back to society. Cynicism was at a minimum.

“Show love to the startups and don’t fanboy the big-timers”

This Summit rule became more and more critical as the community tried to scale. The disparity between speakers and attendees widened, and some big-wigs would get mobbed between sessions while snubbing those without fame.

At 2015’s Summit At Sea, there were 4,000 guests on board, and rips in the seams began to show. Summit had become a known spectacle and status symbol, akin to a private Coachella. As friends-of-friends-of-friends were admitted, it was more about who you knew than what you’d created.

Summitters began to slip from being “like-minded” into obvious homogeneity. “We’re all white dudes. We know it,” Rosenthal says of the founding team. “It’s all referrals. There is a limitation to that.” New members mirrored the core, concentrated around Caucasians from NY, SF and LA.

One of Summit’s most popular perennial speakers, relationship guru Esther Perel, tells me, “A lot of people didn’t feel particularly safe on the boat. Not women, not people of color. You can feel very small if you’re not a big name.” The natural excess of the Vegas-style cruise liners seemed gaudy when contrasted to the organization’s intentions.

Luckily, Rosenthal says, “We find criticism is the greatest gift.” He understands that “if we do things that aren’t aligned with the culture even a little bit, then everyone is active participant in that. Any community can lose its cool.”

So Summit stepped up. It implemented more scholarships and discounts to improve socioeconomic diversity, selling higher-priced luxury accommodations to the rich in order to subsidize lower-priced options. It tried to internationalize the membership. It sought top female entrepreneurs so that now Bisnow says “all the events are 50-50 men and women or very close to that.” It improved accountability and reporting structures to weed out creeps. And it partnered with an anti-recidivism program to bring formerly incarcerated juveniles aboard the boat. Some “had never left the country. None had ever been on a cruise ship,” says Rosenthal.

The strides were evident on 2016’s Summit At Sea trip, which felt less boozy and sexually charged with leaders from a wider range of backgrounds.

Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors discussed racial inequality, and civil rights heroes like Dolores Huerta and LeDonna Harris spoke about carrying on the fight in the wake of Donald Trump’s election. Held November 9th to 11th last year, the boat became a place to commiserate Hillary Clinton’s loss and unite for the upcoming struggle.

Rather than a place to escape and forget the real world, Summit was returning to its roots of hoping to change it. There’s still long way to go, though. “The problem is that the people who attend these diversity talks are the diverse people,” Martin notes.

One solution has been for Summit to launch a calendar of cheaper, smaller, more intimate events on Powder Mountain throughout the summers and winters. With fewer friends and programming options, attendees are better exposed to new people and the ideas Summit prioritizes. After hitting the slopes atop the hill or practicing archery and yoga at the bottom, attendees bond on the chairlift or by the fireside instead of raving to all-night DJ sets.

“I liked how ‘Kumbaya’ it was from the beginning. Most conferences give you the schedule, and say ‘here’s your networking break,’ “, sustainable fashion company Zady’s co-founder and Trailmix VC partner Soraya Dorabi tells me about her Summit experiences. “I’m a New Yorker and we don’t hug each other. But by the end of the weekend I was hugging strangers because I truly was inspired.”

From summit to society

Now the goal is spreading that sense of inspiration beyond the Summit goers and getaways. That includes using Summit’s homegrown social networking app to tie the community together after the events end.

While unticketed civilians can’t attend this weekend’s programming in LA, which the founders previously implied was part of the plan, hosting Summit in a big city for the first time in nearly a decade could make members feel more responsible to the world at large.

“If it can be a conduit for galvanizing people to think broadly about philanthropy, then there’s an opportunity if not a duty for them to do some altruism,” says Dorabi. “What I’d love to see come out of Summit is measurable impact.” That could mean organizing post-event volunteering, more strongly soliciting donations and teaching members how to communicate the event’s philosophies to friends.

The weekend’s headlining talk will see Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos speak about charity with his brother Mark Bezos, who leads the education-focused Bezos Family Foundation. That’s a stern shift from Summit At Sea 2015’s big panel with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick laughing it up about the potential of self-driving cars… that we all know stand to replace millions of jobs.

“There’s definitely a larger purpose. I‘m not sure if they’ve reached it yet,” says Martin, who hopes for continued progress while commending Summit for its artist-in-residence program she thinks more companies should adopt.” Perel believes the founders have gotten the message. “They’re building an aspirational community that’s very steeped in quality of life, integrity, entertainment and high levels of self-expression,” she says.

“We want to have a really positive impact while we’re here on earth because life’s too short,” says Rosenthal. The Kool-Aid flows strong at Summit, that’s for sure. Still, a culture of in-person idealism, even if naive or with gaps, is a refreshing alternative to the exhausting trudge through Twitter snark and aimless clicktivism.

Summit is experiencing an offline parallel to Facebook’s own rocky evolution. Both have succeeded in creating community. But connecting people isn’t enough. Community can be squandered, and shallow interaction can drain energy from making real impact. It can’t be enough to feel good without doing good. The foundation is there, though.

Summit’s toughest climb will be ensuring awareness and sincerity are harnessed for action. Bisnow calls it “a learning festival, the ultimate post-college education.” But after nine years, Summit seems ready to graduate. “What’s the reason that Summit should exist? To date it’s all been about connecting people and having a great experience,” Bisnow concludes. “Okay. Now, on a really big scale, how do we activate our community about the issues of our time?’"

It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.

The iPhone X is the huge leap forward that Apple's handsets needed. Aside from the original iPhone in 2007, this new iPhone is set to have the biggest impact on Apple’s smartphone direction ever.

Apple itself is calling it the future of the smartphone, the embodiment of what it’s been trying to achieve for a decade. But while the iPhone X is all about premium parts and an all-new experience, it’s a huge gamble for the Cupertino brand too as it tries to reclaim some leadership in smartphone innovation.

Losing key, reliable elements like the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, the home button; introducing new methods of navigating and unlocking the phone – and charging a lot more for the privilege – seems risky for a company that was already treading new ground by doing away with the traditional headphone jack last year.

But the iPhone X is the handset we’ve been demanding from Apple for years – a world away from the increasingly-tired designs that those who just want a new iPhone have had to make do with.

The fervor around this phone tells that story – everyone wants to know if the new iPhone X is worth having, partly because it actually represents a new iPhone, and that fervor is such that they don’t seem to care about the cost.

So… is the iPhone X worth having? Will it change the direction of an industry where many of the specs Apple has put in – wireless charging, bezel-less displays and face recognition – are already on the market?

Can Apple put all this together in the way that just works, and create the greatest iPhone of all time?

Released on November 3

The most expensive flagship phone on the market

Comes in 64GB and 256GB options

It’s almost pointless to discuss the price of the iPhone X – it’s the most expensive flagship phone on the market, but iPhone users are more willing than most to look past cost.

But, while the focus here is going to be on the technology, we still need to at least mention the price and release date.

The iPhone X costs $999 / £999 / AU$1,579 for the basic, 64GB model. If you want the larger 256GB model it’s going to cost you $1,149 / £1,149 / AU$1,829 for the privilege.

If you want to buy the iPhone X you can already pre-order it – the window for doing so opened on October 27. We mention that because while the iPhone X release date was November 3, you probably won’t be able to get one for weeks or months now… that ship has sailed.

Screen

By far the best screen on an iPhone

Clear, vibrant colors

Notch at top slightly irks, but doesn’t get in the way

The first thing you’ll notice about the new iPhone is hard to miss: the new screen blazes into your eyes the second you pick up the handset.

The 5.8-inch OLED display is, quite simply, by far the best thing Apple has ever crammed into an iPhone. It’s leaps ahead of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus for so many reasons: the sharpness, the quality, the fact that it fills the whole front of the phone, and the color reproduction.

It’s also using a new, longer, screen, but while it looks larger than the iPhone 8 Plus’ 5.5-inch display on paper, it’s only marginally bigger in terms of actual screen real estate – it’s just stretched upwards.

The stretched screen is a completely different experience on the iPhone X

OLED technology means you’re getting deeper blacks and more blinding whites, so everything from websites to the photos you take will look a little better.

Some will point to the fact that Samsung has been using OLED screens on its phones since the first Galaxy, but Apple counters that by saying it’s only now that the technology is good enough for its phones.

On the face of it that sounds defensive, but when you use the iPhone X you can see it’s a screen that’s incredibly, well, Apple. It’s not the sharpest or most colorful screen on a smartphone, but it’s clean, crisp and doesn’t suffer from terrible color shifts when you move it around. It’s a great screen to look at, and that’s what you want on a phone.

The term ‘bezel-less’ has been bandied about for the iPhone X, but that doesn’t really tell the right story. Yes, there are slight bands around the edges of the screen, but they don’t mar the experience – they give the fingers something to land on, preventing accidental touches of the screen.

Apple could reduce these further in the future and offer a more visually-appealing iPhone, but on the X the experience is still striking.

Talking of visual appeal, the notch at the top of the iPhone X is something that’s going to divide opinion, and that’s fair. Apple has taken this little chunk out of the top of the screen to house the new TrueDepth camera, and it encroaches on the display.

In portrait mode it’s hard to notice it’s there, and the way the notifications bar spills around it is nice. However, place the phone in landscape mode and it’s far more noticeable; it’s an irritant when you’re watching movies, as if we wanted to expand them to fill the screen (one of the real beauties of having a longer display) elements of the action were cut out by the notch.

While we’re talking about that longer screen, the 18:9 format is something we’ve seen on a number of other phones this year, and in the Android world the apps are largely encoded to fill the display just fine.

On the iPhone X, however, that’s not the case, with 99% of the apps we used packing massive black bars above and below the display, and those that were taking advantage of the aspect ratio displaying some glitches – Twitter, for instance, blocks out elements of your tweets.

Native apps have a space below the keyboard where the home button would have gone

The issue with apps using the black bars is that it makes the iPhone X look like any other handset from Apple – the screen is the main visual differentiator on this phone, and you want every app to fill the display nicely.



Yes, the iPhone X is only just out on the market, and developers will likely quickly code for the new device, but right now it’s just a bit disappointing to look at – it looks more like an iPhone 3GS than a 2017 model.

The new display on the iPhone X also showcases a new feature for Apple: HDR playback. The phone can show movies encoded in the HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats, and combined with the OLED display the images offer so much more depth and realistic color reproduction.

If you’re watching a scene with explosions in it, the effect is incredible on the iPhone X – much like with all OLED screens.

However, it’s inherently harder to make out detail in darker scenes in HDR movies – that’s something you’ll need to adjust to. Compared to the LCD screen of the iPhone 8 Plus, there are times when you can see less of the action, but compare them side by side and you’ll see that the overall richness, depth and quality for watching movies is just higher on the iPhone X.

Like the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, the X uses a True Tone display, which mimics the lighting conditions around it and will adjust the white balance accordingly. It’s not a reason to buy the phone on its own, but it’s a really premium little extra that you’ll grow to like."
Cameron Faulkner,"It's a beta update, but 'beta' than nothing",2017-11-02T19:28:17.305Z,techradar,Android Oreo on your Samsung Galaxy S8? Here’s how to get it today,http://www.techradar.com/how-to/samsung-galaxy-s8-android-oreo-update-how-to-get-it-on-your-phone-today,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJUXamA7vhQyVhMNagXdYH-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"For everything the Samsung Galaxy S8 offers, it still lacks Google’s latest operating system, Android Oreo. But that’s changing today, if only by a little.

Samsung is extending the beta of Samsung Experience 9.0 to owners of the S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus in the US, UK and South Korea. Yep, the beta. While a growing list of companies are preparing the final release of the new, improved software, Samsung is holding off the official launch of this software until the debut of “the next flagship Galaxy device”. That could be at least another five months.

Nevertheless, any movement toward adopting the latest software is a good move from the smartphone giant. Here’s how to download the preview software right now.

Steps to getting Android Oreo on S8 and S8 Plus

Updating your Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to the Android Oreo beta requires a number of steps, some of which are contingent on you meeting Samsung’s oddly specific requirements.

You'll need a Samsung account set up Access the Galaxy beta program via the Samsung Members or Samsung+ app or from within the Galaxy Apps pre-installed on each phone. In the US, you must have purchased the phone from either Sprint or T-Mobile, or have an unlocked S8 phone loaded up with a SIM card from one of those carriers. In the UK, the rules are a little less strict. You just need an unlocked device, one that isn’t locked-down by your operator.

If you meet the standards to be a beta tester, you’ll receive the download, which will replace the Android Nougat install that your device came loaded with out of the box. That being said, make sure that all of your valued data is backed up, as Samsung claims that unexpected errors may occur during your use with the new experience.

Having trouble gaining access to the beta program? Samsung is opening the beta to users in rounds, so the rollout won’t be sudden. This is for the better, so that the company can fix any glaring issues, should they arise, before they spread to the masses."

Unfortunately, this is a very real risk that Nintendo Switch owners currently face.

Going back to the tense days of corrupted PlayStation memory cards and dying Game Boys, the Nintendo Switch doesn’t offer any way to back up game saves. That means that if your Switch console is lost, stolen or breaks all of that progress you made in Super Mario Odyssey will just disappear. Like the entire adventure never happened.

Compared to PlayStation and Xbox’s cloud storage and physical back up capabilities, this leaves the Nintendo Switch looking slightly behind the times. Fortunately, according to Nintendo of America boss, Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo is actually “aware of the concern” and working on a solution.

Looking for a Switch solution

In an interview with Mashable, Fils-Aime said “You’re talking to someone who has completed 120 Shrines, and I think I’m at 400 Korok seeds and growing [in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]. So I understand what it’s like putting a lot of time into content, and the thought of that content not being there.”

He went on to say that being a consumer-oriented company and desirous of making them happy, this is an area Nintendo is “going to continue working on to make sure that we can alleviate some of those consumer fears of having a content-based issue.”

It is, apparently, the hybrid nature of the console that’s causing some complications when it comes to developing a solution and Fils-Aime lamented that “it’s not as simple as a piece of hardware that never moves and is always connected in an online environment.”

At the moment, the closest we’ve gotten to data back up on the Switch is the ability to move user profiles from console to console. Unfortunately, this doesn’t actually back up any of the save data at all.

It’s worth noting that cross-save is actually possible between the PS4 and the handheld Vita so we hope a solution will be swift. At the very least, it’s good to know that Nintendo is working on it."

Right now, the Galaxy S8 64GB international version is on sale for 25% off, for a total savings of $200.

Quick link:

For those unfamiliar, the international version of the Galaxy S8 is a little different from the model typically found in the US For one, it's a dual-SIM phone, so you can have service from two mobile carriers at the same time, or you can easily bounce back and forth between countries. That's great for travelers.

Secondly, it boasts Samsung's own Exynos 8895 octa-core chipset, which benchmarks have proven outstripping the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 found in the US version.

It also comes with a free wireless charger

Both the S8 and S8 Plus are on sale

Other than that, it's pretty much the same great phone. It has Samsung's high-quality 5.8-inch QuadHD Plus Super AMOLED display that takes up the vast majority of the phone's front. It has a superb set of front and rear cameras at 8MP and 12MP, respectively. And, it packs a 3,000mAh battery that can keep it running all day.

Now with Newegg's deal, the international model of Galaxy S8 is only $599 – a pretty great price for the best version of one of the best phones. But, Newegg sprinkles a little more magic into the deal with a free wireless charger for the phone, encouraging customers to take advantage of one of the Galaxy S8's handy, but easily overlooked features.

Anyone who needs to go a little bigger can get a similar discount on the Galaxy S8 Plus for $699 with the same free wireless charging pad."
Nick Pino,Xbox One X is a premium 4K HDR console with a storage issue,2017-11-03T07:02:05.306Z,techradar,Xbox One X review,http://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-one-x,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xKZ2Ep8cuTsoVNL4MbU35m-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"With a gaming PC's worth of graphical horsepower housed inside a deceivingly small package, the Xbox One X does what no console has done before: Native 4K HDR gaming. However, while games look absolutely stunning, with a fantastic level of detail accentuated by the console's HDR support, their larger file sizes will mean that the 1TB hard drive fills up fast. Minor faux pas aside, the Xbox One X fulfills the promise of 4K HDR gaming and offers the most premium gaming experience on a console, bar none.

At $499 (£449 / AU$649), the Xbox One X is the powerful premium console Microsoft promised us over a year and a half ago. It delivers 4K HDR at 60 frames per second (at least on a handful of titles) and, because it’s a part of Microsoft’s Xbox Family of Consoles, it doesn’t force you to throw out the games you already own for new ‘enhanced’ editions.

Games you might have played a year ago now look absolutely stunning on Xbox One X. Free updates for Rise of the Tomb Raider, Star Wars Battlefront II and Forza Motorsport 7 will help them look their absolute best when they arrive in the coming weeks and months, while Gears of War 4, Quantum Break and Super Lucky’s Tale have already been treated to the visual upgrade.

The games we mentioned above are just a small sliver of the ones found on the Enhanced for Xbox games list - there are close to 200 more games slated for updates in 2017 and 2018 alone, not counting the vast quantity of unknown titles in the works right now.

For a look at what comes in the box check out our unboxing video below

Beyond gaming, the console is also perfect for media junkies - there’s 4K Netflix on-board alongside a 4K app for YouTube, Amazon will make its Prime Video app UHD compatible starting on November 7 and, when all else fails, there’s a 4K Blu-ray player built into the box - a feature that no other console maker has at the moment. The console also supports Dolby Atmos audio, among other audio formats, making video playback sound as good as it looks.

While you can make a strong case for the Xbox One X based on its specs alone, it’s not an open-and-shut case: The X, while powerful and sleek and wonderful, is essentially a souped up version of the $279 (£249 / AU$399) Xbox One S .

The X can play games in native 4K while the S only does upscaled 4K, sure, but Xbox One S does upscaled 4K so well that you might not even be able to notice a difference between the two. And, even if you could see a small difference between them, is it enough to warrant the $200/£200 gap in price? Honestly, no, it doesn’t.

The Xbox One Family of Consoles will play all the same games and use the same interface.

Even if you disregard the One S’s existence, the Xbox One X isn’t bullet-proof. Its 1TB hard drive might seem like enough room to store your entire library but, consider the fact that all these new Enhanced for Xbox One X titles use 4K image assets, and suddenly 1TB doesn't seem so big any more.

Gears of War 4, for example, takes up 100GB on the Xbox One X. Another flagship Xbox game, Forza Motorsport 7, will be about the same when it releases its patch. Quantum Break, the Sci-Fi shooter from the studio behind Alan Wake, comes in at an internet crippling 178GB. Together, three of the Xbox One X’s most popular games will take up around 40% of your hard drive space.

All this isn’t said to shame the Microsoft fan base for its excitement with the new console - in fact, for a certain type of gamer, the Xbox One X is still the greatest console ever made in spite of its limitations. It’s just that, for most folks, the One X imposes a premium tax on a system that’s only marginally better in most ways than the cheaper Xbox One S.

So, are you someone that needs an Xbox One X? Read on to find out.

Design

If you’ve seen an Xbox One S at some point, you should be able to picture the Xbox One X - if it weren’t for the difference in color schemes, the two consoles would be nearly identical.

If you’ve never seen a One S before, the Xbox One X is a rectangular box the size of a large Blu-ray player that’s coated with a matte space grey color. It’s a far cry from the bulky VHS player-stylings of the original Xbox One, and the design only becomes more impressive when you consider what’s under the hood.

The noticeable differences here between Microsoft's last console and its latest one (if you can even notice them) are the color change from the white sheen of the Xbox One S to the space grey of Xbox One X, and the shifting of the disc tray from the top-left side of the console’s face to sitting discreetly lower down the front.

These changes are aesthetic, however, and neither add nor take away any functionality from the system … which isn’t a bad thing considering how well-equipped the Xbox One S was.

A small shift in the location of the disc drive is the biggest design difference between the X and the S.

The aforementioned disc tray not only plays Xbox One games, but 4K Blu-rays as well. This might sound sort of mundane if you’re not totally up-to-date on what 4K Blu-rays are, but considering that Microsoft’s 4K consoles is the only ones on the market with that ability, you can understand why it’s worth pointing out.

Round the back the similarities to the One S continue. From left to right you’ve got a power connector, HDMI out, HDMI in, two USB ports, an IR out, an Optical Audio port and an Ethernet port. To the surprise of no one, the console will not see the return of the original Xbox One's Kinect port - if you haven’t heard, Kinect (Microsoft's motion-sensing camera) is officially dead .

Controller-wise the new machine is packing a new darker gamepad which, for all intents and purposes, is exactly the same mechanically as the one that currently ships with the Xbox One S. You can't fix what isn't broken, apparently.

If controllers are a bit too imprecise for your liking, Xbox One X will support keyboard and mouse controls sometime in the near future. It's not the first console to first console to do so (that award goes to the Dreamcast ), but the feature will be welcomed by gamers who prefer this more accurate and responsive control scheme.

Hardware specs

If you’re looking to see the real differences between the Xbox One X and every other console that’s come before it, all you’d need to do is open the lid.

The console comes equipped with an eight-core CPU clocked at 2.3GHz, alongside 12GB of GDDR5 RAM. It features a GPU clocked at 1172MHz leaving the console with 6 teraflops of graphical computing power. It’s a fairly extensive offering, and one that should help usher in a new era of 4K HDR gaming in the living room.

But before you jump on the PC Gamer forums to tell them how consoles have finally surpassed PCs in terms of value performance, just know that unlike a video card’s dedicated VRAM, the Xbox One X’s 12GB of RAM is split in between the system and the GPU, i.e. you wouldn't be comparing apples to apples.

On the CPU side of things, the Xbox One X is running a custom chip with eight Jaguar CPU cores clocked at 2.3GHz. That’s a 76% increase compared to the CPU inside the original Xbox One and Xbox One S, but probably only puts it in the ballpark of a current-gen Intel Core i3 processor (Remember, however, that these numbers don’t translate to PCs very well).

The X's rear ports are identical to those on the Xbox One S.

The more important comparison for the Xbox One X, and the one Microsoft would rather you focus on, is to the PS4 Pro. Sony’s system is a fairly competent competitor – its GPU has 36 compute units at 911Mhz that work in tandem with a 2.1GHz CPU and 8GB of GDDR5 memory. That memory runs into a bit of a bottleneck at the buffer, which is limited to 218GB/s, but it still puts out around 4 Tflops of performance. Point, Microsoft.

Where the One X falters is on its hard drive - a small 1TB drive that comes standard in every system. It’s also non-negotiable: the only configuration Microsoft plans on selling for the holidays is a 1TB system.

This wouldn’t be such a huge sticking point if we knew Microsoft wasn’t capable of installing larger hard drives in its systems, but the existence of the 2TB Xbox One S proves that it is indeed possible and Microsoft willingly chose not to include one here.

Game performance and library

Of course, what’s the end-goal of all this extra horsepower if not a better gaming experience? Thankfully here we’re happy to report that the Xbox One X performs exactly as advertised: Games look great across the board. Whether you’re using a 1080p TV with the Xbox One X or playing in 4K HDR, games look fantastic on the next-gen console.

But let’s break down each use case individually.

If you’re a 1080p TV owner, the Xbox One X will do something called supersampling to create better-looking images. Supersampling is a complex term but the basic idea is that the game renders itself in 4K thinking it’s connected to a 4K screen, which means objects are rendered with four times the detail. All this data can’t be displayed because, at the end it’s still being shown on a 1080p TV with a set number of pixels on its display, but the resulting image is one that is more detail-rich.

In practice that means images are going to look a bit sharper. Trees, branches and foliage in general won’t look so jagged, for example, and basic fog on an Xbox One might become thicker and more realistic while using an Xbox One X.

Once you see a game running in 1080p with supersampling it’s very obvious that it looks better than a game running in standard 1080p. But if you’re not the kind of person who takes a minute to smell the roses in games - the kind who can appreciate a fine edge on a shrub or a rich, dense fog in the morning - then Xbox One X isn’t going to impress you.

That is, unless you upgrade to a 4K HDR TV.

On a 4K HDR TV, the Xbox One X unleashes its full power. Games render at up to native 4K, offering offer four times the detail of regular 1080p. Better still, some of those games will have a wider array of color options thanks to a technology called high dynamic range or HDR. Skies look bluer, grass looks greener and colors drip from every scene. The results speak for themselves.

But visual upgrades aren’t the only type of upgrades the Xbox One X offers. The other is performance - i.e. the frames per second at which a game runs.

We’ll save you another long-winded explanation on the subject, but the basic idea here is that when scenes become really detail-rich and filled with a vast number of objects, the console becomes overwhelmed. Instead of being able to output, say, 60 frames per second, it drops down to 55 or even less. It was a big problem on the original Xbox One, but one that the Xbox One S seemed to do away with under all but the most extreme circumstances.

Xbox One X tries its best to output games at 60 frames per second, a sort of golden number for the industry that matches the native refresh rate of most TVs and mainstream monitors. And while the results are noticeably better on Xbox One X, games still don’t always hit that 60 frames per second number - there are occasional dropped frames and slow downs.

So what are you to make of all this? Well, Enhanced for Xbox games do look better on an Xbox One X console, whether you’re connected to a 1080p TV or not. Performance, also, is generally great on the new console.Games don’t run at a perfect 60 frames per second like you’ll find on mid- to high-end gaming PCs, but most of the time it’s great.

OK, Enhanced for Xbox One X games look great and play great. But what exactly makes a game Enhanced for Xbox One X? How many of these games are there?

Microsoft itself hasn't set a minimum standard for what constitutes an Enhanced for Xbox One X title but there are three broad categories that developers are using: enhanced 4K visual assets, HDR visual processing or higher frame rate. And just one of three will suffice.

To that point, it’s possible for a game to offer HDR or a 60 frames-per-second framerate, but not native 4K and vice versa. Developers can pick and choose which enhancements make sense for their games and roll with it.

To make matters all-the-more complicated, Microsoft’s Xbox Chief, Phil Spencer, has gone on record saying that new games aren’t necessarily required to support the new hardware, i.e. there’s no mandate for developers to take advantage of the Xbox One X’s capabilities.

What we can say for certain is that, right now, there are well over 100 titles that are going to be Enhanced for Xbox One X. Not all of these patches will be available when the system launches on November 7, but most will be here by the end of the year, with even more coming in 2018.

New Xbox One interface

Before we close out the review, we thought it'd be a good idea to examine the interface for the Xbox One, that ever-changing software that is somehow still so divisive now three years and two major updates after launch.

If you’ve yet to download it on your Xbox One at home, the new Xbox One interface is a sort of mash-up of the Xbox 360 blade design and the Windows 10 block-and-pin-heavy design.

Like the blade design of yore, the interface is separated by purpose: there’s Home and Store tabs, which are pretty self-explanatory, but also tabs for Community, Entertainment and Mixer, a Microsoft-owned Twitch competitor. Navigating from one tab to the next is a fast and fluid experience and, to its credit, there’s always something new to look at.

One of its most unique features is turning the idea of pins - games or apps that you are really attached to - into full rows on the Home screen. This row might call attention to DLC, note how close you are to a particular achievement or show you a highlight from Mixer. It’s a novel way to keep you thinking about a game long after you quit out and something we found ourselves appreciating every time we saw it.

What we were less appreciative of, however, was how deep Microsoft buries things like friends lists, achievements and settings, all of which were a crucial part of the UI throughout the 360 years. These sections are usually relegated to the small Xbox Help Bar that’s accessed when you press the Xbox jewel.

Ultimately, while the UI looks nice and has no problem showing us strangers playing games, it still has problems showing us what what we care about most without burying us under loads of content that simply doesn't interest us.

We liked

Coming into this final review we had some concerns. We thought Microsoft’s most premium console yet might not provide anything of value to the 1080p TV owners out there. We felt that its performance, however good, might not be able to justify its price. And we were scared that games might not get patches for long stretches of time, leaving Xbox One X owners without way of showcasing their hardware. On all accounts, we were wrong.

As it turns out, the Xbox One X is a premium console through and through.

Sure, you might need a discerning eye to spot the differences between supersampled games in 1080p and games played in 1080p on the original Xbox One, but there is a difference. With 4K HDR gaming, however, the proof is in the pudding so to speak. When hooked up to a decent 4K HDR screen, the console plays games at an astoundingly high level of detail. Throw on a 4K Blu-ray with Dolby Atmos sound, and you’ll be treated to the best cinematic experience this side of movie theater.

For gamers who can afford it, the Xbox One X is the pinnacle of console gaming.

We disliked

But while the Xbox One X has claimed the new top spot, its closest competitors - the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One S - aren’t far behind.

Despite not being able to play games in native 4K, these consoles are around half the price and look nearly as good. Their better balance between affordability and performance will make them a better pick for the vast majority of gamers out there, save for the few who see and appreciate the minor differences in premium, high-octane video quality and lower grade, but-still-awesome upscaled 4K.

Even if neither of these consoles had never existed, however, the Xbox One X wouldn’t be flawless. Its 1TB hard drive could theoretically fill up almost overnight thanks to 100GB-plus downloads for games like Gears of War 4, Forza Motorsport 7 and Quantum Break, if it weren’t for the fact that these massive games will take several hours to download. Microsoft could fix this down the road with a larger size hard drive but, as it stands right now, the world’s most premium console can only store around 10 triple-A games at a time.

Final verdict

Let’s bring this full circle. At the beginning we stated that there’s a specific kind of gamer who’d appreciate the intricacies and unabashed power of the Xbox One X. By now, we hope, you’ve come to a conclusion one way or another for yourself if you fit into that category. But if not, the simplest question you can ask yourself is: ‘Will I appreciate the extra horsepower?’

If you’re the kind of gamer who stops to look at the scenic vistas in games like Skyrim, The Witcher or Dragon Age, or a streamer who can point out a 4 frame-per-second difference while looking at two videos side by side, the Xbox One X is a worthwhile investment.

That said, if you’re a gamer who just wants a console that plays great-looking games without digging too deep into your pocket books, the Xbox One X is a bit overkill - save some money and buy yourself an Xbox One S ... preferably the one with a 2TB hard drive.

Few tech topics rile folks more than interconnects. Small wonder, given that cable prices run the gamut from bargain basement to penthouse suite, despite all doing fundamentally the same job.

Well, we're here to tell you that your choice of HDMI really does make a difference, but maybe not in ways you might first imagine...and that 8K is about to throw another spanner in the works.

HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) cables have been a hot potato for years now, thanks mainly to early price gouging from retailers. Keen to supplement revenue on hardware sales, unsuspecting buyers were often subjected to a hard sell in order to get overpriced cables into their shopping baskets.

While that particular hullabaloo has largely died away, the rollout of HDR has thrown an entirely new spotlight onto the issue of HDMI cable quality.

So what should you look for when buying? How do specifications vary and can you really tell the difference between one HDMI cable and another?

The basics

Let’s get the easy stuff out of the way: if you have a bog-standard piece of HD kit that you want to connect to an HD or Ultra HD TV, pretty much any modern (low cost) HDMI cable will do, although we have recommendations on cable design which could prove useful (stick with us). If a cable is included in the box, it’ll most likely do the job.

Conversely, if you own HDMI cables that date back to the early days when manufacturers were allowed to quote version numbers, such as v1.1 or v1.2, then we’d simply retire them. They will most likely be tortoise slow and unreliable.

Things become far more interesting with high quality AV sources. This is where you need to pay attention to branding. If you’re connecting a 4K HDR component, be it a PS4 Pro or Xbox One X, or have a UHD Blu-ray player and want to carry 2160p @60Hz with 4:4:4 colour sub-sampling (which is as good as home video gets these days, and requires 17.82Gbps), you absolutely should invest in a reputable High Speed HDMI cable. HDR and wide-colour hook-up issues over HDMI are rife, and can be difficult to troubleshoot. Often a poorly made HDMI cable is the culprit.

It's possible to spend thousands on cables

A High Speed HDMI (often referred to as HDMI 2.0, after the spec) cable should support a throughput of 18 Gbps. It’s essentially a conduit for whatever your hardware is routing out. The good news is that High Speed HDMI cables are common, and not necessarily expensive.

As an aside, an 18Gbps pipe isn’t just essential for full-fat UHD. It’s useful for Next Gen object-based audio too. The spec supports up to 32 audio channels, with sampling at 1536 kHz, twice the fidelity of HDMI 1.4 (768kHz).

In praise of cable construction

HDMI cables typically adopt the same basic construction: principally a PVC jacket, with stranded core and various levels of aluminium shielding. But you can tell a lot from the build, particularly the headshell.

Avoid elaborate, over-engineered heads. They may look serious and therefore premium, but they are always the first aspect of a cable to fail, often caused by the drag of a heavily weaved cable. One piece moulds with flexibility are infinitely preferable.

Also bear in mind that the space allocated to HDMI boards on the back of TVs and source hardware is often tight, so a slim fitting cable scores over a bulky one. When lacing up your entertainment stack, keep cables short. More often than not, a 1m lead will be fine, but never exert undue pressure to make the connection.

The real minefield when buying an HDMI lead are the scores of brands which claim to offer genuine HDMI licensed cables. The obvious advice is buy from a reputable brand, rather than a bargain online seller where you can’t be sure of the provenance. Respected accessory specialist Lindy offers a range of High Speed cables, that comply to our preferred aesthetic. It sells a 2m cable for $12/£9, and 3m for $28/£13. As a guide, these prices seem entirely reasonable. If you want to pay less, go ahead, roll the dice.

Buyers should note that the Lindy cables deliver 18Gbps up to 5m, but anything beyond that is 10.2Gbps.

If you favour a particular interconnect specialist, stick with them. The Chord Company offer the C-View, part of its all-white C-Series of AV interconnects. Available in 0.75, 1.5, 2 and 3 metre lengths, this HDMI design couples a short plug to a flexible outer sheath.

An investment certainly, but there’s an intrinsic beauty to smart, well made cables. It’s one reason while an artfully manicured gaming PC or painstakingly wired custom install rack, offering smooth travel and colour coding, gives any self-respecting geek a tingle of satisfaction.

Introducing HDMI v2.1

In case you hadn’t noticed, we’re in the midst of a tumultuous upgrade to video standards, all of which have consequences for the HDMI ecosystem. With 4K now mainstream, and 8K waiting in the wings, what do you need to know about the next evolution of the standard, HDMI 2.1?

For one thing, HDMI 2.1 represents quite a step-up. At its heart is an entirely new 48 Gbps cable able to support better than 4K video resolution and very high frame rates (HFR). Translated, that means 7680 x 4320 resolution video (four times the pixel density of 4K) at 60Hz/fps and 4K at 120Hz, with dynamic HDR (choose your flavour).

Don’t get too excited just yet though. There are no commercially available TVs which have HDMI 2.1 connectivity. They’ll probably appear on 8K screens - keep an eye on the Chinese market, and 8K offerings by Hisense and ChangHong.

Of course, when 2.1 does land, your entire home entertainment ecosystem will need to be overhauled. Oh happy days.

HDMI 2.1 isn’t just for 8K TVs. It’s also relevant to Virtual Reality. VR developers also want high resolution, high frame rate video. 8K resolution or ultra fast 120fps frame rates could help transform the VR experience into something for more immersive than what we have today.

There are other applications: Healthcare, aviation and enterprise all covet higher bandwidths.

Most likely, the first source component to embrace HDMI 2.1 will be the gaming PC. And when it comes to PCs, it’s not just the resolution potential of HDMI 2.1 that’s attractive. The new specification also includes Game Mode VRR, which effectively eliminates image lag, stutter and frame tearing. The sheer speed of 2.1 enables frames to be transmitted and displayed as soon as they’re rendered.

It’ll also be hugely disruptive when it comes to AV receivers. Without HDMI 2.1 support, your 8K home cinema is a non-starter. But that’s a worry for another day..."
The Economist,Captured soldiers cast light on the work of a shadowy group,2017-11-02T15:51:20Z,the-economist,How “Wagner” came to Syria,https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21730873-captured-soldiers-cast-light-work-shadowy-group-how-wagner-came-syria,https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20171104_EUP503.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"“I AM Roman Sergeyevich Zabolotny, born in 1979, and I have been taken prisoner,” says a Russian-speaking man in a video released last month by the jihadists of Islamic State (IS). A second soldier, his right eye swollen shut, sits silently in grey robes. Both were reportedly captured during a battle near Deir ez-Zor, a city in Syria’s east and the site of a recent offensive by Russian and Syrian government forces. Yet the Russian defence ministry denied that any of its soldiers had gone missing. Friends and relatives told Russian media that the men had gone to Syria not with the Russian army, but as part of a shadowy mercenary force known as “Wagner”.

The group has come to play a key role in Russian operations in Syria. Though Russian law officially bans private military companies (PMCs), a St Petersburg-based independent news site, Fontanka.ru, reported in late 2015 that ex-soldiers were being recruited to serve in Wagner by a former special-forces officer, Dmitry Utkin. Numbering as many as 2,500 men, the group is believed to have figured heavily in operations around Palmyra in 2016, serving as “shock troops” alongside the Syrian army, says Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian security at the Institute of International Relations in Prague. Though the Russian army has not acknowledged Wagner’s existence, Mr Utkin was photographed late last year alongside President Vladimir Putin at a Kremlin reception for military officers in honour of Day of Heroes of the Fatherland. This summer America added him to its list of officials sanctioned for involvement in the Ukraine conflict of 2014, where the group is said to have got its start.













When Russia launched its intervention in Syria in September 2015, the government spoke of a short air operation. Boots on the ground were seen as taboo, especially to a population still haunted by memories of the costly Soviet war in Afghanistan. (Nearly half the population would now like to see the Syrian operation wrapped up.) But having a nominally independent cadre of fighters to deploy as ground forces gives the Russian army plausible deniability. “They serve to solve a concrete problem: have no casualties,” says Alexander Golts, a military analyst. Officially Russia’s armed forces have in fact reported some 41 deaths in Syria, including a general killed in shelling near Deir ez-Zor in September while commanding Syria’s Fifth Corps of volunteers. However, investigative journalists and bloggers reckon scores more Wagner-linked mercenaries have died in combat. On the ground, the force functions as a “pseudo-private” military company, taking direction from the Russian army, says Alexander Khramchikhin, deputy director of the Institute for Political and Military Analysis.

The model was first tested in the war in eastern Ukraine, where a patchwork of forces operated with differing degrees of distance from the Russian government. Alongside local separatists and regular Russian army units were groups of Russian volunteers and mercenaries, among them Mr Utkin and an early iteration of the Wagner force. “The rumours are that they fought, and fought well,” says one former senior separatist commander, with a sly smile. As fighting slowed in 2015, mercenaries and volunteers returned home or sought employment elsewhere. It is no secret that many of them have since left for Syria, says another former separatist leader.

The emergence of such groups revived talk in Russia of legalising Russian PMCs to create companies in the vein of American security contractors such as Academi (formerly called Blackwater). Mr Putin expressed tentative support for that idea back in 2011, calling it “a way of implementing national interests without the direct involvement of the state”. In late 2014 Gennady Nosovko, a lawmaker with the Just Russia party, submitted a bill that would have laid the legal groundwork, only to see Russia’s powerful Security Council snuff it out. Resistance was also strong from within the military and security services, which worried about losing their monopoly of violence. Other specialists, Mr Nosovko says, worried that powerful businessmen would ultimately seek to control their own private armies, with dreadful implications.

For now, the Wagnerians still operate in a grey zone. Fontanka.ru recently reported that their role has expanded to include seizing oil wells held by IS for a newly-formed Russian company, Evro Polis. As for the two captives, their fates are probably sealed, says an MP from the home region of one of them. “There’s a 99% chance that Roman and the second prisoner are no longer among the living.”"
The Economist,An economy based on attention is easily gamed,2017-11-04T00:00:00Z,the-economist,"Once considered a boon to democracy, social media have started to look like its nemesis",https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21730870-economy-based-attention-easily-gamed-once-considered-boon-democracy-social-media,https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20171104_FBP010.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"“COME on guys, let’s be serious. If you really want to do something, don’t just ‘like’ this post. Write that you are ready, and we can try to start something.” Mustafa Nayem, a Ukrainian journalist, typed those words into his Facebook account on the morning of November 21st 2013. Within an hour his post had garnered 600 comments. That prompted Mr Nayem to write again, calling on his followers to gather later that day on the Maidan square in Kiev. Three months later Ukraine’s president, Viktor Yanukovych, was removed.

At the time, this did not seem all that remarkable. From the protests around the Iranian elections of 2009 onwards, the role of Facebook and Twitter in political uprisings in dodgy countries had been prominent and celebrated. The social-media-fuelled movements often failed, in the end, to achieve much; five months before Mr Nayem put up his post the army had reestablished its power in Egypt, where social media had been crucial to the downfall of General Hosni Mubarak in 2011. But the idea had taken hold that, by connecting people and giving them a voice, social media had become a global force for plurality, democracy and progress.













A few months after the “Euromaidan” protests brought down Mr Yanukovych, a less widely noticed story provided a more disturbing insight into the potential political uses of social media. In August 2014 Eron Gjoni, a computer scientist in America, published a long, rambling blog post about his relationship with Zoe Quinn, a computer-game developer, appearing to imply she had slept with a journalist to get favourable coverage of her new game, “Depression Quest”. The post was the epicentre of “Gamergate”, a misogynistic campaign in which mostly white men keen to bolster each other’s egos let rip against feminists and all the other “social justice warriors” they despised in the world of gaming and beyond. According to some estimates, more than 2m messages with the hashtag #gamergate were sent in September and October 2014.

The campaign used the entire spectrum of social-media tools. Videos, articles and documents leaked to embarrass enemies—a practice known as doxing—were posted to YouTube and blogs. Twitter and Facebook circulated memes. Most people not directly involved were able to ignore it; crucially, the mainstream media, when they noticed it, misinterpreted it. They took Gamergate to be a serious debate, in which both sides deserved to be heard, rather than a right-wing bullying campaign.

Looking at the role that social media have played in politics in the past couple of years, it is the fake-news squalor of Gamergate, not the activist idealism of the Euromaidan, which seems to have set the tone. In Germany the far-right Alternative for Germany party won 12.6% of parliamentary seats in part because of fears and falsehoods spread on social media, such as the idea that Syrian refugees get better benefits than native Germans. In Kenya weaponised online rumours and fake news have further eroded trust in the country’s political system.

This is freaking some people out. In 2010 Wael Ghonim, an entrepreneur and fellow at Harvard University, was one of the administrators of a Facebook page called “We are all Khaled Saeed”, which helped spark the Egyptian uprising centred on Tahrir Square. “We wanted democracy,” he says today, “but got mobocracy.” Fake news spread on social media is one of the “biggest political problems facing leaders around the world”, says Jim Messina, a political strategist who has advised several presidents and prime ministers.

Governments simply do not know how to deal with this—except, that is, for those that embrace it. In the Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte relies on a “keyboard army” to disseminate false narratives. His counterpart in South Africa, Jacob Zuma, also benefits from the protection of trolls. And then there is Russia, which has both a long history of disinformation campaigns and a domestic political culture largely untroubled by concerns of truth. It has taken to the dark side of social media like a rat to a drainpipe, not just for internal use, but for export, too.

Vladimir Putin’s regime has used social media as part of surreptitious campaigns in its neighbours, including Ukraine, in France and Germany, in America and elsewhere. At outfits like the Internet Research Agency professional trolls work 12-hour shifts. Russian hackers set up bots by the thousand to keep Twitter well fed with on-message tweets (they have recently started to tweet assiduously in support of Catalan independence). Sputnik and RT, the government-controlled news agency and broadcaster, respectively, provide stories for the apparatus to spread (during the French election this year Sputnik reported on a totally fictitious poll purporting to put conservative candidate François Fillon at the head of the field).

These stories and incendiary posts bounce between social networks, including Facebook, its subsidiary Instagram, and Twitter. They often perform better than content from real people and media companies. Bots generated one out of every five political messages posted on Twitter in America’s presidential campaign last year. The RAND Corporation, a think-tank, calls this integrated, purposeful system a “firehose of falsehood”.

On November 1st representatives of Facebook, Google and Twitter fielded hostile questions on Capitol Hill about the role they played in helping that firehose drench American voters. The hearings were triggered by reports that during the 2016 campaign Russian-controlled entities bought ads and posted content about divisive political issues that spread virally, in an attempt to sow discord. Facebook has estimated that Russian content on its network, including posts and paid ads, reached 126m Americans, around 40% of the nation’s population.

Given the concentration of power in the market—Facebook and Google account for about 40% of America’s digital content consumption, according to Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research, a data provider—such questions are well worth worrying about. But the concerns about social media run deeper than the actions of specific firms or particular governments.

Social media are a mechanism for capturing, manipulating and consuming attention unlike any other. That in itself means that power over those media—be it the power of ownership, of regulation or of clever hacking—is of immense political importance. Regardless of specific agendas, though, it seems to many that the more information people consume through these media, the harder it will become to create a shared, open space for political discussion—or even to imagine that such a place might exist.

Years ago Jürgen Habermas, a noted German philosopher, suggested that while the connectivity of social media might destabilise authoritarian countries, it would also erode the public sphere in democracies. James Williams, a doctoral student at Oxford University and a former Google employee, now claims that “digital technologies increasingly inhibit our ability to pursue any politics worth having.” To save democracy, he argues, “we need to reform our attention economy.”

The idea of the attention economy is not new. “What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients,” Herbert Simon, a noted economist, wrote in 1971. A “wealth of information,” he added, “creates a poverty of attention.” In “The Attention Merchants”, published in 2016, Tim Wu of Columbia University explains how 20th-century media companies hoovered up ever more of this scarce resource for sale to advertisers, and how Google and its ilk have continued the process.

What are you paying with?

Social media have revolutionised this attention economy in two ways. The first is quantitative. New services and devices have penetrated every nook and cranny of life, sucking up more and more time (see chart 1). The second is qualitative. The new opportunity to share things with the world has made people much more active solicitors of attention, and this has fundamentally shifted the economy’s dynamics.

Interface designers, app-makers and social-media firms employ armies of designers to keep people coming back, according to Tristan Harris, another ex-Googler and co-founder of an advocacy group called “Time Well Spent”. Notifications signalling new followers or new e-mails beg to be tapped on. The now ubiquitous “pull-to-refresh” feature, which lets users check for new content, has turned smartphones into slot machines.

Adult Americans who use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp spend around 20 hours a month on the three services. Overall, Americans touch their smartphones on average more than 2,600 times a day (the heaviest users easily double that). The population of America farts about 3m times a minute. It likes things on Facebook about 4m times a minute.

The average piece of content is looked at for only a few seconds. But it is the overall paying of attention, not the specific information, that matters. The more people use their addictive-by-design social media, the more attention social-media companies can sell to advertisers—and the more data about the users’ behaviour they can collect for themselves. It is an increasingly lucrative business to be in. On November 1st Facebook posted record quarterly profits, up nearly 80% on the same quarter last year. Combined, Facebook and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, control half the world’s digital advertising.

In general, the nature or meaning of the information being delivered does not matter all that much, as long as some attention is being paid. But there is one quality on which the system depends: that information gets shared.

People do not share content solely because it is informative. They share information because they want attention for themselves, and for what the things they share say about them. They want to be heard and seen, and respected. They want posts to be liked, tweets to be retweeted. Some types of information spread more easily this way than others; they pass through social-media networks like viruses—a normally pathological trait which the social-media business is set up to reward.

Because of the data they collect, social-media companies have a good idea of what sort of things go viral, and how to tweak a message until it does. They are willing to share such insights with clients—including with political campaigns versed in the necessary skills, or willing to buy them. The Leave campaign in Britain’s 2016 Brexit referendum was among the pioneers. It served about 1bn targeted digital advertisements, mostly on Facebook, experimenting with different versions and dropping ineffective ones. The Trump campaign in 2016 did much the same, but on a much larger scale: on an average day it fed Facebook between 50,000 and 60,000 different versions of its advertisements, according to Brad Parscale, its digital director. Some were aimed at just a few dozen voters in a particular district.

Perhaps the most subversive techniques, though, are those developed in somewhat obsessive and technically astute coteries of amateurs whose main motivation is fun and recognition, sometimes—but not necessarily—spiked with malice. The internet has always benefited from the attention of such people. In an article entitled “Hacking the Attention Economy” danah boyd (she spells her name in lower case letters), the president of Data & Society, a think-tank, looks at their impact on social media.

In the mid-2000s members of 4chan, a messaging board first used to share manga, anime and pornography, started to explore new ways to manipulate nascent social media. They took particular pleasure in generating “memes”: funny images—often of cats, combined with a clever caption (a genre known as LOLcats)—which could spread like wildfire. They gamed online polls such as the one organised by Time to find the world’s most important people. Ms boyd describes the ways in which such hacks turned political. On and around 4chan, groups which had mostly been excluded from the mainstream media, from white nationalists to men’s rights activists, developed the dark arts they would use to further their agendas. Gamergate was their coming-out party.

The pressure to go vegan

To work at the level of the population as a whole, such social-media operations cannot stand alone. They need mechanisms which can amplify messages developed online, provide the illusion of objectivity, and validate people’s beliefs. Analysis of sharing on Twitter and Facebook, and direct links between stories, shows that a specific subset of America’s media now performs this role for the country’s right wing. Centred on Breitbart, a publication now again run by Steve Bannon, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, and Fox News, a cable channel, this “ecosystem” includes hundreds of other online-only news sites, from Conservapedia, a right-wing Wikipedia, to Infowars, which peddles conspiracy theories. There is a left-wing media ecosystem, too, but it is much less diversified and dominated by mainstream publications, such as the New York Times and CNN.

In France the right-wing ecosystem is called the fachosphere and includes such sites as Fdesouche and Égalité et Réconciliation. Nearly half the links shared during the presidential campaign led to “alternative” sources, according to Bakamo.Social, a consultancy. Although smaller, Germany’s right-wing Paralleluniversum , populated by the likes of Epoch Times and Kopp Online, is gaining ground, says Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a think-tank.

Such ecosystems are a symptom of political polarisation. They also drive it further. The algorithms that Facebook, YouTube and others use to maximise “engagement” ensure users are more likely to see information that they are liable to interact with. This tends to lead them into clusters of like-minded people sharing like-minded things, and can turn moderate views into more extreme ones. “It’s like you start as a vegetarian and end up as a vegan,” says Zeynep Tufekci of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, describing her experience following the recommendations on YouTube. These effects are part of what is increasing America’s political polarisation, she argues (see chart 2).

When putting these media ecosystems to political purposes, various tools are useful. Humour is one. It spreads well; it also differentiates the in-group from the out-group; how you feel about the humour, especially if it is in questionable taste, binds you to one or the other. The best tool, though, is outrage. This is because it feeds on itself; the outrage of others with whom one feels fellowship encourages one’s own. This shared outrage reinforces the fellow feeling; a lack of appropriate outrage marks you out as not belonging. The reverse is also true. Going into the enemy camp and posting or tweeting things that cause them outrage—trolling, in other words—is a great way of getting attention.

Outrage and humour are thus politically powerful; indeed, they played big roles in mobilisations such as that of Tahrir Square and the Euromaidan. They are also easily integrated into rumour campaigns, such as the one about Hillary Clinton’s health in 2016. In August 2016 far-right bloggers started circulating theories that she was suffering from seizures and was physically weak but that, outrageously, the Democrats and their allies in the mainstream media were covering this up.

Video clips mocking her past coughing fits made the rounds online. Conservative media, such as the Drudge Report and Fox News, picked up the story, mainly by asking there’s-smoke-is-there-fire questions. From there it made it into more liberal mainstream outlets. Ms Clinton saw herself compelled to deny the rumours—only to see them gain strength when she indeed developed pneumonia. As the campaign went on, the amount of play such stories got on social media increased (see chart 3).

It would be easy to dismiss such hacks as mere pranks, as misfits showing off their hacking capabilities to one another and the world, just as they did ten years ago on 4chan. But backed up by an alternative media ecosystem keen to support them, and with judicious help from foreign powers capable of organising themselves a little more thoroughly than ragtag mobocrats, they can become powerful. Although the facts quickly supersede the fictions, once an idea is out there, it tends to linger. Efforts to debunk fake news often don’t spread as far, or through the same networks: indeed, they may well be ignored because they come from mainstream media, which many no longer trust. And even if they are not, they are never as engaging as the rumours they seek to replace.

The biggest attention hacker is none other than Mr Trump himself. When he sends one of his outrageous tweets, often adroitly timed to distract from some other controversy, the world pays pathological levels of attention. The president is today’s attention economy made flesh. He reads as little as possible, gets most of his news from cable television, retweets with minimal thought, and his humour makes it very clear what in-group he is in with. Above all, he loves outrage—both causing it and feeling it.

Being this thoroughly part of the system makes Mr Trump eminently hackable. His staff, it is said, compete to try and get ideas they want him to take on board into media they know he will be exposed to. Outsiders can play the game, too. In 2015 enterprising enemies set up a Twitter bot dedicated to sending him tweets with unattributed quotes from Benito Mussolini, Italy’s fascist dictator. Last year Mr Trump finally retweeted one: “It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.” Cue Trump-is-a-fascist outrage.

The tension of history

Social media are hardly the first communication revolution to first threaten, then rewire the body politic. The printing press did it (see our essay on Luther ). So did television and radio, allowing conformity to be imposed in authoritarian countries at the same time as, in more open ones, promoting the norms of discourse which enabled the first mass democracies.

In those democracies broadcasters were often strictly regulated on the basis that the airwaves they used were a public good of limited capacity. One strong argument for not regulating the internet, heard a lot in the 1990s, was that this scarcity of spectrum no longer applied—the internet’s capacity was limitless. Seeing things through the lens of the attention economy, though, suggests that this distinction may not be as sharp as once it seemed. As Simon said, people’s attention—for which, in internet-speak, bandwidth is often used as a metaphor—is scarce.

But there is a raft of problems with justifying greater regulation on these grounds. One is ignorance, and the risk of perverse outcomes that flows from it. As Rasmus Nielsen of Oxford and Roskilde universities argues, not enough is known about the inner workings of social media to come up with effective regulations.

This is in part the fault of the tech companies, which have been less than generous with information about their business. For a firm which used to say its mission was to make the world more open and connected, Facebook is strikingly closed and isolated. It collaborates with researchers looking at the dynamics of social media, but only allows them to publish results, not underlying data. It has been even less willing than Google to share details about how it decides to recommend content or target ads. Both firms have also lobbied to avoid disclosure rules for political ads that conventional media have to comply with, arguing that digital ads lack the space to make clear who paid for a campaign.

Correctly perceiving that public opinion is turning, the companies now say they will be more forthcoming. Facebook and Twitter have volunteered to show the source of any ads that appear in subscribers’ news feeds and develop tools so people can see all the ads that the social-media companies serve to their customers. Whether that is enough to head off legislation remains to be seen: in America a group of senators has introduced the “Honest Ads Act”, which would extend the rules that apply to print, radio and television to social media. Proponents hope it will become law before the 2018 mid-term election.

Some, such as Mr Ghonim, the former Egyptian activist, say that the “Honest Ads Act” does not go far enough. He wants Facebook and other big social-media platforms to be required to maintain a public feed that provides a detailed overview of the information distributed on their networks, such as how far a piece of content has spread and which sorts of users have seen it. “This would allow us to see what is really happening on these platforms,” says Mr Ghonim. Such demands for transparency would extend to requirements to label bots and fake accounts, so users can understand who is behind a message.

Other proposals go beyond transparency. Increased friction is one suggestion, offering users pop-ups with warnings along the lines of: “Do you really want to share this? This news item has been found to be false.” Social-media firms could also start redirecting people to calmer content after they have been engaging with stories that are negative or hostile. YouTube has experimented with redirecting jihadists away from extremist videos to content that contradicts what they have been watching.

Other proposals aim less at dynamics, more at content. As of this October Germany has required social-media companies to take down hate speech, such as Holocaust denial, and fake news within 24 hours or face fines of up to €50m ($58m). The sheer volume of content—more than 500,000 comments are posted on Facebook every minute—makes such policing hard. It is possible, though, that a mixture of better algorithms and more people could achieve something. Facebook has already agreed to hire a few thousand people for this task; it may need a lot more.

Free-speech advocates cringe at the thought that Facebook should be allowed to become the “ministry of truth”—or, for that matter, that companies might surreptitiously steer users activity to quieten them down when they have been angry. As Mr Habermas argues, there is a real value to the openness social media and the internet can bring in restrictive societies. And being angry and unsettled—even outraged—should be a part of that. Some point to China, where it is reported that more than 2m moderators, most employed by social-media firms, scour the networks, erring on the side of caution when they see something that may displease official censors.

A more far-out proposal, which Ms Tufekci favours, is to require social-media firms to change their business model in some way, making their money, perhaps, directly from users, rather than from advertisers. Others argue that the social-media platforms which dominate the attention economy have become utilities and should no longer be run as profit-maximising companies. Mr Wu, the author of “The Attention Merchants”, wants Facebook to become a “public benefit corporation”, obliged by law to aid the public. Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia, could be seen as the model: it lives off donations and its host of volunteers keeps it reasonably clean, honest and reliable. None of this, though, offers a truly satisfactory response to the problem.

Another of Mussolini’s sayings—not yet retweeted by Mr Trump—was that “Democracy is beautiful in theory; in practice it is a fallacy.” As with his preference for the leonine over the sheepish, it is sometimes hard not to sympathise with this, at least a bit. But if, like all political systems, democracy has proved eminently fallible, it has shown itself robustly superior to the rest when it comes to fixing those failings and making good when faced by change. On that basis, history suggests it should be able to weather the storms of social media. But it will not be easy. And, as with books and broadcasts, the process is likely to transform, at least in part, that which it seeks to preserve."
The Economist,But the president’s mysterious announcement raises more questions than it answers,2017-11-03T00:00:00Z,the-economist,Venezuela asks its creditors to renegotiate its vast debt,https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21731019-presidents-mysterious-announcement-raises-more-questions-it-answers-venezuela-asks,https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20171104_AMP501.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"INVESTORS have long seen a default on Venezuelan sovereign debt as a question of when, not if. They have consistently priced its bonds at levels implying that a bankruptcy was imminent, only to be surprised when the cash-strapped oil exporter somehow managed to stay afloat. Now the game at last appears to be up.

On November 2nd Nicolás Maduro, the country’s authoritarian president, announced that he would order a “refinancing and restructuring” of foreign debt worth about $105bn, roughly ten times Venezuela’s foreign-exchange reserves. It would be the second-biggest sovereign default in history; in 2012 Greece restructured $261bn of liabilities. Bonds issued by the government and PDVSA, the state oil company, fell by 25%-40% on the news.

Analysts are scratching their heads as to what Mr Maduro has in mind—or if he has a plan at all. In the same speech in which he declared his intent to refinance the debt, the president also proclaimed that PDVSA would pay its final instalment of $1.2bn on a bond that matured on November 2nd. Just a week earlier, the company also made good on a $842m payment of principal amortisation. If Venezuela were really preparing to renege on its debts, having an extra $2bn in the bank would surely come in handy during contentious negotiations with lenders. “You don’t pay a billion dollars, and then say ‘screw the bondholders’,” says Ray Zucaro of RVX Asset Management, a Florida-based investment firm that holds Venezuelan bonds.

Mr Maduro’s brief, cryptic statement provides little indication of what concrete steps he will take. The closest precedent is the Argentine crash of 2001, when the government in Buenos Aires simply stopped making payments on $82bn of debt. Unlike Argentina, however, Venezuela is a petro-state that holds valuable property abroad, including Citgo, a refiner in the United States, and a fleet of oil tankers. If the country tried to follow in Argentina’s footsteps, foreign creditors might be able to seize those assets. That would severely disrupt PDVSA’s operations, and could cause the Venezuelan economy, which has shrunk by over a third since 2013, to collapse even further.

The president invited banks, bondholders, and “everyone involved in foreign debt” to the country to take part in talks, theoretically scheduled for November 13th. The chances of a consensual workout, however, appear to be nil.

First, it would have to exclude American investors. The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela in August, after Mr Maduro replaced the opposition-controlled national assembly with a sham parliament he calls a “constituent assembly”. The measures forbid entities under American jurisdiction from owning any new bonds issued by Venezuela or PDVSA. That would prevent them from exchanging existing bonds for new ones in a restructuring deal.

The United States’ Treasury department has also designated Tareck El Aissami, Mr Maduro’s vice-president, as a drug kingpin (Mr Aissami denies the charge). As a result, Americans cannot have any contact with him, which could stop negotiations before they get started since Mr Maduro has named Mr El Aissami the head of his new debt-restructuring committee. Moreover, bondholders from outside the United States would hardly be amenable to a settlement in which the cost of a haircut falls entirely on them, while American creditors are made whole.

Observers who give the president credit for thinking at least one step ahead have floated a number of plausible theories for his perplexing decision to pay today and renegotiate tomorrow. One interpretation is that Mr Maduro may hope to continue paying debts owed by PDVSA, which provides 95% of the country’s foreign income, while welching on those contracted by the Venezuelan state itself. The government’s vulnerable assets abroad are technically held by PDVSA rather than by the Republic of Venezuela. And the government’s bonds, unlike some of PDVSA’s, all include “collective-action clauses”, which prevent individual creditors from blocking a deal that a super-majority of lenders are willing to agree on.

However, foreign courts are likely to look askance at any effort by Mr Maduro to pick and choose which lenders to snub, since PDVSA is widely regarded as being indistinguishable from its owner. Asdrúbal Oliveros, a Venezuelan economist, recently tweeted that a “selective” default is “practically impossible”.

Another theory is that Mr Maduro may have intended to send the prices of his country’s debt tumbling. A sell-off would enable either Venezuela or its foreign patrons, primarily Russia and China, to buy back the obligations cheaply. That, in turn, would allow Venezuela to retire its debt at lower cost, or to put it in the hands of sympathetic allies.

A more conspiratorial explanation has been mooted by Javier Ruíz of “Caracas Chronicles”, an opposition-friendly blog. The government had spooked markets by making use of 30-day grace periods to delay a series of interest payments, causing their prices to fall. Noting high trading volumes in the bond that Mr Maduro said would be paid on November 2nd, Mr Ruíz wondered whether the government might have informed well-connected insiders that it planned to settle up this obligation in full. If true, that would have ensured that friendly cronies made the final stop on the Venezuelan-debt gravy train before payments ceased.

Whatever the explanation, it is clear that Mr Maduro is trying to pin as much of the blame as possible on Donald Trump. He devoted much of his speech to denouncing “the global financial dictatorship of American imperialism”, and complained of a “genuine financial blockade”. The United States has certainly made it harder for Venezuela to fulfil its obligations: several Venezuelan businesses have reported that international banks have rejected or delayed their dollar payments in recent months, at the bidding of compliance departments concerned about falling on the wrong side of American law.

Mr Maduro says that his treasury’s bond payments have been held up for the same reason. In practice, though, America’s sanctions on Venezuela are modest. In contrast with Cuba, the target of a long-standing trade embargo, Venezuela still enjoys open trade with the United States and sells much of its oil to America.

The end of the oil boom in 2014, profligate public spending and systematic corruption have exacerbated Venezuela’s fiscal woes. But ultimately, the reason that a country with more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia is hopelessly insolvent is the destruction of its private sector by Mr Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez."

Mr Trump has referred to Mr Najib as “my favourite prime minister”. Mr Trump’s presidency has coincided with a lurch towards authoritarianism around South-East Asia. Such matters seem to be far less of a concern to him, however, than they were to his predecessor, Barack Obama. For the region’s democrats, the discrepancy stings.

On his visit to Asia next week, Mr Trump will call on Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, who has boasted about killing people and has instituted a campaign against drug dealers and users that has led to perhaps 9,000 deaths. Mr Trump apparently commended Mr Duterte in a phone call earlier this year for doing an “unbelievable job” fighting drugs. Mr Trump will also visit Vietnam to attend a big international summit in Danang next week, ahead of which the Communist Party is repressing dissent especially fiercely.













Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand are all expected to hold elections in the next year, which their current leaders are preparing to manipulate in various ways to prolong their grip on power. American pressure might have helped restrain them; the lack of it seems likely to embolden them. They can certainly count on China for support. As the region becomes increasingly illiberal, journalists and opposition politicians are suffering. Mere social-media posts land government critics in court and in jail.

Admittedly, America has never been especially forceful about promoting human rights and democracy in South-East Asia. Its diplomats continue to condemn abuses in much the manner they always have. But these days, they say, they struggle to convince locals that their country cares.

American warships do still conduct freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, helping to resist China’s expansive territorial claims there, points out Ian Storey of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, a think-tank in Singapore. But America does not seem to have a broader plan to counter Chinese influence in South-East Asia, or to promote its own values in the region. One of Mr Obama’s tools for doing that had been the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, which would have obliged Vietnam, for example, to allow independent trade unions. Mr Trump’s first big Asian initiative was to withdraw from TPP. In its place, he seems to imagine a system of warm personal ties with the region’s many strongmen."
The Economist,An attempt to enliven plane journeys fails to impress flyers,2017-11-03T18:10:32Z,the-economist,Southwest Airlines tries to bring music concerts to the skies,https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2017/11/hitting-wrong-note,https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20171104_BLP513.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"LAST week brought some good news for those who are fans of both flying and country music. Warner Music Nashville, a record label, and Southwest Airlines announced that they will be bringing concerts to the skies. The scheme is an expansion of the airline’s existing “Live at 35” series, in which bands surprise passengers by playing a few songs in the plane’s cabin. Devin Dawson (pictured), an artist on the label, marked the occasion with a performance on a flight from Nashville to Philadelphia. He told Billboard , a music publication, that:

Some people don’t really enjoy flying; some people get very nervous and don’t like it. I hope that something like this [performance] is just a cool surprise for some [passengers] that helps them forget about their everyday woes, and I’ll just play a couple of songs to make them smile.













However, Mr Dawson’s enthusiasm was not shared by everyone. The reactions on social media were swift and brutal. The New York Daily News tweeted that the carrier is forcing passengers to listen to in-flight music live “because air travel isn’t torture enough”. Vice ran the headline : “Southwest Airlines will regularly inflict live music on trapped passengers”. Frequent flyers asked how there could possibly be space for a band to perform, when airlines are cramming seats into every available inch of their planes. Business travellers complained about the distraction. Some vowed never to fly Southwest again.

This is an example of airlines’ trying to make flying fun. (Other attempts include using ever-catchier safety videos or even making flight attendants perform dance numbers, as Gulliver has previously reported .) But the problem is that most travellers just want to get from one location to another with minimal hassle. Many business travellers reported in a recent survey that they prefer to avoid human interaction altogether when in transit. And although a concert is not an interaction, in some ways it is far worse. There is no way to cut off the conversation. Sleeping through it is a near-impossible challenge. Reading or working is harder still.

Though misguided, the airlines’ attempts to enliven flights are understandable. Travellers tend to choose their carriers on the basis of price and convenience, even if they complain about the food or service along the way. That forces airlines to find cheap ways to attract customers without denting profit margins. A live concert seems like an affordable and potentially enjoyable gimmick. After all, if videos of the performances go viral, Southwest could become known as the “fun” airline.

But most travellers do not want fun. They want quiet and they want reliability. Even though these qualities are harder for airlines to provide, they will make customers more satisfied—and perhaps more loyal too."
The Economist,"Raised speaking Polish and French, Joseph Conrad didn’t learn English until he was 21. But he became one of the finest of English writers",2017-11-02T15:51:20Z,the-economist,"Joseph Conrad, the first novelist of globalisation",https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21730850-raised-speaking-polish-and-french-joseph-conrad-didnt-learn-english-until-he-was-21,https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171104_BKP005_0.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"The Dawn Watch: Joseph Conrad in a Global World. By Maya Jasanoff. Penguin Press; 400 pages; $30. William Collins; £25.

JOSEPH CONRAD was a phenomenon. Born to Polish parents in 1857 in a part of the Russian empire that is now Ukraine, he was christened Jozef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski. French was his second language, and he did not come to England (or speak a word of English) until he was 21. Yet such was his eventual mastery of the language that he has come to be regarded as one of the greatest writers in English.













In 1948 F.R. Leavis, a well-known literary critic at Cambridge University, listed him in “The Great Tradition” as being up there with Jane Austen, George Eliot and Henry James. Eight years later Walter Allen, another critic, wrote that “Nostromo” was arguably “the greatest novel in English of this century”. “Heart of Darkness” gained a new audience through “Apocalypse Now”, Francis Ford Coppola’s epic war film of 1979.

Yet readers today are often deterred by Conrad’s convoluted, prolix style. This is a pity. Many of his novels and short stories richly reward perseverance. As Maya Jasanoff, professor of British and imperial history at Harvard University, argues in a new book that blends history and literary criticism, Conrad wrote “at the turn of the 20th century” of many of the global forces and perils that afflict the world today.

The novelist was orphaned at 11, his parents having succumbed to illness after being exiled for revolutionary activity to “the gates of Siberia”. At 16 he ran away to sea. For nearly 20 years he worked as an ordinary seaman from Marseille where, suffering from debt and despair, he appears to have attempted suicide. Later he became a fully qualified British master mariner, and travelled the world, particularly the archipelagoes and peninsulas of South-East Asia, where many of his tales are set. Conrad, Ms Jasanoff writes, “belonged to the last generation of seafarers who worked primarily on sailing ships”, which he called “the aristocracy”. In his writings he “transformed the British sailing ship into a gold standard for moral conduct”.

Sailing to Australia as first mate on the Torrens , he befriended John Galsworthy, a young lawyer who went on to write “The Forsyte Saga”, which eventually won him a Nobel prize. Then, in 1894, with no command in view, Conrad abandoned the sea and published his first novel, “Almayer’s Folly”. The journey from native-born Pole to sailor to writer was complete. Two years later, after a short, awkward courtship, he married the seemingly unsuitable Jessie George, settled contentedly in Kent, fathered two sons and dedicated the rest of his life to writing.

In “The Dawn Watch” Ms Jasanoff describes her own journeys in search of Conrad—four weeks on a French cargo ship across the Indian Ocean and a complicated trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo. She skilfully integrates details of Conrad’s life and accounts of his four greatest works, linking the challenges and forces that lie behind and within the novels to those of the 21st century.

If not as cosmopolitan as today, London in the 1890s contained 50,000 continental Europeans—“more than all the population of Krakow”. (Conrad might be curious to know that Poles are now the largest foreign-born group in Britain.) Russian revolutionaries and militant Irish nationalists inspired “The Secret Agent”, set in a grimy, Dickensian London, an ironic treatment of plotting and terrorism and a bomb that goes off at the wrong moment, killing an innocent simpleton. Then, as now, the threats of anarchism and terrorism fuelled anti-immigrant feeling. As Ms Jasanoff writes: “When you think a foreigner might take your job, you protest. When you think a foreigner might kill you, you panic.”

If “The Secret Agent” is told in an easily readable manner, “Lord Jim”, which had come out seven years earlier, is altogether more exotic and demanding. Captain Marlow, Conrad’s recurrent narrator, describes how in a moment of confusion a “powerfully built” young Englishman abandons a ship loaded with pilgrims that appears to be sinking. Conscience-stricken and haunted, Jim repeatedly tries to make a new start, but just when he appears to be prospering he is destroyed. This meandering narrative, Ms Jasanoff writes, “spoke in a metaphor [that] imperialists could appreciate”, in particular about the moral uprightness of “the right sort” of Englishman. It was recognised as having great originality and inspired many younger writers, though not everyone was convinced. For E.M. Forster, “the secret casket of his genius contained a vapour rather than a jewel.” But Ms Jasanoff states that “for Conrad, the vapour was the jewel.”

“Heart of Darkness”, which came out in 1902, two years after “Lord Jim”, arose from Conrad’s brief and sickening experience of Belgian exploitation of the then Belgian Congo. He was appalled by the treatment of the Africans and the ivory trade, as exemplified in the novel by Kurtz, the agent who came promising civilisation but turned to vile savagery and eventually expired, uttering the words, “The horror! The horror!”

Conrad expressed similar concerns in the more substantial “Nostromo” of 1904. For the first time he wrote about an imaginary place, the South American republic of Costaguana, but it was “a novel about every place he’d been”. It projected all his political cynicism, his nostalgia for a pre-technological age and his fears for a future dominated by “material interests”.

Ms Jasanoff says she set out to explore Conrad’s world “with the compass of a historian, the chart of a biographer, and the navigational sextant of a fiction reader”, and these have served her well. Anthony Powell, a novelist, once described Conrad as “an enigmatic figure. The more we read about him, the less we seem to know him.” This biography may not fully reveal the mystery behind the man, but it is a powerful encouragement to read his books."
The Economist,"Neither bird, nor plane, this is A/2017 U1",2017-11-03T09:35:50Z,the-economist,How astronomers identified the first visitor from another solar system,https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/11/economist-explains-2,https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20171104_BLP507.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"ON October 19th Rob Weryk of the University of Hawaii saw something rather strange. In pictures produced by Pan-STARRS 1, a telescope on Haleakala, he identified an unusually fast-moving, faint object that he concluded could not have originated in Earth’s solar system. It was travelling at more than 25km per second. That is too fast for it to have a closed, elliptical orbit around the Sun. Nor could its velocity have been the result of the extra gravitational kick provided by an encounter with a planet, since it arrived from well above the ecliptic plane near which all the Sun’s planets orbit. Indeed, after swinging around the Sun, it passed about 25m km below Earth, before speeding back above the ecliptic plane. Observations from other telescopes have now confirmed that Dr Weryk’s object is the first extrasolar object to be spied by astronomers.

The object was originally classified as a comet and thus named C/2017 U1 (the “C” stands for comet). But it lacked the tail of gas and dust produced when these icy rocks fly close to the Sun. Furthermore, an analysis of the sunlight it reflected suggested that the surface is mostly rock. So it has now been classified as an asteroid, A/2017 U1, which, judging from its brightness, is about 400 metres wide. This is puzzling. Comets are formed on the cold periphery of distant solar systems. Asteroids reside within such systems’ interiors, where any comet-like volatiles will have been driven off by the heat of their parent stars. Models of planet formation suggest that interstellar objects such as A/2017 U1 are more usually comets, as they can be more easily dislodged from their orbits than asteroids.













One explanation is that over many millennia cosmic rays have transformed the icy, volatile chemicals that would be expected to stream off a comet into more stable compounds. Another is that the Sun is not the first star A/2017 U1 has chanced upon, and its volatile materials were boiled off by previous stellar encounters. Or it could indeed be that the object was rocky to begin with—perhaps once orbiting its parent star in an equivalent of our solar system’s asteroid belt, before its ejection by an encounter with a Jupiter-like planet.

Why, then, has nothing like A/2017 U1 been seen before? Those planet-formation theories suggest such objects should be a reasonably common sight. Perhaps the theories are wrong. Or perhaps these interstellar visitors have been overlooked in the past, and A/2017 U1 will now inspire a spate of such sightings in future. Sadly for astronomers, A/2017 U1 may not be visible long enough for these questions to be resolved decisively. It is now charging out of the solar system towards the constellation of Pegasus—at 44km per second. Small uncertainties in the calculation of its trajectory may mean that where exactly it came from and where it is heading will remain a mystery."
The Economist,The bill would scrap or limit many inefficient loopholes. But it would cost too much,2017-11-02T21:22:45Z,the-economist,A lot to like and a lot to dislike in the Republican tax bill,https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/11/bill-two-halves,https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20171104_USP505.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"A DEBATE has raged this year about whether the Republican effort on taxes should be described as “tax reform”—which implies improving efficiency and fairness–or just “tax cuts”. Parts of the tax bill released, at long last, by House Republicans on November 2nd are worthy of the first title. The tax bill aggressively takes on deductions in the individual income tax code, and channels the proceeds towards across-the-board cuts in income tax. Unfortunately, that good work is undone by expensive giveaways to the owners of firms, and unnecessary windfalls to the heirs of the rich. As a result, the bill would saddle the economy with more debt, and could end up being a drag on growth.

Start with the good stuff. Republicans want to mostly scrap the state and local deduction, an unwarranted federal subsidy for states that levy high taxes (see article). Displaying an admirable willingness to go after even popular tax breaks, they would curtail the deduction for mortgage interest payments, which flows mostly to the rich and distorts the economy towards housing. The deduction would be limited to $500,000 of mortgage borrowing, down from $1m today. Numerous smaller deductions would go too. And a big increase in the standard deduction, the amount that can be earned before paying tax, will greatly reduce the incentive to take advantage of itemised deductions in the first place (Americans must pick one or the other).

That all makes the tax code more efficient, and helps to pay for across-the-board cuts in marginal tax rates. Contrary to Democrats’ talking points, most middle-class families can expect to see a tax cut, although some families with children will probably lose out owing to the scrapping of personal exemptions (amounts that can be earned tax-free on account of household size). Meanwhile, the top income tax rate of 39.6% would stay in place, though it would kick in at $1m for married couples, rather than $470,000 under current law.













The problem is that Republicans plan bigger cuts to business taxes than are affordable, especially after abandoning plans to raise money via so-called “border-adjustment”. The corporate tax rate would fall to 20%, permanently, at great expense. The rate for so-called “pass-through” businesses, whose owners, unlike shareholders in corporations, need not pay further taxes on their investment profits, would be 25%. This, and the abolition of the estate (inheritance) tax, which only falls on estates worth more than $5.5m, all contribute to the supposed $1.5trn cost of the bill over ten years.

In the long run, the addition to the national debt will crowd out private investment and inhibit economic growth. The Tax Policy Center modelled the earlier sketch plan put out by Republicans and found that after four decades, GDP would be 0.4% lower, because of the increased debt burden. This is one reason to be suspicious of the White House’s claim that corporate tax cuts will cause wages to rise by $4,000 for the average family. The American economy is approaching full employment and does not need a fiscal stimulus package (on this point, I would recommend the Tax Foundation’s blog on the “folk theory” of how tax cuts help the economy). The House Republicans’ tax bill has plenty of good features. But its lack of fiscal prudence is its undoing."
The Economist,The judge’s action may help the separatist cause,2017-11-03T00:00:00Z,the-economist,Eight Catalan leaders are jailed,https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21731017-judges-action-may-help-separatist-cause-eight-catalan-leaders-are-jailed,https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20171104_EUP505_1.jpg,business,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"TO MANY in Catalonia it looks like politicised justice. To many elsewhere in Spain it is merely the overdue application of the rule of law to serial abusers of it. What is clear is that the decision on November 2nd by a high-court judge to jail eight members of the sacked Catalan government, pending trial on charges of rebellion, sedition and misappropriation of funds, will have political consequences.

The court case follows the illegal declaration of Catalan independence on October 27th, orchestrated by the separatist regional administration of Carles Puigdemont. In response, Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, invoked Article 155 of Spain’s constitution to impose direct rule in Catalonia, sack Mr Puigdemont and his 13 counsellors and call a regional election for December 21st.

Now the courts have weighed in. In her ruling Judge Carmen Lamela justified the jailings by the seriousness of the charges—rebellion carries up to 25 years in prison—and the risk that the defendants might flee. That is indeed what Mr Puigdemont and four of his counsellors have done, turning up in Brussels this week from where they are likely to contest European extradition warrants which the judge is poised to issue.













Acting to overthrow the constitutional order is a criminal matter in Spain, as elsewhere in continental Europe. Judge Lamela wrote that the defendants, in their unilateral and illegal pursuit of independence, had deliberately engaged in “the systematic flouting of resolutions of the Constitutional Tribunal” and “collective resistance to the legitimate authority of the state”. But many lawyers question whether their actions amounted to “rebellion”, a crime aimed at military coups.

Ms Lamela’s harshness contrasted with the approach of the Supreme Court, which is trying Carme Forcadell, the Speaker of the Catalan parliament and five others who enjoy parliamentary privilege. They remain free, having been granted an extra week to prepare their defence.

In Catalonia, the anger and disquiet at the jailings go well beyond the pro-independence camp. The ruling was “only explicable by the spirit of revenge, and its aim is to humiliate”, said Ada Colau, the left-wing but non-separatist, mayor of Barcelona.

Spain’s judiciary, however, is fiercely independent. The High Court has jailed members of Mr Rajoy’s People’s Party (PP) for corruption (and recently summoned the prime minister himself as a witness in a corruption trial). By inflaming Catalan opinion just when the campaign for the regional election is about to begin, Judge Lamela has done Mr Rajoy no favours. “The government is very worried by the ruling,” says a source close to the PP. “It likes the Supreme Court’s approach”. He hopes that in the next couple of weeks the Supreme Court will opt to take charge of both cases, as it has the legal power to do.

The signs had been that the separatist coalition would fall apart ahead of the regional election, and that its two main component parties would downplay independence. That is now less certain. The social movements that support independence are poised to call a protest strike. The jailings “turn the election into a plebiscite on the central government,” wrote Enric Juliana in La Vanguardia , a Barcelona newspaper. If it remains so, Mr Rajoy may well lose it."

Xi Jinping, the president of China, is “adapting Marxism to the Chinese context”, as the People’s Daily puts it. During the financial crisis of 2008-09 sales of “Capital”, Marx’s most significant work, soared; after Jeremy Corbyn’s election as leader of Britain’s Labour Party , sales of the “Communist Manifesto” spiked.

Lately anyone looking to familiarise themselves with Marx’s thought has been spoilt for choice. Last year saw the publication of Gareth Stedman Jones’s “Karl Marx: Greatness and Illusion” , probably the defining guide to Marx’s philosophy and economics. Someone looking to understand Marx the man, though, should see “Young Marx”, directed by Nicholas Hytner.













The play, which opened in October, is the first to be staged at the new Bridge Theatre in London, a stone’s throw from Tower Bridge. It is a modest but impressive venue. The acoustics in the auditorium are excellent; at the interval, the smell of freshly baked, Proust-bitingly-good madeleines wafts in.

“Young Marx” is a fitting opener for the new theatre. Set largely in Soho in 1850, it is a portrait of how Marx lived day to day. The great man (played convincingly by Rory Kinnear) is dirt-poor and always on the run from the police. He is boorish and arrogant, a smoker, a drinker, a womaniser.

The phrase “young Marx” is used by scholars to refer to a period of the man’s life, before around 1855, when he believed that the rejection of capitalism would lead to complete freedom. Later in his life Marx had questioned this naive understanding of freedom, in effect asking: “even if we get rid of capitalism, won’t some other oppressive structure simply take its place?” (In the jargon, these are the ideas of the “mature Marx”.)

In this play, Marx is very “young”. He enthusiastically tries to engage everyone he meets in debates about capitalism. He believes that a better world is possible, even inevitable, and tries to convince everyone of that fact.

The play is not plot-heavy but rather is composed of a series of vignettes: a duel on Hampstead Heath; a fight in the British Museum; squabbles among other revolutionaries. For that reason it has been criticised for being wandering, even directionless. That is to miss the point, however. Its great contribution is to show how Marx’s life influenced his work.

Take his relationship with Friedrich Engels (played by Oliver Chris). In the popular understanding, Marx is head and shoulders above Engels; the latter is just a hanger-on. In “Young Marx” Engels himself seems to agree, all stooped and deferent in front of his chest-puffing compatriot. He refers to himself as the “beta-plus” to Marx’s “alpha”.

Yet the play also shows that Marx could not have done it alone. Engels agrees to give Marx a stipend, freeing him from wage-labour and allowing him instead to work on “Capital”. One of the most convincing scenes comes when Engels implores Marx to go to Manchester and do some empirical research. He castigates Marx for having failed to visit a factory, or having really tried to understand how the working classes in England lived at the time. Marx promises to improve. It is generally agreed by historians that without Engels’s intervention, Marx’s work would have remained overly theoretical and detached—and significantly less influential. “Young Marx” demonstrates this brilliantly.

The play is not flawless. At times, Marxist theory seems to be shoe-horned in, as in the first scene when Marx explains the difference between use- and exchange-value to a baffled pawn-shop owner. (Anyone without a fairly strong grasp of the theory may be equally confused at that point.) Some of the scenes go on too long. Yet for anyone looking to get a measure of the man, you will not do much better than this."

In an extraordinary allegation, the former prime minister states that a secret US intelligence report into Iraq’s military capabilities was never passed to Britain and could have changed the course of events. The revelation leads Brown to conclude that the “war could not be justified as a last resort and invasion cannot now be seen as a proportionate response”.

Tony Blair prosecution over Iraq war blocked by judges Read more

He adds that the evidence in question was never examined by the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war, which concluded that Britain chose to join the invasion before “peaceful options for disarmament” had been exhausted. Brown’s intervention will reopen the debate about Britain’s decision to join the US-led invasion of Iraq. Tony Blair used the assertion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction to argue that Britain needed to join the military action.

Brown makes the claim in his new book, My Life, Our Times, published this week. He writes that there was a “rush to war” in March 2003, adding that he asks himself “over and over whether I could have made more of a difference before that fateful decision was taken”.

He said that as chancellor he had little more access to intelligence than other cabinet ministers, but was reassured by MI6 that evidence about WMDs was well-founded. However, having reviewed the evidence since leaving office, he writes that he now believes “we were all misled on the existence of WMDs”.

Brown points to a crucial set of papers from September 2002, commissioned by the then US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and held by the US defence department, which was leaked last year. According to Brown, it made clear that evidence of “the existence of WMDs was weak, even negligible and in key areas nonexistent”.

It is astonishing that none of us in the British government ever saw this American report

“It is astonishing that none of us in the British government ever saw this American report,” Brown writes. “It is now clear how forcibly this report challenged the official view: ‘We’ve struggled to estimate the unknown … We range from 0% to about 75% knowledge on various aspects of their [Iraq’s WMD] program’,” the report stated.

“It conceded that US knowledge of the Iraqi nuclear weapons programme was based largely – perhaps 90% of it – on analysis of imprecise intelligence. These assessments, the report said, relied ‘heavily on analytic assumptions and judgment rather than hard evidence. The evidentiary base is particularly sparse for Iraqi nuclear programs.’

“The Iraqis, it was reported, ‘lack the precursors for sustained nerve-agent production’, confirming that US intelligence could not identify any Iraqi sites producing the final chemical agent. And as for missiles and the Iraqis’ ability to target countries such as the UK with them, which was to be the subject of dramatic claims only a few weeks later, Rumsfeld was informed: ‘We doubt all processes are in place to produce longer-range missiles’.

Gordon Brown: Bankers should have been jailed for role in financial crisis Read more

“This highly confidential US evidence was a refutation not only of the claim that Iraq was producing WMDs but also of their current capability to do so.”

Brown states that had the evidence been shared, history could have been different. “I am convinced that if resolutions of the United Nations are approved unanimously and repeatedly they have to be upheld if we are to have a safe and stable world order,” he writes. “On this basis, Saddam Hussein’s continuing failure to comply with them justified international action against him.

“The question is whether it required war in March 2003. If I am right that somewhere within the American system the truth about Iraq’s lack of weapons was known, then we were not just misinformed but misled on the critical issue of WMDs.

“Given that Iraq had no usable chemical, biological or nuclear weapons that it could deploy and was not about to attack the coalition, then two tests of a just war were not met: war could not be justified as a last resort and invasion cannot now be seen as a proportionate response.”

The former prime minister also reveals that the moment he took office in 2007, he planned to pull British troops out of Iraq well before the Americans. He eventually withdrew troops in April 2009, while the US stayed until December 2011. “At this time I made another decision: not to use our future departure from Iraq as an occasion to draw a contrast with Tony or score points against him either,” he writes."

And has there ever been a prime minister more in need of the reflected glow of Jacindamania than Malcolm Turnbull?

Bundled into the tight confines of Kirribilli House on a wet November morning in Sydney, a largish press pack tried not to catch cold while Australian PM Turnbull did his best to warm a relationship that has recently turned chilly.



Australia and New Zealand, Turnbull said after his first “candid” meeting with his new counterpart Jacinda Ardern, have been “partners in freedom’s cause forever”. The two countries “trust each other totally”, and their two leaders get on “very well”.

Turnbull says he will consider NZ refugee deal only after US resettlements Read more

“We’re family,” he insisted.

“Quite literally,” Ardern agreed.



They are not, quite literally, family, but the metaphor still seems apt. Just as you can’t choose your family, Turnbull has precious little say over who gets elected on the other side of the ditch. Barnaby Joyce might argue that it’s less clear the arrangement works both ways – but, as Ardern seemed to intimate, when it comes to family it’s often best to say nothing at all. In any event, those halcyon days kayaking in Sydney Harbour with John Key seemed particularly far away as the rain fell on Sunday.

Asked whether she had raised with Turnbull Julie Bishop’s comments before the New Zealand election – that Australia would find it “very hard to build trust” with NZ Labour if it won government after it involved itself in the issue of Barnaby Joyce’s citizenship – Ardern spoke like someone determined to avoid another punch-up at Christmas lunch. “They weren’t raised,” she told the press. “I think that speaks to the strength of the relationship. I don’t see those events of the past being relevant to our current relationship, which I see as being strong.”

And on that whole citizenship thing? “I would contend that it actually has absolutely nothing to do with New Zealand and nor has it ever had anything to do with New Zealand,” Ardern said. Indeed.

It’s hard to find quite the right way to describe the Turnbull government’s relationship with chaos, but the low-key sense of anticipation that seemed to hang around Kirribilli House as puddles formed on the presumably important floorboards seems to come close. From the Manus Island refugee calamity, into which Kevin Andrews saw fit to insert himself on Sunday, to New Zealand’s hand-wringing over investor state dispute settlement clauses in the gaffer-taped Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the aforementioned (but unmentionable) diplomatic snafu over citizenship, the Tasman seems all of a sudden to be filled with underwater mines.

Of course Ardern didn’t so much win her election as wrangle the result into something resembling a government – which in today’s electoral politics seems about the best anyone can hope for. And in lieu of kayaking, it was perhaps something the two of them could genuinely bond over."

Malcolm Turnbull says he will “consider” New Zealand’s offer to take refugees from the Manus Island detention centre, but only once the government has completed its refugee transfer arrangement with the US.

The Australian prime minister met with his New Zealand counterpart at Kirribilli House in Sydney on Sunday, and Jacinda Ardern confirmed she had restated her country’s offer to accept 150 refugees from among the almost 600 still holding out on Manus Island.

Turnbull had been expected to reject the offer, and said his government was “not taking it up at this time”.

However he left the door open for a future agreement, saying the government would consider the deal once it had completed the ongoing transfer of refugees to the US.



“What we are seeking to do is to ensure that there are opportunities for resettlement on the people on Manus Island and Nauru. As you know we have an arrangement United States whereby a substantial number of about 1,250 can … be resettled in the United States.

“We want to pursue those, conclude those arrangements and then in the wake of that obviously we can consider other [resettlement deals].”

Ardern ruled out making the refugee resettlement offer directly to the Papua New Guinean government, saying there was “no need” because the offer was under “active consideration” by Australia.

“I absolutely understand the priority that has been placed around the agreement with the United States,” she said.

“Of course from the New Zealand perspective we want [our] offer to remain on the table so that we can assist as much as we’re able in expediting a resolution on this issue.”

But Turnbull also suggested the government would not look favourably on arrangements that increased the likelihood of asylum seekers arriving by boat.

“I just want to emphasise that we know what the alternative looks like,” he said. “Tens of thousands of unlawful arrivals and over 1,000 men, women and children drowning at sea.

“We have put the people smugglers out of business and we will keep them out of business.”

Sunday was the first face-to-face meeting between Turnbull and Ardern, who became New Zealand’s new Labour prime minister last month.

As well as the Manus deal, in a two-hour meeting they discussed the future of the now 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, and concerns about the stability of the North Korean regime.

Ardern said they did not talk about foreign minister Julie Bishop’s comments before the election in August that the Australian government would find it “very hard to build trust” with a Labour government after an extraordinary diplomatic spat over claims about the then opposition party’s role in Barnaby Joyce’s citizenship saga.

Australia and Japan have been leading the charge to save the controversial trade deal since the US president, Donald Trump, withdrew his country’s support in January.

New Zealand has remained committed to the TPP, but Ardern has raised concerns about investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses which allow private companies to sue signatory governments before an international tribunal if they think the government has introduced or changed laws that significantly hurt their interests.

While acknowledging the benefits of the TPP, Ardern said it would “not stop us from pursuing the ISDS clause as far as we are able”.

“It is something I have made clear domestically and it is something I think the population would like to pursue to make sure we are protecting New Zealand’s domestic best interests,” she said.

Earlier on Sunday, the Liberal backbencher Kevin Andrews broke ranks to lend his support to the idea of sending refugees to New Zealand to help end the standoff on Manus Island.



More than 600 refugees have barricaded themselves in the mothballed detention centre, which closed on Tuesday.

“We should give consideration to what New Zealand is offering,” former immigration minister Kevin Andrews told Sky News on Sunday. “It’s a difficult problem but we should not rule out any particular solution.”

He acknowledged there were concerns about a New Zealand refugee resettlement deal establishing a pull factor for people making boat journeys or becoming a back door to Australia.

But Andrews said if a deal could be crafted to work around those issues it should be given thorough consideration.

The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, believes the government should accept the offer.



New Zealand, which takes a total of 750 refugees a year, first made its resettlement offer in 2013, to the then Labor Gillard government.

The offer has been rejected more than once on the grounds it would give asylum seekers a backdoor into Australia and become a marketing opportunity for people smugglers. Overnight, one refugee was reportedly experiencing heart problems.

The former head of the Democratic National Committee says she considered initiating effort to replace Hillary Clinton as the party’s presidential nominee with then vice-president Joe Biden.

Donna Brazile makes the revelation in a memoir being released on Tuesday entitled Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House.

Brazile writes that she considered initiating Clinton’s removal after she collapsed while leaving a 9/11 memorial service in New York City. Clinton later acknowledged she was suffering from pneumonia.

But Brazile says the larger issue was that her campaign was “anemic” and had taken on “the odor of failure”.

After considering a dozen combinations to replace Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine from Virginia, Brazile writes that she settled on Biden and Cory Booker of New Jersey as those with the best chance of defeating Trump.

Ultimately, the former DNC head says, “I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them.”

It was unclear whether Biden was willing to step into the race or even whether he discussed the idea with Brazile. A spokesman for the former vice-president did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Brazile writes that on 12 September 2016, the day after Clinton collapsed, Biden’s chief of staff called saying the vice-president wanted to speak with her and that her thought at the time was “Gee, I wonder what he wanted to talk to me about?”

As for Brazile’s powers to determine the party’s candidate, she writes that as party chair she would oversee the process of replacing a nominee who became disabled.

Brazile writes she believed a joint fundraising agreement signed between Clinton and the DNC “looked unethical” and she felt Clinton had too much influence on the party during a competitive Democratic primary with rival Bernie Sanders.

During the nomination process for the 2016 election Democrats argued among themselves over whether Clinton was being given an unfair advantage over Sanders, a Vermont independent who sought the party’s nomination with the backing of its more liberal members.

On Saturday, DNC Chairman Tom Perez issued a statement saying he and the DNC leadership were committed to ensuring the nomination process in 2020 will be “unquestionably fair and transparent”.

Among the reforms he said he developed after listening to Democrats across the party spectrum was ensuring that “no candidate participating in our presidential nominating process gains any unfair advantage — real or perceived — during our primary season”. He also said the debate schedule would be decided in advance rather than negotiated after all candidates had entered the race.

Perez also pledged to ensure all joint fundraising agreements would be transparent, including the new Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund agreements developed with the 50 state parties."

A refugee in the Manus Island detention centre standoff collapsed with heart pain on Saturday night and waited more than four hours for Papua New Guinean authorities to take him to hospital.

The man is among 600 refugees and asylum seekers barricaded inside the mothballed detention centre, which closed on Tuesday.

The Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani told Guardian Australia one of his fellow countrymen collapsed at about 7.30pm.

“When he collapsed last night we were without power so everywhere was dark and the refugees became so scared,” he said. “It was a such hard night. Some of the refugees tried to look after him and we tried to help him. We had two phone numbers that immigration had earlier put up in case of emergency. We called those numbers but nobody answered.”

Boochani said the asylum seekers and refugees unsuccessfully tried to call police and the navy.

“Finally we were able to get a message to [International Health and Medical Services] who are working in East Lorengau camp but they said, ‘We cannot help you there while you are refusing to leave the prison camp,” he said.

“After two hours, a car belonging to the police mobile squad appeared and we stopped them and asked them to help. They said there is no ambulance here and you must wait until morning, then make your way to East Loreangau to receive medical treatment.

“Finally PNG immigration sent a car and picked up the sick refugee, after more than four-and-a-half hours since he collapsed.”

Boochani said the refugee was taken to Lorengau hospital half an hour away however they did not have adequate equipment to deal with his condition.

The man had a long history of heart pain and had seen two specialists in Port Moresby in February who had recommended treatment in Australia but that request had been denied.

Dr Barri Phatarfod from Doctors for Refugees expressed concerns about the man’s medical treatment at Lorengau hospital, saying no electrocardiogram heart monitoring or blood tests were carried out.

“It is impossible to adequately assess a potential myocardial infarct in the absence of both of these investigations,” she said. “If this occurred in Australia it would be grossly negligent.”

Six detainees have died on Manus Island – including one who was murdered – since it was reopened in 2012.

The Greens say the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, must be held to account for the standoff on Manus Island. Dutton, however, accused the Greens of stoking tensions on the island.

“The Australian government has stopped deaths at sea,” he said on Sunday. “If we allow people who sought to our country by boat to reside in Australia permanently, that will mean that the people smugglers are back in business.”

Turnbull government ministers continue to proclaim there is no need for any citizenship audit of the parliament, despite lingering questions over the eligibility of MPs that risk seeing the constitutional crisis drag into the new year.



Despite Coalition MPs such as Kevin Andrews, Craig Kelly and Eric Abetz publicly calling for some sort of citizenship audit to settle the matter, senior government ministers were sent out on Sunday to hold the line against one.

“We have the principles of the procedures of fairness, natural justice and also the presumption of innocence,” Mathias Cormann told Sky. “We don’t want to get ourselves in a situation where we’ve got this witch-hunt type, lynch mob-type justice.

“We are a civilised society, we are a parliamentary democracy, we have constitutional arrangements which underpin the stability of our system of government and we have to preserve that – and that means that members of parliament shouldn’t be put in the position that they are assumed to be in breach unless they can prove they are not.”

Speaking to the ABC, Kelly O’Dwyer also picked up on the “witch hunt” talking point.

“No witch hunt, no Salem witch trial will actually take away from the fact that the high court is the only arbitrator on this question, so we need to take a pretty deep breath, because those people who said they’re not compliant have, in fact, come forward,” O’Dwyer.

“And the high court has made a determination and it is clear. And anyone who feels that they are not compliant needs to come forward and seek that referral. And anyone who doesn’t asserts that they are currently compliant with the constitution.”

But Kelly went further, denying that all the MPs who had been referred to the high court had done so only after questions were raised by citizens and the media.

“Every single person who has come before the high court has actually come forward,” she said. “So it’s actually not true at all to say that they have been outed. They, themselves, have come forward and said, ‘We don’t believe that we’re compliant with the constitution, with section 44.’”

Scott Ludlam resigned after a lawyer questioned his dual-citizenship status, which caused Larissa Waters to investigate her own status and subsequently resign.

Barnaby Joyce spent weeks denying any dual-citizenship concerns, and joked about it on some occasions, before media inquiries prompted his own referral, which then led to Fiona Nash making her own individual inquiries regarding her status.

Malcolm Roberts spent weeks denying he was a citizen of any other nation, telling media he was “choosing to believe” he was only ever Australian, before being eventually forced to refer himself to the high court, after Greens senators indicated they were willing to break convention and make the referral for him.

Roberts continued to deny he had any issues until after the high court ruling.

Alex Hawke is the latest Turnbull MP to be dragged into the fray, with News Corp reporting concerns the Mitchell MP may be a citizen by descent of Greece, through his mother.

“I am an Australian citizen only and have never held or acquired or sought Greek or any other citizenship,” he told News Corp.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull returned to Australian on Friday to find the heritage of his energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, under the microscope, following a 2011 decision by Hungary to attempt to right a World War II wrong, reinstating the right to citizenship on citizens who were stripped of their status under the fascist, German-allied government of the 1940s.

Frydenberg’s mother, Erica, was one of those citizens.

But despite an internal check on the eligibility of MPs by party executives – which began after Parry’s late admission of a citizenship conflict reinvigorated the issue many had thought was finally settling down following October’s high court ruling – the government officially stands against any sort of public audit.

On Friday, Labor said it would support a universal disclosure of eligibility documents, provided there was bipartisan support.

That came after the president of the Senate, Stephen Parry, came forward with his own dual-citizen concerns, later confirmed, which led to his own resignation.

It later emerged, first reported by the ABC, that Parry had confided his concerns in senior ministers in the lead-up to the high court ruling but had been counselled to remain quiet until after the judgment, with the government then confident its advice from the solicitor general would see its members returned to the parliament.

Mitch Fifield later admitted he had known of Parry’s concerns ahead of his announcement. Turnbull was not alerted until the day Parry’s announcement became public.

Under parliamentary rules, any MP can move a motion to refer another member to the high court, provided the motion receives majority support, however under convention, the member in question, or at the very least their party, are usually encouraged to make the move themselves. Historically, this precedent is yet to be broken."

Peter Dutton has brushed off an attack by a Greens MP that labelled him “a terrorist”, saying “it says more about Mr Adam Bandt and the Greens than it does about me”.

Bandt, a federal Greens MP, told a Melbourne rally of asylum seeker supporters on Saturday that the immigration minister was inflicting terror for political gain.

“What is happening between Canberra and Manus has ceased to be government and has become terror,” Bandt said. “If the definition of terror is to use violence and threaten people’s lives for political purposes, then Peter Dutton is a terrorist.”

Bandt said the immigration minister must be held to account for the standoff on Manus Island, where 600 asylum seekers and refugees are refusing to leave the former detention centre. Dutton, however, accused the Greens of stoking tensions on the island.

“I think that says more about Mr Adam Bandt and the Greens than it does about me,” he said of Bandt’s comments. “The Australian government has stopped deaths at sea. We’ve got every child out of detention. Adam Bandt, when he was in government with Julia Gillard, presided over 1,200 people drowning at sea.

“If we allow people who sought to our country by boat to reside in Australia permanently, that will mean that the people smugglers are back in business.”

Dutton has accused the Greens of using the remaining asylum seekers on Manus Island for their own political ends.

“It’s quite distressing to see the Greens ramping up the tempo on Manus Island because I don’t want to see any incident there,” he told ABC radio. “It’s clear the Greens do.”

As the Manus Island standoff enters its sixth day, pressure is mounting on the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to accept a long-standing New Zealand offer to resettle 150 refugees.

The prime minister is having his first sit down with New Zealand’s newly elected leader Jacinda Ardern in Sydney on Sunday.

About 600 asylum seekers without food and water have pleaded for Australians to come to their aid. The men have barricaded themselves in the mothballed detention centre, which closed on Tuesday.

The group is too scared to move to alternative accommodation in the main township out of fear they will be attacked by locals. The last food packs were distributed last Sunday and the group has been digging holes to find water.

The United Nations human rights office has called on Australia to restore food, water and health services to the group on Manus Island.

Ardern has reiterated the NZ offer, first made under John Key’s government to the Gillard government in 2013 and rejected many times since.

The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the plan had similarities to the US resettlement deal to take 1,250 people.

“[The prime minister] should have the conversation and see if we can make this proposal work,” Shorten said. “If it’s not a viable option, then Turnbull should explain why. Doing nothing is not an option.”

Turnbull has previously stated it would be a marketing opportunity for people smugglers.

On Saturday hundreds of concerned supporters gathered at rallies in Melbourne and Sydney to call for an end to the standoff.

Two men who remain inside the closed detention centre have pleaded with Australians to help them.

“We are forgotten people who have been tortured ... even though we have committed no crime,” one man said in a recorded message played at a rally on Saturday.

The other man said: “Our situation is getting worse and we need your help ... Will Australians stand up and speak for humanity if you think refugees are humans?”

Federal Labor says Turnbull must also ask the US president, Donald Trump, to speed up the resettling of refugees in the US.



“Turnbull is meeting with President Trump in coming weeks, in Asia, he should raise again the possibility of taking some people,” Shorten said. “There is something going on at Manus which is deeply disturbing to the Australian people.”

Dutton said this week that the three alternative locations for the detainees were much better facilities that the closed centre, despite claims at least one of the sites is still under construction.

“The advocates who are here telling them not to move, they are not doing those people any favours,” he told the Nine Network on Thursday.

For a moment in court, the mask slipped. Paul Manafort glanced at his lawyer and smirked, like a TV mafia boss with reasons to be confident. It was the look of a man who, after decades of work as a lobbyist for murderous dictators in Africa and Asia, was not about to be rattled by the prospect of house arrest.

But less than a mile away, another man displayed rather less equanimity. Donald Trump woke before dawn on Monday and, instead of heading to the Oval Office, lingered in the White House residence. “Trump clicked on the television and spent the morning playing fuming media critic, legal analyst and crisis communications strategist, according to several people close to him,” the Washington Post reported.

Quick Guide What you need to know about the Trump-Russia inquiry Show Hide How serious are the allegations? The story of Donald Trump and Russia comes down to this: a sitting president or his campaign is suspected of having coordinated with a foreign country to manipulate a US election. The story could not be bigger, and the stakes for Trump – and the country – could not be higher. What are the key questions? Investigators are asking two basic questions: did Trump’s presidential campaign collude at any level with Russian operatives to sway the 2016 US presidential election? And did Trump or others break the law to throw investigators off the trail? What does the country think? While a majority of the American public now believes that Russia tried to disrupt the US election, opinions about Trump campaign involvement tend to split along partisan lines: 73% of Republicans, but only 13% of Democrats, believe Trump did “nothing wrong” in his dealings with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. What are the implications for Trump? The affair has the potential to eject Trump from office. Experienced legal observers believe that prosecutors are investigating whether Trump committed an obstruction of justice. Both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton – the only presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the last century – were accused of obstruction of justice. But Trump’s fate is probably up to the voters. Even if strong evidence of wrongdoing by him or his cohort emerged, a Republican congressional majority would probably block any action to remove him from office. (Such an action would be a historical rarity.) What has happened so far? Former foreign policy adviser George Papadopolous pleaded guilty to perjury over his contacts with Russians linked to the Kremlin, and the president’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide face charges of money laundering. When will the inquiry come to an end? The investigations have an open timeline.

Until that moment, the justice department investigation into his election campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia had seemed somewhat theoretical, dismissable by Trump as a “hoax” and “witch hunt”. But here was the concrete of the courthouse, the accused escorted in by marshals, standing before a robed judge, swearing on oath and pleading for liberty. Suddenly Trump understood the five-month investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller – probing whether the American president has been compromised by a foreign power – had entered a new and dangerous phase.

“Overall this week what we learned is that Bob Mueller knows a lot more about what happened during the presidential campaign than anyone on the outside thought he did,” said Matthew Miller, a partner at strategic advisory firm Vianovo and former director of public affairs at the justice department. “We have an incomplete picture and we don’t know what the final picture might look like.”

Manafort, who served Trump’s campaign for five months – as its chairman, and his business associate Rick Gates, who also played a role in the campaign, were indicted on 12 counts including conspiracy against the US, conspiracy to launder money, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, making false statements and failing to report foreign bank and financial accounts.

There was a silver lining for the president: the indictment did not reference the Trump campaign or coordination with Russia. But it did allege a criminal conspiracy was continuing into February this year, after Trump had taken office, and that the pair funneled payments through foreign companies and bank accounts as part of their work for Ukraine’s pro-Russia former president Viktor Yanukovych.

Bob Mueller knows a lot more about what happened in the presidential campaign than anyone on the outside thought he did Matthew Miller

Frank Figliuzzi, former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, told MSNBC: “If you look at this through a counterintelligence lens, you see the fingerprints of the Russian government here ... He [Manafort] got a primer on how the Russians can influence a campaign when he represented the Ukrainian candidate [Yanukovych] and he saw what Russia could do to influence a campaign. And he liked it.”

Appearing in a tense courtroom on Monday before a packed public gallery, Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty and were released on multimillion dollar bonds but confined to their homes. Lawyers for Manafort – also among the participants of a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-linked lawyer after Donald Trump Jr was promised “dirt” on rival Hillary Clinton – defended him in a court filing on Thursday as a “successful, international political consultant” who was necessarily involved in foreign financial transactions. US district judge Amy Berman Jackson has set a possible date of 7 May for the trial.

Mueller, evidently, is carrying his investigation out in stages, as if taking on an organised crime family. He may delve into Trump’s personal finances too. John Sipher, a national security analyst and former member of the CIA’s national clandestine service, said: “The fact the Mueller investigation would be willing to bring charges on everything from money laundering to tax evasion against Manafort, who was Trump’s campaign chairman, is a big deal and suggests to me there’s a lot more there.”

Trump said on Twitter the alleged crimes were “years ago” and insisted there was “NO COLLUSION” between his associates and Russia. He characteristically sought to shift attention to his Democratic opponent, tweeting: “Why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????”

The Manafort story broke just before 8am on Monday. In normal circumstances, charges against the former campaign chairman of a sitting president would be devastating enough. But then, around 10.30am, came a bolt from the blue. An unsealed indictment revealed that former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials and who were offering “dirt” on Clinton.

The special counsel’s one-two punch was deliberate, Miller believes. “He did the two together to send a very clear message to everyone in the Trump orbit. ‘If you cooperate, you’ll get a very favourable deal’ – I think he probably won’t go to jail – ‘If you lie and obstruct I’m going to throw the book at you and you’re looking at years in jail.”

Alarmingly for the White House, Papadopoulos is now cooperating with Mueller’s investigators and, some speculated, may have worn a wire. The White House predictably sought to distance itself from him. Trump tweeted: “Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.”

But a photo posted on Trump’s Instagram account shows Papadopoulos sitting at a table with the businessman as well as Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general, and other foreign policy advisers in March last year. According to the court documents, Papadopoulos told the meeting “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin”.

A New York Times report on Tuesday quoted a participant as saying that Sessions “shut George down”, ruled there should be no meeting with Putin and ordered those present “not to speak about this again”. CNN also said Carter Page, another former Trump campaign adviser, informed the House intelligence committee on Thursday that he had told Sessions of an upcoming July 2016 trip to Russia.

Yet in his testimony to the Senate judiciary committee in June, the attorney general denied knowing anything about contacts between the campaign and Russians. Now Senate Democrats are calling for him to testify again. Senator Al Franken wrote in a letter to Sessions: “This is another example in an alarming pattern in which you, the nation’s top law enforcement officer, apparently failed to tell the truth, under oath, about the Trump team’s contacts with agents of Russia, a hostile foreign power that interfered in the 2016 election.”

Trump himself - who last week claimed to have “one of the great memories of all time” – was vague on the details of the Papadopoulos meeting. As he set off for a 13-day tour of Asia on Friday, he told reporters: “I don’t remember much about that meeting. It was a very unimportant meeting. It took place a long time ago ... All I can tell you is this: There was no collusion. There was no nothing. It’s a disgrace, frankly, that they continue.”

As is his wont, Trump argued that the justice department should look into Clinton and her campaign’s conduct with the Democratic National Committee during the presidential primary race.

‘Catastrophically bad judgment’

As the first anniversary of Trump’s shock win over Clinton approaches, it is clear the Russia affair will hover over most if not all his presidency. This week, appearing before three congressional committees, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google admitted that their platforms were abused by Russia to inflame existing divisions over issues such as immigration and gun control.

House investigators released a batch of Facebook and Twitter ads – a sample of more than 3,000 turned over to the committee – that demonstrated America’s all-conquering social media had been weaponised against it. One promoted an event to “Support Hillary. Save American Muslims!” with a picture of a woman in a hijab beside Clinton. Another for a group called “Stop AI” urged viewers to “like and share if you want burqa banned in America,” implying that the all-enveloping garment could be hiding a terrorist.

Democrats in particular sought to clip the wings of the tech companies. Senator Franken demanded sardonically: “How did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them into personal connections for its users, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads paid for in rubles were coming from Russia?” Senator Dianne Feinstein told the tech companies: “I don’t think you get it.”

However, there was not conclusive proof that Moscow had conspired on behalf of Trump alone. Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch testified that Russian activity had continued after the election “fomenting discord about the validity” of Trump’s victory.

It’s like hitting a boulder with a hammer 1,000 times and it doesn’t break. The 1,001st time, it smashes John Sipher

Some commentators also suggested that the week’s developments in the Mueller investigation were not as brutal for Trump as they first appeared. Marc Thiessen, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute thinktank and former chief speechwriter for George W Bush, argued that the Papadopoulos case was an example of incompetence rather than malevolence.

“There’s still no more public evidence of criminal collusion with Russia than there was before charges were brought,” Thiessen wrote in the Washington Post. “But there is plenty of evidence that the Trump campaign had catastrophically bad judgment in choosing its most senior and junior advisers – and that Russia’s spy network sought to exploit that weakness.”

What seems certain, however, is that these are merely the first pieces in a sprawling jigsaw puzzle. Until Monday, no one outside the special counsel’s office even knew that Papadopoulos was a piece in that puzzle. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn is expected to come under Mueller’s scrutiny over his associations with Moscow.

Miller said: “The biggest question in American politics is whether Flynn is cooperating with Bob Mueller or not. My guess is that he’s either cooperating or trying to get a pardon from Trump – which is a very dangerous thing.”

Is the Russia investigation, probably the most important ever conducted by the justice department, closer to bringing down the Trump presidency than it was a week ago? Sipher noted that his demise has been widely predicted before yet somehow he manages to survive – until the day he doesn’t.

“It’s like hitting a boulder with a hammer 1,000 times and it doesn’t break,” he said. “Then you hit it the 1,001st time and it smashes to pieces. Its hard to predict.”"

The US special forces detachment ambushed in the Niger last month fought alone for hours after the local Nigerien forces they were accompanying fled in the first minutes of the engagement, retired and serving special forces officers with knowledge of events have said.

The trapped soldiers also made repeated efforts to convince French warplanes sent from neighbouring Mali to engage the enemy, attempting to “talk in” the pilots who refused to attack due to poor weather, rough terrain and an inability to differentiate friend from foe, the officers said.

Four US Green Berets and five Nigerien troops died in the incident, which has been the focus of an intense debate in Washington over the executive branch’s extensive powers to use military force abroad without congressional approval and with little oversight.

The Niger incident has been described as an “intelligence failure” by the Republican senator John McCain, who blamed it on budget cuts.

The US troops were part of a “train and equip” programme, but the incident has prompted questions in Congress on where such missions blur into counter-terrorist combat.



Controversy flared after Trump was accused of mishandling a phone call to the widow of La David Johnson, one of the dead soldiers.

Timeline How the controversy over Trump's condolence call unfolded Show Hide

Soldiers killed in Niger Four US army special forces troops and five soldiers from Niger die in an ambush during a joint patrol in the south-west of the country. The row begins Asked why he has not spoken about the incident, Trump discusses his calls to bereaved families, saying: “If you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls – a lot of them didn’t make calls.” Trump drags White House chief of staff John Kelly into the developing row, saying: “You could ask Gen Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?”, a reference to the death of Kelly's son in Afghanistan. Trump phones the widow of Sgt La David Johnson and reportedly says Johnson “knew what he was signing up for”, according to Frederica Wilson, a Democratic congresswomen who heard the call. Wilson criticizes Trump's reported remark as ""so insensitive"". In response, Trump claims Wilson's account is “totally fabricated” but Johnson's mother supports Wilson's version of events. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Kelly is “disgusted and frustrated” by the politicization of his son's death – even though it was Trump who first mentioned him. Enter John Kelly Kelly delivers a rebuke to critics of Trump in an emotional press conference but fails to acknowledge that the controversy began after Trump attacked Obama. Sanders says it would be “highly inappropriate” to question Kelly, a four-star general, a comment that causes outcry in itself. On the day of Sgt Johnson’s funeral, Trump refuses to let the matter rest, referring to Wilson as ""Wacky Congresswoman Wilson"" in a tweet. Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt Johnson, says Trump's condolence call ""made me cry even worse"". Trump disputes her account immediately after the interview aires.



The Pentagon has launched a special investigation to be carried out by officers from US Africa Command, which is due to report within two months. A defence department spokesman said that there would be no further comment on the incident until then. But defence department leaks have fuelled anger within the US special forces community at what one retired senior officer called “a massive blame game”.

“To them, it is obviously the [soldiers’ own] fault and error on a ‘routine’ training and advisory mission in Niger,” he wrote in an email to other members of the community, seen by the Guardian.

US special forces deaths in Niger lift veil on shadow war against Islamists in Sahel Read more

The email contains new details of the engagement, which took place on the immediate outskirts of the remote village of Tongo Tongo in south-western Niger, in the centre of the volatile Sahel region.

The Pentagon has said the unit that was attacked comprised 12 soldiers from the 3rd Special Forces Group which had recently arrived in Niger for a six-month tour, and about 30 Nigerien troops.

The ambush took place at 11:40pm on 4 October after the unit had spent two hours in Tongo Tongo, talking to local elders. The previous night, the Americans had destroyed a camp used by Djoundjoun Cheiffou, a lieutenant of Abu Waleed al-Sahraoui, an Islamic extremist based in neighbouring Mali who last year pledged allegiance to Islamic State.

Local media in Niger revealed this week that Cheffou was in detention there until 2016 when he was freed in return for the release of an Australian hostage, Jocelyn Elliott.

About 50 men attacked the US and Nigerien unit with small arms, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars.

The retired special forces officer said he had been told by servicemen with detailed knowledge of the incident that “approximately half of the US/Nigerien force was allowed to pass through the ambush killzone before the ambush was sprung, trapping the rear half.”

On hearing firing, the lead group of soldiers turned around to engage the militants.

“Except for those already dead or wounded, all of the Nigerien soldiers bugged out and left the Americans to fight … all by themselves. Two groups, roughly six Americans per group, fighting for their lives alone against a superior ALQ force,” the retired officer said.

A US drone was on the site of the engagement within minutes, but was unarmed. An hour passed before the trapped unit on the ground called for airstrikes against the militants who surrounded them. The delay has surprised and concerned experts and veterans.

“Airstrikes were requested as the Americans fought on. Several French Mirage fighters responded, but refused to engage citing poor weather, rough terrain and an inability to differentiate friend from foe. American SF [Special Forces] requested ‘danger close’ support and attempted to talk the CAS [close air support] in, but the French Mirages alleged continued to refuse to engage,” the officer wrote in the mail, based on his own discussions with serving and retired special forces soldiers with knowledge of the incident.

A spokesman for the French defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations.

According to a CNN account of the incident, the attackers set fire to the dry bush around the encircled special forces soldiers to cover the battleground with smoke. The account quoted a Nigerien soldier as saying that the surviving troops from the patrol were fighting off their attackers, standing back to back in a last stand, when reinforcements finally arrived.

After two hours, French special forces flown by helicopter from their base in Mali reached the site of the ambush, prompting the attackers to withdraw. The French soldiers searched the immediate vicinity and evacuated survivors, including several who were wounded.

Four US special forces soldiers were left behind. Three are thought to have been dead at the site. It is unclear when Johnson was killed, but the 25-year-old mechanic had become separated from the rest of the unit almost immediately after the ambush started, sources within the special forces community said.

The Pentagon has now said that a second team of US and Nigerien forces was close to the ambushed patrol. It was believed to have been on a mission to kill or capture al-Sahraoui. That operation was called off, and the troops eventually retrieved the bodies of three of the US soldiers several hours after the ambush had ended.

Johnson’s remains were discovered by Nigerien troops near the site of the attack two days later.

The five Nigeriens killed in the ambush died in its first moments, sources within the special forces community said.

They described how one of the light, unarmoured trucks used by the patrol became stuck in sand after the attack started. Almost all the Nigerien troops it was carrying were killed or wounded. One source said the vehicle was hit by a mortar round.

Most of the ambushed US unit had no combat experience, and had not been warned to expect any encounter with hostile forces.

This assessment has surprised some and has been a focus of congressional attention. A United Nations assessment indicated that there have been at least 46 attacks by armed groups in the districts around Tongo Tongo since February 2016.

The cabinet heavyweight’s shock departure on Wednesday followed a phone call from the journalist, Jane Merrick, who informed Downing Street that he had lunged at her and attempted to kiss her on the lips in 2003 after they had lunched together.

The revelation was the tipping point for No 10, which the Observer understands had been compiling a list of alleged incidents involving Fallon since claims against him were first made.

After Fallon’s attempt to kiss her, Merrick, then a 29-year-old junior political reporter at the Daily Mail, said she “shrank away in horror and ran off to my office in the Press Gallery”. Writing in the Observer, she said: “I felt humiliated, ashamed. Was I even guilty that maybe I had led him on in some way by drinking with him? After years of having a drink with so many other MPs who have not acted inappropriately towards me, I now know I was not.”

A friend of Fallon confirmed the incident took place. “Michael realises this kind of incident was unacceptable which is why he had to resign,” they said.

Merrick said she decided to contact Downing Street after becoming aware of other, more recent allegations against Fallon. She has written about the incident before, choosing not to identify Fallon, but his behaviour after further allegations last week convinced her to name him. She writes that Fallon “has denied some allegations, and minimised others as somehow acceptable because they date from another time. His lack of contrition has made me change my mind.”

On Tuesday, the Sun revealed that Fallon had admitted to repeatedly touching the journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer’s knee at a conference dinner 15 years ago.

Merrick writes: “The impression was being left that this was a one-off incident that could now be laughed off. I knew that by failing to act I was letting down not only my 29-year-old self, but also any other women who may have been subjected to the same behaviour since. More importantly, I would be failing to protect other women in future.”

On Thursday evening, it emerged that the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, had informed Downing Street earlier in the week about lewd remarks Fallon had made to her, a claim he denied.

Merrick writes: “Once again, some were dismissing the remarks as trivial, the sort of banter that goes on in workplaces across the country. By continuing to stay silent now, I was still running away from Fallon, just as I ran away from him in 2003. I decided it was time to come forward and name him. I want him to know that, however long ago this incident was, his behaviour was unacceptable.”

Her approach to No 10 triggered a swift reaction. “At 5pm on Wednesday afternoon, I contacted Downing Street to report the 2003 incident to one of the prime minister’s aides,” Merrick writes. “By 7.30pm, Fallon had resigned, admitting his behaviour towards women in the past had ‘fallen short’ of the high standards of the Armed Forces.”

Messages left seeking comment from Fallon went unreturned. However, he told the Times on Saturday: “I’ve already accepted that I have behaved inappropriately in the past.”

Merrick’s account offers a corrective to the suggestion that Fallon was forced out because of his alleged comments to Leadsom. Rather, it seems a pattern of allegedly unacceptable behaviour over the course of many years was the real reason for his spectacular fall. Leadsom told No 10 and the whips’ office about Fallon’s alleged comments early last week. However, the Observer understands she insisted on anonymity and did not want to make a formal complaint. When her allegations leaked, fingers were pointed at the former chief whip, Gavin Williamson, who replaced Fallon. Williamson’s office has denied that he had any role in the leak.

Theresa May can ill afford suggestions of a power struggle between the leader of the house and the defence secretary as the drip-feed of allegations threatens to engulf the government while it is supposed to be focused on Brexit. The toxic claims, which include an allegation that May’s closest ally, Damian Green, behaved inappropriately with a female journalist, a claim he denies, have dismayed many of the Tory old guard who fear what it could do to the party.

Tory MP Sir Roger Gale on Saturday warned of a witch-hunt as accusations of sexual harassment continue to swirl. He said MPs and others were on a “hiding to nothing” as it was difficult to refute claims from years ago. His comments were swiftly rejected by Labour MP Harriet Harman, who told the BBC: “No, it’s not a witch-hunt; it’s long overdue.”

Gale was speaking after the Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said he was unaware of the nature of “serious allegations” against him, which the Tory party says it has passed to police. The chief whip, Julian Smith, has confirmed that Elphicke has been suspended but would not elaborate further. The Dover and Deal MP has denied any wrongdoing and complained that the media had been told of his suspension before he had.

Meanwhile, a string of Labour MPs have had to respond to accusations: Clive Lewis denied a claim that he groped a woman at conference in September; former Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis rejected claims he had made non-consensual sexual advances towards women; Kelvin Hopkins “categorically” denied allegations of inappropriate conduct made by activist Ava Etemadzadeh.

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for party leaders to agree new procedures when they meet later this week. “We have had sexual harassment across all the political parties by the looks of it. So we have got to tackle it,” he said.

And Scottish childcare minister Mark McDonald resigned on Saturday after allegations regarding his private life. The MSP for Aberdeen Donside apologised “unreservedly to anyone I have upset or who might have found my behaviour inappropriate”.

Lord Bew, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said outside bodies needed to be involved in investigating the allegations. “It is vital there are people outside parliament who can give some reassurance to the public that this is not just another cover-up,” he said."

Saudi Arabia arrested 11 princes, including a prominent billionaire, and dozens of current and former ministers, reports said, in a sweeping crackdown as the kingdom’s young crown prince consolidates power.

Saudi King Salman appointed two new ministers on Saturday to key security and economic posts, removing one of the royal family’s most prominent members as head of the national guard, as part of a series of high-profile sackings that sent shock waves in the kingdom.



The king also announced the creation of a new anti-corruption committee chaired by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman which Al Arabiya TV said had already detained 11 princes, four current ministers and tens of former ministers. The suspects were not named.

The state-run Saudi press agency said the commission’s goal was to “preserve public money, punish corrupt people and those who exploit their positions”.

Saudi billionaire Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal was among those arrested, Saudi news websites said, though there was no official confirmation.

An aviation source said security forces had grounded private jets in Jeddah, possibly to prevent any high-profile figures from leaving.

The kingdom’s top council of clerics tweeted that anti-corruption efforts were “as important as the fight against terrorism”, essentially giving religious backing to the crackdown.

“The breadth and scale of the arrests appears to be unprecedented in modern Saudi history,” said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in the US.

“The reported detention of Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, if true, would send shock waves through the domestic and international business community.” .

The cabinet reshuffle saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah replaced as minister of the national guard by Khaled bin Ayyaf, while economy minister Adel Fakieh was removed in favour of his deputy Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, according to a royal decree carried by state-run media.

Prince Miteb, the preferred son of the late King Abdullah, was once thought to be a leading contender for the throne before the unexpected rise of Prince Mohammed two years ago.

He had inherited control of the national guard, an elite internal security force built out of traditional tribal units, from his father, who ran it for five decades.

Prince Miteb was the last remaining member of Abdullah’s branch of the family to hold a position in the upper echelons of the Saudi power structure.

The move consolidates Prince Mohammed’s control of the kingdom’s security institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Bin Salman, the king’s 32-year-old son, already serves as defence minister and was named heir to the throne in a June reshuffle that sidelined his older cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef who had also served as interior minister.

He has been responsible at the same time for running Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, dictating an energy policy with global implications and behind the plans for the kingdom to build a future after oil.

The prince, who has pledged to go after graft at the highest levels, will now also lead the new anti-corruption body, which was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and freeze assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

The country’s new economy minister, Tuwaijri, is a former Saudi air force pilot and former chief executive of HSBC’s Middle East operations who has led the economy ministry’s programme to privatise $200 billion of government assets.

He replaces Fakieh, who served as the point man for the kingdom’s wide-ranging economic reforms since his appointment as economy and planning minister in 2015.

Fakieh faced down fierce opposition from the business community as labour minister when he established quotas for foreign workers to boost jobs for Saudis.

His replacement comes as the kingdom makes adjustments to that plan, a process dubbed NTP 2.0.

The royal decree did not say whether Fakieh would hold any other government position. Former ministers often serve in advisory roles after leaving their posts.

A US soldier was killed on Saturday after sustaining injuries on an operation in Logar in the eastern part of the country, the US military said.

The airstrikes in Kunduz on Friday night targeted three villages in Chardara, a district west of the provincial capital where Taliban fighters have long maintained a strong presence.

Afghan security forces prevented access to the bomb sites in Essa Khil, Qatl-e Aam and Uzbek Bazaar, barring relatives from picking up bodies and hindering a precise assessment of the toll. Afghan forces claimed no civilians had been killed in the strikes.

A provincial council member, Khosh Mohammad Nasratyar, estimated that around 55 civilians had been killed while an Afghan aid worker in the area, who asked not to be named, said at least 40 had been killed, including multiple women and children. The New York Times, citing residents and officials in the area, said at least 13 were dead.

An Afghan security official, who also asked not to be named, said the Taliban had forced locals to carry bodies of insurgents killed the night before, just as the bombers struck.

A spokesman for the US military in Afghanistan, Capt Tom Gresback, said US forces were looking into the allegations of civilian casualties but declined to say more about the operation, which he said was “ongoing”.

American and Afghan forces had been carrying out operations in the area for several days, but residents said aerial attacks intensified on Friday night with jets, bombers and drones crossing the sky incessantly.

Residents said the bombings shook windows in the provincial capital and seemed worse than similar strikes in 2015, when coalition and Afghan forces battled the Taliban for two weeks inside the city.

US airstrikes have surged dramatically since Donald Trump announced his Afghanistan strategy. More than 900 munitions were released in August and September, bringing this year’s total to nearly 3,000, more than twice the expended munitions last year.

The growing air campaign is a result of greater autonomy bestowed by Trump on his generals, and a possible sign of the direction of US involvement in Afghanistan. The CIA is reportedly seeking authority to conduct its own drone strikes in Afghanistan, a first if approved, according to the New York Times.

Kunduz has long been one of the most tormented Afghan provinces, especially since 2015 when the Taliban captured and held the provincial capital. During the fight to retake the city, Afghan special forces called in a US airstrike which hit a hospital run by Médecins Sans Frontières, killing 42 people in one of the most spectacular mistakes of the war.

The Taliban stormed the city again last year, albeit briefly, but fighting persisted. A month later, another US airstrike killed 33 civilians.

The deadliest errant strike in Kunduz occurred in 2009, when an American war plane responded to a call from German forces and struck two fuel tankers captured by Taliban, killing more than 90 civilians who had gathered to siphon petrol from the trucks.

In a separate incident on Saturday, a US soldier succumbed to wounds sustained on an operation in the eastern province of Logar, where another US airstrike in August killed 11 civilians.

Gen John Nicholson, the top US commander in the country, offered “our deepest condolences to the family of our fallen brother”.

The soldier, whose identity has yet to be publicised, was the 15th coalition soldier killed in 2017, of whom 13 have been Americans."
"Carole Cadwalladr, Michael Savage",Foreign secretary among three ministers targeted by people linked to FBI investigation into Donald Trump’s alleged collusion with Moscow,2017-11-05T01:20:01Z,the-guardian-uk,Boris Johnson in spotlight as questions raised over Russian influence on UK,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/04/boris-johnson-brexit-russia-trump,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18290cf09d25bdf457b1f7841d0177a135517070/0_141_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=10631a17fd8ccc677069c644cc5addda,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Three senior past and present Foreign Office ministers, including the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, were targeted by individuals identified by the FBI last week as central to their investigation into Trump-Russia collusion, the Observer has learned.

Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour party, called the revelations “extraordinary” and said the government must say whether other ministers were targeted or had meetings. The reports from the US had shocked MPs, he said, and it was vital to know if the Russian state had also sought to influence British politics.

The Observer has learned of meetings and encounters between British ministers and two individuals named in FBI indictments unsealed last week – George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser for Donald Trump’s campaign, and a “London professor” with high-level connections to the Russian state, subsequently identified as a Maltese academic, Joseph Mifsud.

Alok Sharma, a Foreign Office minister until June year and MP for Reading West, confirmed he had met Mifsud “a couple of times” and he had attended a fundraising dinner in his constituency on 19 October this year, where he had “briefly greeted” him.

An email from Mifsud to a colleague, seen by the Observer and uncovered by Byline, the crowdfunded independent journalism site, revealed Mifsud had told a colleague he would be “meeting Boris Johnson for dinner re Brexit” on that date. Sharma confirmed Johnson was the guest speaker at the event.

A Foreign Office source said: “The foreign secretary has not knowingly met this person, planned to meet this person, or indeed ever heard of this person before.”

Sharma said: “I did not introduce him to Boris Johnson and I don’t think anyone else did either.” But indications of Russian efforts to make contacts with British officials could prove embarrassing for Johnson, who was asked about possible foreign interference in Britain last week and replied: “I haven’t seen a sausage.”

The revelation comes as the Observer investigation into foreign influence places him in a web of relationships between a known Russian spy, Sergey Nalobin, expelled from Britain in 2015, and Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Vote Leave, the official Leave campaign headed by Johnson.

Watson said: “We’re starting to have a much clearer picture from America of how the Russian state sought to influence the US election and I think there are multiple questions to be asked about how and in what ways the Russian state may have been exerting influence in British politics. Given the gravity of the allegations against Mr Papadopoulos, the government should make public any meetings these two individuals had with British officials and what was discussed.”

Even more questions are raised by a meeting the Observer has discovered between Papadopoulos and Tobias Ellwood, then a senior minister in the Foreign Office, at the UN general assembly in September 2016.

This was when Papadopoulos was still working for the Trump campaign and, according to the FBI’s documents, had made multiple contacts through his intermediary – the “London professor” – with “high-level Russian officials”. Ellwood’s meeting occurred after Papadopoulos had discovered in April that the Russians had “dirt on Hillary [Clinton]” in the form of “thousands of emails” but before WikiLeaks started publishing her emails in October.

Ben Bradshaw, the MP who has been one of the few voices asking questions about possible Russian interference in British democracy, said the Foreign Office’s explanation that such a meeting was “routine” was implausible. “In my experience, it is not normal for a minister to meet party campaign operatives while on official government business.” He added: “If Mr Papadopoulos’s role was as junior as Trump has been claiming, I would be surprised that a minister as senior and experienced as Mr Ellwood would agree to meet him.”

Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat spokesman for Brexit, said it was time to launch a formal inquiry. “With concerns emerging about possible Russian interference here in the EU referendum, the [Commons] intelligence and security committee needs to be reconstituted as a matter of urgency.”

“Their first inquiry should focus on possible Russian meddling in the EU referendum. People need to know if Russian roubles played any part in securing the small majority for Brexit on 23June 2016.”"
"Emma Graham-Harrison, Daniel Boffey",Deposed president Carles Puigdemont wants secessionist politicians to stand together in December election to create ‘second referendum’,2017-11-04T22:25:01Z,the-guardian-uk,‘For freedom and the republic’: Catalan leader urges independence parties to unite,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/04/catalonia-carles-puigdemont-urge-unity-second-referendum-spain,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a26ced45ff15a7e142bce0d24c4baef18020004/0_204_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=e976744801615cd3f3f100231b0522a2,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"The ousted Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, has called for separatist parties across the political spectrum in Catalonia to form a united front in December’s regional elections, effectively turning the polls into a de facto referendum on his drive for independence.

Tweeting from self-imposed exile in Brussels, the deposed regional president on Saturday launched an online petition yesterday to establish a broad secessionist coalition, the day after Spain issued an international warrant for his arrest.

“It is the moment for all democrats to unite. For Catalonia, for the freedom of political prisoners, and for the republic,” he said, adding that the elections offered voters a decisive choice “between democracy and imposition”. By midday there were more than 30,000 signatures.

A fractious and ideologically diverse coalition of parties triggered the current crisis when they used a slim majority in the regional parliament to plan an illegal referendum on breaking away from Spain and then unilaterally declaring independence last month. If they can unite again and win back that majority in next month’s vote, it would be a huge setback for Madrid’s efforts to defuse the biggest constitutional challenge Spain has faced in nearly four decades.

The central government voted to suspend self-rule and take back control of Catalonia just minutes after the fleeting republic was declared in Barcelona on 27 October. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, then set a new round of regional elections for the earliest legally possible date, 21 December.

It looked like an astute political move, allowing the central government to deflect accusations it was trampling on Catalan democracy, while sowing division among pro-independence parties. With a registration deadline of 7 Novemberthis Tuesday, they were immediately thrust into bitter disputes about whether they should take part in the election or not. Hardliners insisted that running candidates meant implicitly accepting Madrid’s authority and acknowledging that the Catalan republic had been stillborn. Moderates argued that sitting out the election meant losing both political authority and the government funds that are vital to their fight for a separate state.

But now all major parties have said they will take part, and there is a real chance that Rajoy could face another separatist parliament at Christmas. The latest polls suggest pro-independence parties could control the legislature again, if they are once more willing to put their battles with Madrid ahead of all other political priorities. The last separatist coalition brought together groups ranging from Puigdemont’s own centre-right party to the radical left CUP (Popular Unity Candidacy). The central government’s handling of the crisis has angered many in Catalonia, even those who do not support independence, and could bolster support for pro-independence parties.

A particular flashpoint has been the arrest and jailing of separatist leaders, including several members of Puigdemont’s cabinet. They could face charges for crimes including rebellion, sedition and embezzlement for their part in pushing for secession. The jailed politicians, who have mostly been denied bail ahead of trial on the grounds they are a flight risk, say their cases are political persecution. The ousted vice-president, Oriol Junqueras, shared a defiant message from his prison cell via Twitter: “We are never going to renounce freedom, even if the price is prison”. A lawyer for the prisoners went public with complaints of “humiliating” treatment, including strip searches.

Their imprisonment has prompted unease abroad, including among allies who have been broadly supportive of the Spanish government and critical of the Catalan independence movement. The Nobel peace prize winner and international negotiator Martti Ahtisaari is among those concerned. He condemned the separatists’ independence bid as a “stupid gamble” that had “caused problems for a lot of others”, but said Spain’s response was too aggressive. “Now there will be an election, and all of the members of Catalonia’s government that now have left the area have to be given the opportunity to take part [in the election] as a candidate,” he told the EU Observer website.

Puigdemont suggested he planned to take part from Brussels, telling a local TV channel: “I can run a campaign from anywhere in the world, as we are in living in a globalised world.” He had already signalled his intention to stay in Brussels as long as possible, retaining a defence lawyer and saying he believed the Spanish courts were politicised, although he has ruled out claiming political asylum.

Puigdemont also made a hollow-sounding promise that he would not seek to cause the Belgian prime minister further problems. “I will be careful about Belgian politics. I am not here to mix with Belgian politics nor to Belgianise Catalan politics,” he said.

The justice minister moved fast to distance the Belgian administration from the Catalan leader’s fate. Unlike other international extradition processes, the European arrest warrant (EAW) lies entirely in the hands of the courts, Koen Geens said. “The executive power does not play any role in the EAW procedure. Everything goes through direct contact between the justice authorities,” the Associated Press quoted him as saying.

Yet for all that the Belgian government has sought to depoliticise the issue, and insist that it is a matter for the independent judiciary, Puigdemont’s arrival has already stirred up domestic political tensions.

The prime minister, Charles Michel, was forced to reprimand his Flemish nationalist minister of migration and asylum, Theo Francken, after he suggested that it was not “unrealistic” to think that Puigdemont could be given political asylum in Belgium. Other MPs attacked him for undermining the country. “Mr Francken created the impression that he was in collusion,” said Olivier Maingain, the president of the francophone liberal party, DéFI, who added: “This will weaken the European role of Belgium.”"

Now it’s time to encourage others to come forward, she says

Television writer Kay Mellor, the powerhouse creator of hit shows from Band of Gold to the new Love, Lies and Records, has spoken out for the first time about her sexual assault at the hands of a senior TV executive earlier in her career.

Mellor was in her 30s and working as a producer at Granada when the unnamed executive, who is now dead, expressed an interest in developing one of her scripts, a comedy drama called Annie’s Back about a mother who moves in with her adult daughters.

“I got a call from his secretary who said he would like to see you and went up in the lift to his office on a floor I’d never been to before,” Mellor told the Observer. “I knocked on the door and he opened it and he said: “Come in.” He was very friendly, a real pillar of the community type and at first everything was fine. He was very positive about the project and said all the right things about how much it made him laugh and what a great premise it was but then the atmosphere started to change.

“He asked if I wanted a drink. I said no I’ve got a script conference to get back down for. He insisted that I sat on the sofa and then turned the conversation back to the script. To be honest I thought he was going to say ‘write up the first episode and we’ll see’ but instead he sat down very close to me, which made me uncomfortable and then lunged at me and tried to kiss me. I pulled away and said: ‘I’m sorry this is not what I’m doing here’ and he replied: ‘Oh really – what did you come up here for then? What did think you were doing?’ I was gobsmacked. I kept thinking have I done something wrong here? Then just as I was heading to open the door he said ‘Kay’. I turned around and he’d exposed himself. He stood there looking at me and said: ‘Is this what you want?’ ”

Mellor went back to her office, slammed the door and sat there feeling stunned. “I never mentioned it to another living soul, not even my husband Anthony. The only people who knew were him and me and that’s terrible to think about now – because he was the guilty one so why did I think that I shared the blame? I felt soiled by the experience as though I was a failure for having even gone up there thinking that it was about getting a commission.”

She decided to move on from Granada. “I probably would have left anyway because I wanted to write but the underlying reason was that I never wanted to see his face again,” she said. “I left the company two and a half weeks after the incident happened and I shredded the script for Annie’s Back. It felt like a link and I never wanted it to get made.”

Mellor’s experience forms part of a growing wave of female and male voices talking about their experience of sexual harassment and abuse. In addition to the multiple accusations against Harvey Weinstein, last week saw Dustin Hoffman accused of two incidents of sexual harassment, Michael Fallon resign as defence secretary over “inappropriate behaviour” and Scotland Yard announce an investigation into allegations of sexual assault involving actor Kevin Spacey. Netflix also said it will cease working with Spacey on its show House of Cards and is declining to release a film starring him.

The society magazine Tatler issued an “unreserved apology” to the actor Daisy Lewis after a segment stated that she was “loud. Which makes her fun at a party. And in bed. Probably.”

She said on Twitter: “I’m really shocked and upset by this. But thankfully I’m ‘loud’ enough to say it. Does anyone at Tatler read the news?”

Mellor says: “I think there are probably a lot of men in all walks of life and many different professions who are quavering in their boots right now because there is going to be an outpouring of this stuff. This is just the beginning.”

“We need to have a conversation about this and we need to have it loudly. We need to talk about why it’s not OK to use belittling language, to put your hands on people’s knees, to lunge at women, to abuse your position of power in any way. It’s not funny and it’s not a joke.”

She regrets not reporting her experience at the time. “In hindsight I should have said something immediately but I just felt so insulted by him. I had written five stage plays, I had two children, I was a grownup with a responsible job and he managed to make me feel sullied and demeaned and as though this was something I should never speak about.”

Despite that, she has no wish to name her attacker. “Had he still been alive I would have named him because I would have liked to look him in the eye and said why did you do that to me? But naming him once he’s dead does nobody any good. What happened could have put me off working in this industry for life but it didn’t. Instead I worked myself into a powerful position so that I could own my own company and champion new young writers, particularly young female writers. I worked myself into a position where that could never happen to me again.”

Mellor hopes that talking openly will encourage other women to come forward. “My biggest hope is that if any woman or man is in the position that I was in,reading this or knowing that other person has come out and spoken about their experience might enable them to speak out themselves and that in turn might stop the next person from being attacked, or make the next man think twice before doing something like this. Hopefully there will be a ripple effect and the effects of that ripple will be felt for some time.”"

The real living wage (RLW), which is promoted by the Living Wage Foundation and is voluntarily paid by more than 3,500 UK employers, is based on what people need to live a decent and healthy lifestyle as determined by a panel of experts. It is currently £8.45 across the UK and £9.75 in London. It differs from the government’s national living wage, which is £7.50 an hour for those 25 or older.

A poll carried out for the Living Wage Foundation also found that more than a third of people earning less than this had topped up their monthly income with a credit card or loan in the last year, while more than one in five reported using a payday loan to cover essentials. More than half – 55% – had declined a social invitation due to lack of money, and just over half had borrowed money from a friend or relative.

“This is the sad reality of life for people who are in working poverty in the UK,” said Katherine Chapman, director at Living Wage Foundation. “We’ve seen the increasing use of food banks and other worrying trends. That’s why it’s more important than ever that employers are showing leadership and standing up and making a public commitment to paying the living wage.”

The foundation, which will announce the new hourly living wage rate on Monday, said that with the cost of living rising at its fastest pace in four years, the need for a living wage has become paramount.

A third of FTSE 100 companies as well as Google, Everton, Liverpool and Chelsea football clubs pay the RLW, and more than 150,000 employees have received a pay rise as a result of the campaign. More than £600m has been paid to workers since it began in earnest in 2011.

“In the last couple of years we’ve seen certain sectors, like retail, really grow,” Chapman said. “Ikea signing up a couple of years ago was huge. The movement has grown from strength to strength. In the past year alone we’ve accredited more than a thousand employers.”

However, a separate poll for consultancy giant KPMG before this week’s living wage week found that more than one in five people in the UK are still earning below the RLW. While the number has dropped by 100,000 to around 5.5 million since last year, the first reduction in five years, it means a million more people earning below the RLW than in 2012.

Part-time workers are particularly vulnerable to low pay. Around 3.1 million part-time employees earn less than the RLW compared with 2.4 million full-time workers, according to KPMG.

The KPMG research found that a deep gender divide continues to operate. One in four – 26% – of women earn less than the RLW, compared with 16% of men.

Almost three-fifths of those earning below the RLW said they had experienced a sharp increase in the cost of living. There is also acute regional variation. Some 26% of workers in Northern Ireland earn below the RLW, the highest proportion in the UK, and a quarter of workers in the East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, Wales and the West Midlands are also earning below the threshold.

Andy Bagnall, director at KPMG UK, said that, historically, some businesses believed that paying the real living wage would hit them financially. But he suggested there was evidence to the contrary. “In the past, many businesses were worried that increased wages would hit their bottom line, but there is ample evidence to suggest otherwise.

“By paying the real living wage since 2006, KPMG has seen improved staff morale, a rise in service standards, improved retention of staff and increased productivity. More importantly, it has been an enabler for social mobility.”"

Among the detained princes was Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world’s richest men and a top investor in media giant NewsCorp, Twitter and other major companies, according to the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.

The arrests were carried out by a new anti-corruption committee chaired by Prince Muhammad, according to state-owned Al Alarabiya TV.

The cabinet reshuffle saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah replaced as minister of the National Guard by Khaled bin Ayyaf, while Economy Minister Adel Fakieh was removed in favor of his deputy Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, according to a royal decree carried by state-run media.

Prince Miteb, the preferred son of the late King Abdullah, was once thought to be a leading contender for the throne before the unexpected rise of Prince Mohammed two years ago.

He had inherited control of the National Guard, an elite internal security force built out of traditional tribal units, from his father, who ran it for five decades.

Prince Miteb was the last remaining member of Abdullah’s branch of the family to hold a position in the upper echelons of the Saudi power structure.

The move consolidates Crown Prince Mohammed’s control of the kingdom’s security institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

The alleged targeting of Prince Alwaleed is especially striking because he is one of the most visible Saudi power players not directly under Prince Mohammed’s control. He has gained further attention in recent years because of his criticism of President Donald Trump, who’s built close ties with Prince Muhammad and hours before the announcements of the arrests unexpectedly tweeted about Saudi Arabia’s plan to publicly float part of its state-owned oil company for the first time.

Prince Mohammed, the king’s 32-year-old son, already serves as defense minister and was named heir to the throne in a June reshuffle that sidelined his older cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef who had also served as interior minister.

He has been responsible at the same time for running Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, dictating an energy policy with global implications and behind the plans for the kingdom to build a future after oil.

Prince Mohammed, who has pledged to go after graft at the highest levels, will now also head up the new anti-corruption body, which was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and freeze assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

NEW ECONOMY MINISTER

The country’s new economy minister, Tuwaijri, is a former Saudi air force pilot and former chief executive of HSBC’s Middle East operations who has led the economy ministry’s program to privatize some $200 billion of government assets.

He replaces Fakieh, who served as the point man for the kingdom’s wide-ranging economic reforms since his appointment as economy and planning minister in 2015.

A former food executive with a reputation for pushing through politically sensitive reforms, Fakieh had previously served as labor minister, health minister and mayor of Jeddah.

Fakieh faced down fierce opposition from the business community as labor minister when he established quotas for foreign workers to boost jobs for Saudis.

Under Prince Mohammed, Fakieh led the development of a national transformation plan and privatization drive launched last year to end the kingdom’s vulnerability to an unpredictable oil market. His replacement comes as the kingdom makes adjustments to that plan, a process dubbed NTP 2.0.

The royal decree did not say whether Fakieh would hold any other government position. Former ministers often serve in advisory roles after leaving their posts."
Hilary Hanson,The author of a new book on the Bush presidents revealed some of their true thoughts on Trump.,2017-11-04T16:15:18Z,the-huffington-post,"George H.W. Bush Called Trump A 'Blowhard' And Said, 'I Don't Like Him'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-hw-bush-blowhard-trump_us_59fdd428e4b04cdbeb33761e,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fdd5d31400003001d7ee2c.jpeg?cache=ga5ah3bg6t&ops=1910_1000,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"An upcoming book shows that former President George H.W. Bush did not mince words when asked about President Donald Trump, back before Trump had won the election.

“I don’t like him,” Bush told historian Mark Updegrove in May 2016, according to The New York Times. “I don’t know much about him, but I know he’s a blowhard. And I’m not too excited about him being a leader.” Bush added that Trump appeared to be driven by “a certain ego.”

Updegrove’s book, “The Last Republicans,” deals with the relationship between the senior Bush and his son, former President George W. Bush. The title was inspired by a quote from the younger Bush, who told him during the 2016 election, “I’m worried that I will be the last Republican president.”

“And it wasn’t just about Hillary Clinton becoming president, as the Republican Party was having a difficult time finding itself,” Updegrove told CNN. “It was because Donald Trump represented everything that the Bushes abhorred.”

The elder Bush also said that he voted for Clinton in 2016, while his son said he voted for “none of the above” as president and Republican candidates on the rest of the ballot.

Their newly revealed criticisms of Trump come just weeks after George W. Bush appeared to criticize the president at a New York policy seminar, though he didn’t mention Trump by name.

“We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty,” Bush said. “We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America.”

The White House responded to news of the criticisms Saturday morning, saying in a statement, “If one Presidential candidate can disassemble a political party, it speaks volumes about how strong a legacy its past two presidents really had.”

Though liberals have historically been sharp critics of the younger Bush — for reasons including the decision to invade Iraq, a slow and widely panned response to Hurricane Katrina, and his administration’s wholesale embrace of torture — his star has risen in the Trump era. In the wake of Trump’s frequent inflammatory comments and constant ad hominem attacks on Twitter, many people seem to long for a president who maintained a relatively more dignified demeanor.

An October survey showed that 51 percent of Democrats hold at least a somewhat favorable view of Bush. On Friday, former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann — who has previously called Bush a fascist and a liar — said he owed Bush an apology and would prefer a third Bush term to Trump as president. Last year, the public went wild with glee over a photo showing Bush and Michelle Obama enjoying a brief embrace."

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was attacked at his home in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on Friday afternoon, according to a police report. Paul suffered minor injuries to his face and a rib.

Rene Albert Boucher, 59, has been charged with fourth-degree assault with a minor injury, a misdemeanor, according to arrest records. He was being held Saturday afternoon at the Warren County Regional Jail in lieu of a $5,000 bond. No details were released by police on what precipitated the attack.

The FBI is “involved making sure it wasn’t politically motivated,” a police spokesman told WBKO-TV.

“We are working with our state and local partners to determine if there was a violation of federal law,” FBI spokesman David Habich told USA Today.

Fox News reported that Boucher allegedly attacked the senator and one-time presidential candidate as Paul, 54, was mowing his lawn.

A neighbor told WAVE3-TV that the two men had an ongoing feud. Boucher is a registered Democrat.

According to the arrest warrant obtained by WKBO and the Bowling Green Daily News, Paul told police that his neighbor walked onto his property and tackled him from behind, forcing him to the ground. Police were called to the home shortly before 3:30 p.m. Friday.

The senator’s injury did not require treatment at a hospital. The arrest warrant said that Boucher admitted to tackling Paul.

“Senator Paul was blindsided and the victim of an assault,” his spokeswoman Kelsey Cooper said in a statement. “The assailant was arrested and it is now a matter for the police. Senator Paul is fine.”

The Bowling Green Daily News reported that Boucher is a local anesthesiologist and pain specialist who developed a cloth vest product designed to relieve back pain.

State Police Master Trooper Jeremy Hodges told The Associated Press that he couldn’t reveal any other details of the assault because of security issues."

Manafort is set to appear in court again on Monday morning for a hearing on the conditions of his release following his arrest last week on 12 federal counts, including conspiracy and money laundering. He and his business associate Rick Gates have pleaded not guilty to the charges brought forward by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said at Manafort’s second court hearing on Thursday that she was concerned that he posed a flight risk. In a court filing on Saturday, Manafort’s lawyers assured the judge that the reason he had three passports was “mundane”: He has a primary passport, a second passport to submit with visa applications to certain foreign countries, and a third that he applied for after he lost his primary passport, which he later found.

Manafort’s “frequent flyer status,” lawyer Kevin Downing wrote, “should not be over-emphasized to show a potential risk of flight when a person’s job requires extensive travel.” He said that Manafort was just a “successful domestic and international political consultant” who “traveled frequently and represented businessmen, political parties, and commercial interests around the world,” activities that were “completely” legal.

“It would be odd, indeed, if he did not frequently travel, both domestically and abroad, given his clientele and the nature of his business,” Downing wrote.

He also noted that Manafort has been married for almost 40 years and has two daughters and two grandchildren in the U.S. He said that his client’s primary assets are also in the United States.

One of the charges that Manafort is facing relates to his alleged failure to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires lobbyists to disclose when they’re working on behalf of a foreign principal. Downing, not incorrectly, said that particular charge was “rarely pursued (or successfully prosecuted) in a criminal case.”

Manafort is currently on house arrest under electronic monitoring and a $10 million unsecured bond. He’s seeking less onerous conditions of release. To guarantee his future court appearances, his attorney said Manafort would be willing to pledge a $3 million Trump Tower apartment in New York City, another $3.5 million home in New York, a $1.5 million home in Palm Beach, Florida, and a “combination of life insurance policies held in trust and/or in his or his wife’s name” and valued at approximately $4.5 million ― for a total of more than $12 million.

Although Manafort has not yet reached an agreement with prosecutors over the conditions of his release, his lawyers wrote that he would agree to limit his travel to Florida, Virginia, New York and Washington, D.C. Prosecutors with Mueller’s office are expected to file their response to the Manafort filing on Sunday.

On Thursday, Jackson seemed open to lifting Manafort’s house arrest but skeptical of removing his electronic monitoring."

Right now, minors in Wisconsin must be at least 14 years old to hunt alone, a spokesperson with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources told HuffPost. Children aged 12 and 13 can hunt with a parent or guardian if they have obtained a hunting safety certificate.

And kids who are 10 or 11 years old can hunt without completing a safety course if they are taking part in “mentored hunt.” That means they’re accompanied by an adult who has a hunting license and the pair follows certain rules, like the child only being able to hunt within an arm’s reach of the mentor.

But Assembly Bill 455 would remove any age restrictions from mentored hunters, meaning that children younger than 10 could participate. Democratic Rep. Katrina Shankland warned that the measure would let “a toddler, a two-year-old” carry a gun, posing a major risk to other people in the woods.

While the bill has received a lot of attention on social media, Wisconsin is far from the first state to introduce such legislation. The AP notes that 34 other states already have no minimum hunting age, according to the Wisconsin Hunters’ Rights Coalition.

“We’re returning the choice to the parent,” the bill’s author, Republican Rep. Rob Stafsholt, told reporters on Friday, boasting that he could handle a .22 caliber rifle at 8 years old.

Parents in the state are very split on the measure, local news station WBAY reported.

“I think we’re losing sight of why the original law was put into place. It was put into place to protect children,” Joe Slattery, who opposes eliminating the minimum age, told the station.

But another parent, Jordan Schuld, said he believes parents are able to judge their own children’s limitations. However, he said that on a mentor hunt, he still thinks the adult and child should only have one weapon between them.

The state Senate will likely vote on the bill Tuesday, and it would need to be signed by Gov. Scott Walker (R) in order to become law."

And President Donald Trump is steamed at him again, this time ostensibly for not investigating Hillary Clinton and various other Democrats.

But the American people might be better off with Sessions right where he is at the head of the Justice Department, Rachel Maddow argued on Friday night. Because if Trump does force him out of office, or he resigns, that opens the door to a new attorney general who hasn’t recused himself from the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.

The MSNBC host counts Trump’s latest slam against Sessions as the president’s fourth round of attacks on him. Regardless of what Trump might specifically criticize, Maddow said she suspects the key issue is always that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe and that the president would like to take the driver’s seat on that investigation with the help of a more compliant attorney general.

“If Trump fires him, he will replace Sessions with somebody not recused from overseeing the Russian investigation,” Maddow said. And what would Trump want that new person to do? she wondered.

“If you think the Russia attack [on the U.S. election] and the possibility that the Trump campaign was in on it is a serious national security matter for this country, a serious political crisis for this country, what’s worse: having an attorney general of the United States, a serving attorney general, who is up to his neck in that scandal ... or not having that attorney general, who is up to his neck in that scandal?”

“If you’re Congress and you want to go after the bad actors in this scandal, should you go after Jeff Sessions? Or is Jeff Sessions the one person you absolutely should not go after under any circumstances ... ’cause he needs to stay?”"

Ravi Bhalla, who is running for mayor of Hoboken, posted a photo of the flyer on Facebook. It has a picture of Bhalla, a Sikh who wears the traditional turban, with the words “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our Town!” directly above him.

The flyer also warns of a “potential conflict of interest” regarding the city’s water supplier, which is a client of the law firm where Bhalla is a partner. That issue, however, has no connection with terrorism and the explanation of the conflict appears in much smaller print.

“Of course, this is troubling, but I want to be clear: We won’t let hate win in Hoboken,” Bhalla wrote on Facebook. “I want people to know that Hoboken is a welcoming community where my wife and I are proud to raise our two young children.”

Sikhs have repeatedly been the victims of hate crimes and harassment by people who mistake them for Muslims. A 2015 study conducted by the National Sikhs Campaign found that 20 to 28 percent of Americans misidentify Sikh men as Middle Eastern or Muslim. A large part of that is due to the turbans that Sikh men wear as part of their faith.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) tweeted in defense of Bhalla to denounce the flyers. Booker served as mayor of nearby Newark from 2006 to 2013, before running for Congress.

“My friend @RaviBhalla is running for Hoboken mayor,” Booker wrote. “This vile hateful flyer was put out. I condemn it! We all must condemn bigotry & hate!”

The flyer falsely tying Bhalla to terrorism showed up just days before voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Language on the flyer claims it was paid for by a rival mayoral candidate, Michael DeFusco, who denies any association with the item.

This wasn’t a matter of fake news; this was “real” news made a little less so.

The Boston Globe quoted @Pamela_Moore13, who hated a Stephen Colbert joke about Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. NBC News, in the aftermath of the Pulse night club shooting, gave space to @lgbtunitedcom on the subject of the Chicago gay pride parade. Vox and HuffPost both turned to the thoughts of @Crystal1Johnson, the former on the bullet holes in an Emmett Till sign and the latter on quadruplets attending Yale together.

We know now that these were trolls working on behalf of the Russian government. Without knowing, we laughed or scowled at their jokes. We mocked or cheered their opinions. We looked at their photos and watched their videos, and few if any of us batted an eye as they covertly shaped the way we looked at our own country.

This week, Congress released a list of 2,752 accounts that Twitter identified as tied to the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm through which the Kremlin conducts international and domestic influence operations, including during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The accounts have all since been deleted, but I decided to Google more than 1,000 of them to find out just how often and in what ways they were able to embed themselves in the work of U.S. news organizations. The vast majority that I checked never made it into stories, but more than 20 did in myriad ways and in all types of organizations.

In total, I found more than 40 examples of the accounts weaseling their way into articles. Organizations that embedded or used tweets from the Russian troll farm included Mashable, The Telegraph, NBC News, ATTN:, the Washington Post, Vox, RT, Medium, Salon, Fox News, the Miami Herald, CNN, BuzzFeed, Thought Catalog, Newser, the New York Post, The Blaze, Breitbart, the Boston Globe, Vice, Circa, Complex, the Los Angeles Times, the Daily Dot, The Daily Caller, the Washington Examiner and our site, HuffPost.

This was hardly an infiltration. We, the media, practically let the trolls in the front door. Thanks to the cockeyed incentives of online publishing, all they had to do was knock.

Method No. 1: Embed the photos and videos news organizations want for free

HuffPost

The most effective way for Russian troll accounts to end up in news posts was simple: They tweeted newsworthy photos and videos, even if they were not the ones that shot them. Buying photos is an expensive and complicated process for news organizations, which have become increasingly happy to embed tweets that include the photos they desire as something of a workaround. It’s free, easy and legally colorable. The only issue, it ends up, is that you might be embedding a tweet created by a Russian troll farm as part of a massive conspiracy to influence the American political system.

Sometimes, entire stories were based around a Russian account’s video, as was the case with a Complex post from August titled “Donald Trump Claims His 17-Day Vacation Isn’t Really a Vacation.” The post included a tweet from Trump and a video from the aforementioned @Pamela_Moore13, a prolific Russian troll farm account that has appeared in news articles at least a dozen times since October 2016.

Complex

In 2015, The Washington Post wrote a story entitled “Russian TV channel sees Putin in the sky above New York,” which was based around a video “by someone named Sheryl Gilbert.” Gilbert had the handle @_SherylGilbert, which has been identified as part of the Russian troll farm. “Gregory West, who claims to be the husband of Sheryl Gilbert,” had the handle @DrGregoryWest, also associated with the farm. The story was consequently picked up by news outlets including the New York Post and Newser.

HuffPost

Method No. 2: Make a joke off of a trending topic or hashtag

In the last few years, news organizations have found that an easy and quick way to gobble up internet traffic is to round up funny tweets related to one topic and throw them under a captivating headline ― sometimes with a larger point, sometimes not.

More troubling, Russian troll accounts ended up in news articles as a representation of the American people ― a faster, cheaper way into the minds and moods of Americans than the classic “Area Man” interview. Such was the case with the Fox News article “Trump supporters vow to boycott Starbucks over CEO’s plan to hire refugees,” in which two of the four Trump supporters supplied as evidence came from a Russian troll account:

They both get their backs scrubbed by an eager Kate McKinnon as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Beck Bennet’s Mike Pence (wearing a suit because he’s not “married to water”) — and “Trump” can make certain Manafort isn’t wearing a wire.

It’s too late, the “president” concedes, to help Harvey Weinstein extricate himself from a burgeoning sex harassment and assault scandal. “What an idiot that Harvey Weinstein is,” Baldwin tells Moffat. “He could have gotten away with it all if only he had gotten himself elected president.”

As for Manafort, Baldwin suggests he dress up like a turkey so the president can pardon him at Thanksgiving — but warns the family might bungle it and end up eating him. “It’s shame you’re going to prison,” Baldwin’s Trump tells his former campaign manager. “I was about to give you a yuge tax break.”

McKinnon warns that maybe they should all get used to “wearing strips.” That’s “why I’m wearing a bathing costume that I got from my favorite place — the 1890s.”

If he gets in trouble “Sessions” plans to “roll over and play dead like the half-possum I am.”

Trump is supposed to be on his way to his Asia tour, but has replaced himself on Air Force One with a Donald doll. Cecily Strong’s Melania, sitting next to the big dummy, is delighted.

It hasn't been the only one breaking more records than a dissatisfied DJ, as Wonder Woman has just been announced as the most successful superhero origin film ever.

The movie overtook the original Spiderman from way back in 2002 - arguably the film that sparked the whole revival of the superhero genre - with a total gross of over $800 million worldwide.

#WonderWoman is now the highest grossing Superhero origin film of all time! After a final international push, the film reached $821.74 million, passing Raimi's Spider-Man! Congrats @PattyJenks! pic.twitter.com/8b9xon35Ny - ComicBook Debate (@ComicBookDebate) November 2, 2017

Wonder Woman garnered widespread acclaim when it was released back in June, gaining critical success and a 92% Rotten Tomatoes rating, with particular attention drawn to its strong female lead, played by Israeli actress Gal Gadot.

Alongside the financial rewards, there is talk of award success as well, with Forbes stating this week that: ""Warner is giving Wonder Woman a heavy Oscar push, including for Best Picture and Best Director. While you may think financial success doesn't matter much in Academy Award considerations, you'd be mistaken.""

Of course, there is a dispute about whether Wonder Woman has actually taken more than Spiderman. It's basically impossible for any film to be the highest-grossing anything without at least a modicum of debate around it.

Forbes is clear on this: ""The exchange rate for dollars, length of a film's theatrical run and rereleases, the amount of competition in the marketplace from pictures with similar target demographics, amount of home entertainment competition compared to theatrical draw, competition from the Internet and streaming services, vast global piracy of movies nowadays, the particular role of a given film in the historic context for its genre and its own franchise, number of foreign screens and domestic screens, and many other issues come into play when discussing this matter.""



via GIPHY

Given that they're the folks who compile the lists of richest people in the world every year, we'll defer to their greater knowledge.



Nay-sayers might well point out that, if adjusted from 2002 (when Spiderman was released) to 2017, the Sam Raimi effort actually comes to somewhere near $1.1 billion, comfortably more than Wonder Woman.

That aside, the idea that a female-lead, female-directed movie about a female superhero could make such an impact on the traditionally male-dominated world of comic book movies is a major success without any takings at all.

So here's to you, Wonder Woman. And in all likelihood, Wonder Woman 2. And 3. And 4. Until everyone gets bored.

It's a 10-hour flight and you're in the middle seat, meaning you'll have to climb over the person next to the aisle if you need to stretch your legs.

Oh wait, the person in front has just reclined their seat (which they're perfectly entitled to do). You're already uncomfortable and the plane hasn't even left the tarmac left.

It's also a cruel experience that the different seating classes are blocked off - or even worse, when passengers have to walk through Business to get to Economy, realising all the beautiful things they won't have.

via GIPHY

For those who play by the rules, they know they should stick to their assigned seat and try to find solace in the on-flight entertainment. But we all know those people who sprint faster than Usain Bolt to the back of the plane to call baggsies on an empty row.

However, there is a way to be one step ahead of the game to secure that free row in Economy, or at least an empty seat next to you, barring of course the flight being full.

It's usually when you use those self-serve kiosks at check-in when you get an indication of what seats will be available for your flight. Sure, you could take a picture of the seating chart or memorise where the vacant rows or seats are, but it could all change by the time everyone boards the flight.

Gilbert Ott, who created the site God Save The Points, says the app ExpertFlyer provides a seating chart that is constantly updated - giving you the best knowledge of where you might be able to bag some extra leg room.

In the blog post, Gilbert says: ""A smart flyer (which you clearly are) sees the cabin as a game of musical chairs. If the best seat in the house is available immediately - book it.



""If not, get the next best available seat - and set free alerts on ExpertFlyer for any and all the seats you'd prefer. By doing so, you can keep improving up until final boarding.

""Once everyone else has settled their fate, you can often stand in the boarding line with your app open seeing if final seating assignments have created any opportunities - like an entire row to yourself. It really does happen.""

Having that up your sleeve might let you get an empty seat next to you, or even better, a whole row to stretch your legs out and worry about something else.

Shoppers in Istanbul who have allegedly seen the tags, claim the Turkish workers aren't being paid for their time.

According to Associated Press, one of the tags says: ""I made this item you are going to buy, but I didn't get paid for it.""

The tags claim the workers are employed by third-party manufacturer Bravo, which has since closed down and left staff without three months of pay or severance allowance. Bravo factories also produce clothing for Next and Mango.

A spokesperson for Inditex, the company that owns Zara, told Refinery29: """"Inditex has met all of its contractual obligations to Bravo Textil [sic] and is currently working on a proposal with the local IndustriALL affiliate, Mango, and Next to establish a hardship fund for the workers affected by the fraudulent disappearance of the Bravo factory's owner.

Credit: PA



""This hardship fund would cover unpaid wages, notice indemnity, unused vacation, and severance payments of workers that were employed at the time of the sudden shutdown of their factory in July 2016. We are committed to finding a swift solution for all of those impacted.""

The reports come just a few weeks after Inditex, the company that owns Zara, issued a media release explaining how it was doing its best to 'spread best labour practices in the garment industry'.

It reads: ""The Chairman and CEO of Inditex, Pablo Isla, today met with the Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO), Guy Ryder, with the goal of reinforcing the projects on which the two entities are collaborating with the aim of enhancing labour conditions at all levels of the garment sector value chain.



Reports of the tags being sewn into the clothes is just another controversy involving the retailer since it was founded in Spain in 1974.

In 2011, a Brazilian investigation accused the company of using suppliers who were running sweatshops for their production. Authorities in São Paulo eventually closed that factory after dozens of workers were found to be operating in 'unsanitary conditions'.

Credit: PA



It was also revealed that the factory was employing people as young as 14 and staff were made to work for 16 hours each day. It was also alleged that they were being paid well below the country's minimum wage.



Seamstress Maria Susicleia told Veja: ""It was a stuffy place, dimly lit, unventilated, smelly; the windows were kept closed so no one knew there was a sewing workshop there.""



The company responded, saying it was 'serious breach in accordance with the Code of Conduct for External Manufacturers and Workshops of Inditex,' and ordered all the factories taking part in the unauthorised outsourcing to rectify the issue.

The company also faced accusations last year that it had stolen designs from different independent designers. Zara claimed the similarities between their products and other designer's looks weren't distinctive enough, however, once the claims were covered by news organisations, Inditex said the items had been taken down.

But the 2008 film was truly brought to life thanks to Tom Hardy's enthralling depiction of Michael Gordon Peterson/Charles Bronson.

Despite appearing in a raft of decent films, TV shows and stage performances, Bronson catapulted Hardy into stardom.

The film has been out for nearly a decade and people could only watch it either on DVD (does anyone buy them anymore?) or online. Thankfully, Netflix has come to the rescue and has finally featured the film on its streaming service.

The inclusion has got a lot of people hungry to watch the film for the first time, or relive the epic story.

- LR Reality (@RealityCS) November 1, 2017

Tom Hardy did everything he can to become the man who has spent the majority of his life in prison. The pair spoke on the phone several times and eventually Hardy travelled to prison to meet him. Bronson was impressed by the actor's dedication to the role with his diary entries revealing he was a big fan.

The 64-year-old wrote: ""He has put on one and a half stone of muscles for the movie. He looks awesome and I'm so fucking proud of him.

""You wouldn't want to meet him down a dark alley at 3am. Tom looks more like me than I look like me.""

The entries even revealed that Bronson had chopped off his infamous moustache so he could mail it to Tom Hardy so the make-up artists could stick it on the actor or just 'for luck'.

Hardy says it was an intense journey to physically become the famed prisoner, telling Ask Men: ""It was a race against the clock. We didn't have any time to waste, so I started eating and my arse very quickly got very fat.

""For Bronson, I put on about 7lbs a week-with no steroids.

""In the end, I'd put on about two and a half stone by eating chicken and rice, which was my staple diet throughout the day. Then I'd have a pizza, Häagen-Dazs, and Coca-Cola. So not good stuff, but I had to put weight on.

""I needed to put a layer of fat on my body because Bronson - when he was younger - was a big guy, a brawler. My diet was lenient as we weren't going for the Bruce Lee look and we weren't looking for the cut.""

So if you're a fan of British crime movies, then this one might be perfect.

When the scary, black parasite from another planet latches onto a human host, it gives them muscles on muscles on muscles.

The actor knew he'd have to do a lot of work to become the character, who is most notably known as Spider Man's ultimate nemesis. In addition to probably a massive diet, Hardy has been doing boxing, kickboxing and MMA work to get hench.

His trainers, Nathan Jones and Mark Mene, haven't held back getting the actor into shape.

Mark says: ""Training Tom Hardy, what I found surprising was actually his humility, he was very humble, down to earth. And you're able to communicate with him. I'm impressed, he's definitely going to live up to the character, because, you know, he's dealing with a guy that turns into an 8ft tall beast.

""The fact that Tommy is able to get into these really uncomfortable situations for training and he's able to recoup and gather himself and carry on with it, it's impressive.

""What the world is going to see is one of the darkest, most powerful super villains that Marvel's ever created. It's going to be carnage.""

Apparently, they started him on three to four training sessions a week, but Hardy got hungry and requested five per week and even two in one day.

It's similar to the training he did for the 2011 film Warrior, where he played an MMA champion, and when he stared as the villain Bane in Batman: The Dark Knight Rises.

The Venom film will be the first in several films set in Sony's new Spider-Man universe, which is being rebooted this year for the second time with Spider-Man: Homecoming.



Back in May, it was announced that Hardy will play Eddie Brock, a freelance photographer who is taken over by the sentient alien lifeform in Marvel's original Spider-Man comics. The character was previously played by Topher Grace in 2007's Spider-Man 3, which was Tobey Maguire's last outing as Spider-Man in the original trilogy of Spider-Man films.

According to the Daily Mail, Tom fell during while filming in Atlanta for Venom and production had to be delayed. But the film is very much just getting started, with the release date not expected in the US until October 5 next year.

We absolutely cannot wait for this one.

Sometimes it's coherent and witty and other times it's a jumbled mess of awful spelling, grammar and syntax.

But one woman has taken the cake for the most random, weird-yet-interesting comment.

Christine MCM, she was responding to an article on the New York Times about the relationship between the Republican party and President Donald Trump. There were more than 550 comments about the article, but Christine's stood out.

""Zero optimism that the Democrats can ever regain Hello hi oh you're there are you outside,"" she wrote, ""oh well let me come to the door I'm icing my knee and I'm hard boiling some eggs I'll turn them off and then will do our meeting yet out that that will be fine I'm Normans out doing some errands and he knows you're coming so he'll just go down to the cave I was down in the Cape myself this morning by getting so let me get up because I'm right now sort of trapped in my chair and then I'll put the ice pack back on when you get here OK thanks bye-bye.""

Some people spent weeks, months and even years writing witty comments, hoping to be slotted into the New York Times Picks section, and yet Christine got there with this ramble.

Her comment sparked more comments, with one person saying it was more coherent than President Trump himself.

Another user said: ""Love it! Christine is getting into performance art. More please.""

Even the New York Times wrote back to her, saying: ""Hope your knee feels better!""

via GIPHY

Christine, who seemed quite embarrassed by the mishap, replied to her own comment to clear up the confusion about what she wrote.

She said: ""This was a mistake I'll need to report to the NYT. I was composing a message using the autospeak, and a friend arrived early to my house. I had no idea all that drivel was being recorded - there are even errors in the drivel!

""And then to be a pick, with about 15 emails announcing such, meant that my email went rogue. Yes, folks, I guess I do sound like Sarah Palin here!""

We're all hoping that with Christine's new found internet fame, she will still take time to get that knee back into working order.

That's what one man from Swansea, South Wales has faced since waking up the day after a stag night in Blackpool - with a pair of sunglasses tattooed to his face.

Credit: Wales News Service



He has since spent the last two years undergoing gradual laser treatment to finally have the fake sunglasses removed.

""I had no memory of getting the tattoo because I had gone out celebrating and it happened when I was drunk,"" said the 50-something, who spoke with MailOnline on condition of not being named.

""Waking up the morning after, I thought someone had used a permanent marker on my face. When I first came home, obviously I was subject to a lot of stares, but I kind of got used to the tattoo and decided not to get rid of it.""

The tattoo, which the man requested as a drunken dare, includes the name of sunglasses brand Ray-Ban. Although he planned to keep his brand new ink at first, he changed his mind after someone mocked him while he was on another night out in the pub.

""The next morning I really started to think about what my family and friends thought,"" he said. ""I didn't want them to be embarrassed when they were out with me, so I decided there and then I was going to get it removed.""

Credit: Wales News Service



The man has since been visiting 1192 Laser and Beauty Clinic in Swansea to have the tattoo removed, after the clinic's owner Donnalee Alford said it was one of the worst tattoo mistakes she had ever seen.

Although the six treatments the man has received have left him with some turquoise markings around his eyes, those are expected to clear up eventually, allowing him to take his glasses off once and for all.

""All I can say is that the whole process was amazing,"" the man said. ""There is no scarring, and when friends who haven't seen me for months come over, they always notice something is different.

""When they realise the tattoo is gone, they are shocked about how well the treatment has worked.""

All in all, it looks like this was an embarrassing blunder. Maybe the bloke should just get some real Ray-Ban glasses next time.

But the latest film to be getting its own TV show reboot could be the most impressive yet - according to Variety, Amazon and Warner Bros Television are in talks with the Tolkien estate about a Lord of the Rings series.

How cool would that be?

Variety reports that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is very keen on a series based on the novels and is personally involved with the negotiations, as he's a huge fan of fantasy movies.

Before we get too excited, it's worth pointing out that it's all still very early stages and that nothing concrete has been announced yet. When asked by Variety, representatives from Warner Bros Television and Amazon declined to comment. So it looks like we'll have to be patient and wait, which is easier said than done.

Warner Bros and the Tolkien estate has recently settled a five-year-long court battle over an $80 million dispute over The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. The Tolkien estate and The Lord of the Rings' publisher HarperCollins filed the lawsuit claiming a copyright infringement and breach of contract over digital merchandising, including online gambling machines and video games.

The successful movie franchise, which were produced by Warner Bros, were released in 2001, 2002 and 2003 and have gained an army of die-hard fans across the world. However, Peter Jackson's follow up film series - The Hobbit - was less popular.

If done well, this could be the perfect show to fill the void when Game of Thrones finishes at the end of the next season. At least until the spin-off shows start.

What do you guys reckon? Do you think a TV show would do the notoriously long books justice? Or do you think Warner Bros should be happy with the Peter Jackson franchise and call it quits?

Think Al Pacino in The Godfather, Jack Nicholson in The Shining, Anthony Hopkins in The Silence Of The Lambs and most recently, the late great Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight.

Ledger's performance will no doubt go down in history as one of the greatest of all time and, according to Ranker.com's results for the 'Best Movie Villains Of All Time', the people of the internet know it.

The Joker came in first place with a staggering 17,376 upvotes - almost 10,000 more than Darth Vader in second place.

Here's the full top 10:

1. The Joker - The Dark Knight

2. Darth Vader - Star Wars universe

3. Hannibal Lecter - The Silence Of The Lambs

4. Lord Voldemort - Harry Potter universe

5. Freddy Krueger - Nightmare On Elm Street universe

6. Jack Torrance - The Shining

7. Palpatine - Star Wars universe

8. Agent Smith - The Matrix universe

9. Terminator - The Terminator

10. Magneto - The X-Men universe

It's no wonder the Joker came in first place really. Ledger poured his heart and soul into the part and the fact that the role was to be his last makes his performance all the more poignant.

Having originally been asked by director Christopher Nolan to play the title character in Batman Begins, Ledger declined, saying that he would 'never do this type of film"" and the role went to Christian Bale.

However, when it came to securing Ledger for the role of the Joker, Nolan didn't have to do much persuading, saying that instead, 'Heath chose me'.

""He just was determined to do it,"" Nolan said during a Q&A at the Film Society of Lincoln Center.

""He just had a vision for something, and the way he termed it to me at the time was, he really didn't like to work too much.

""He liked to do a character and then stop working then let enough time go by. He wanted to be hungry for it. And when he came to me, he was clearly in that state: Very hungry. He was ready to do something like that and just own it - which is what he did.""

After his death, Ledger's father appeared in a documentary and showed viewers his son's personal diary/scrapbook that he filled in while preparing for the part. It showed just how dedicated he had been.

""He pretty well locked himself up in a hotel room for weeks,"" Heath's dad Kim explains in the film.

""He galvanised the upcoming character. That was typical of Heath. He would do that. He liked to dive into his characters, but this time he really took it up a notch.""

Heart-breaking, eh?

That's exactly what some eager iPhone fans have done over in China, where there are reports of several clumsy customers totally destroying their new phones. How gutted would you be? Let's hope they had insurance.

The iPhone X features a glass front and back, as well as an edge-to-edge screen, which looks ace but means that if you drop it there are two sides that could end up getting smashed. It's also the first iPhone to use facial recognition to unlock the screen.

The highly anticipated phone, which Apple's CEO Tim Cook has said will 'set the path for technology for the next decade', was released just a few hours ago.

This poor fella is probably still crying. Credit: Asia Wire

As ever, there have been plenty of people willing to actually sleep outside to ensure they got their mitts on one.



The iPhone X is on sale for $999 in the US and, somewhat controversially, £999 in the UK ($999 is around £750, so Brits are having to fork out a lot more for the same product) and it seems like getting the thing fixed could be almost as pricey.



According to the Mirror, if you need the edge-to-edge screen fixed, it'll set you back £286.44 ($376.05). Business Insider has even more terrifying news, reporting that there is 'other damage' - stuff that isn't limited to the screen, like a broken speaker or mic - that price rockets up to £419 ($549). Fucking hell.

If you're one of the ones who managed to get yourself a shiny new iPhone today, do yourself a favour and make sure you get insured. The AppleCare+ insurance programme, which costs £129 ($168) for two years of coverage, means that if you do end up smashing your screen you'll only have to pay £25 (£32) to get your screen fixed. That has got to be worth the investment if you're a clumsy bastard.

Al Arabiya said that the anticorruption committee has the right to investigate, arrest, ban from travel, or freeze the assets of anyone it deems corrupt.

The Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, the de facto royal hotel, was evacuated on Saturday, stirring rumors that it would be used to house detained royals. The airport for private planes was closed, arousing speculation that the crown prince was seeking to block rich businessmen from fleeing before more arrests.

Prince Alwaleed was giving interviews to the Western news media as recently as late last month about subjects like so-called crypto currencies and Saudi Arabia’s plans for a public offering of shares in its state oil company, Aramco.

He has also recently sparred publicly with President Donald J. Trump. The prince was part of a group of investors who bought control of the Plaza Hotel in New York from Mr. Trump, and he also bought an expensive yacht from him as well. But in a twitter message in 2015 the prince called Mr. Trump “a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.”

Mr. Trump fired back, also on Twitter, that “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money.”

As president, Mr. Trump has developed a warm, mutually supportive relationship with the ascendant crown prince, who has rocketed from near obscurity in recent years to taking control of the country’s most important functions.

But his swift rise has also divided Saudis. Many applaud his vision, crediting him with addressing the economic problems facing the kingdom and laying out a plan to move beyond its dependence on oil.

Others see him as brash, power-hungry and inexperienced, and they resent him for bypassing his elder relatives and concentrating so much power in one branch of the family.

At least three senior White House officials, including the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were reportedly in Saudi Arabia last month for meetings that were undisclosed at the time.

Before sparring with Mr. Trump, Prince Alwaleed was publicly rebuffed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who rejected his $10 million donation for the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York because the prince had also criticized American foreign policy.

As powerful as the billionaire is, he is something of an outsider within the royal family — not a dissident, but an unusually outspoken figure on a variety of issues. He openly supported women driving long before the kingdom said it would grant them the right to do so, and he has long employed women in his orbit.

In 2015 he pledged to donate his fortune of $32 billion to charity after his death. It was unclear Saturday whether Saudi Arabia’s corruption committee might seek to confiscate any of his assets.

Saudi Arabia is an executive monarchy without a written Constitution or independent government institutions like a Parliament or courts, so accusations of corruption are difficult to evaluate. The boundaries between the public funds and the wealth of the royal family are murky at best, and corruption, as other countries would describe it, is believed to be widespread.

The arrests came a few hours after the king replaced the minister in charge of the Saudi national guard, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, who controlled the last of the three Saudi armed forces not yet considered to be under control of the crown prince.

The king named Crown Prince Mohammed the minister of defense in 2015. Earlier this year, the king removed Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as head of the interior ministry, placing him under house arrest and extending the crown prince’s influence over the interior ministry’s troops, which act as a second armed force.

Rumors have swirled since then that King Salman and his favorite son would soon move against Prince Mutaib, commander of the third armed force and himself a former contender for the crown."

Mr. Page acknowledged his meeting with Russian government officials during sharp questioning by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, according to a congressional official familiar with the exchange.

During another part of the testimony, Mr. Page was questioned about a trip to Budapest, although it was not immediately clear why. Mr. Page told The Times earlier this year that he had taken that trip around Labor Day weekend last year, but he said he had not met with any Russians.

“It was a short four-day trip over a long holiday weekend at the end of the summer,” Mr. Page said at the time. “I had a nice trip up the Danube, to the Visegrad castle, did a lot of sightseeing and went to a jazz club. Not much to report.”

Court records unsealed on Monday revealed that another campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, met in 2016 with Russians who said they had connections to the government and was told about “dirt” regarding Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” The court records were released by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian attempts to disrupt the presidential election last year and whether any of President Trump’s associates helped in that effort.

Mr. Page was questioned by the F.B.I. earlier this year and has also appeared before the grand jury as part of the special counsel’s inquiry.

The House Intelligence Committee is one of three congressional investigations that are also examining these issues.

Mr. Page’s trip to Moscow in July 2016 was never a secret, and during the trip, he gave a speech at a graduation ceremony at the New Economic School, a university there. But the trip was one of the triggers of a counterintelligence investigation begun by the F.B.I. later that month.

In his talk at the university, Mr. Page criticized American policy toward Russia in terms that echoed the position of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “Washington and other Western capitals have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change,” Mr. Page said.

His remarks accorded with Mr. Trump’s positive view of the Russian president, which had prompted speculation about what Mr. Trump saw in Mr. Putin — more commonly denounced in the United States as a ruthless, anti-Western autocrat.

Mr. Page left the Trump campaign not long after the trip, and since then, Mr. Trump’s advisers tried to distance the campaign from Mr. Page.

During another trip to Moscow, in December 2016, after Mr. Page had left the Trump campaign, he said he planned to meet with “business leaders and thought leaders.” At the time, a Kremlin spokesman said that no government officials planned to meet Mr. Page and that the Kremlin had never had any contact with him.

“We have learned about this from the press,” the spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told the news agency Interfax.

A former Navy officer and Annapolis graduate, Mr. Page was unknown in Washington foreign policy circles when Mr. Trump announced him as a member of his team of advisers in March 2016.

Mr. Page lived in Moscow from 2004 to 2007 while working as a junior investment banker for Merrill Lynch.

Mr. Page subsequently started his own investment firm, Global Energy Capital, and teamed up on some deals with a Russian businessman, Sergey Yatsenko. Mr. Yatsenko had been deputy chief financial officer for the Russian energy giant Gazprom, which is majority-owned by the government and has close ties to Mr. Putin.

Mr. Page was wrapped up — but not charged — in an F.B.I. investigation in 2013 that targeted people suspected of being Russian intelligence officers in New York. One of the of three men who was later charged with being an unregistered agent of a foreign power had met Mr. Page at an energy symposium, and was recorded describing him as having dreams of lucrative deals.

Mr. Page had said he did not know the man was an intelligence officer.

In a video of a December 2016 speech he gave in Moscow, Mr. Page told the audience that he had met with an executive of Rosneft, another major Russian energy company. He said that person was a “friend.”

His time on the Trump campaign was short, but he has described the experience as particularly meaningful.

“The half year I spent on the Trump campaign meant more to me than the five years I spent in the Navy,” he said in an interview earlier this year."
Peter Baker,A new book on the father-and-son presidents provides a glance at their apprehension over Mr. Trump’s rise to power and what it means for the country.,2017-11-05T06:48:11Z,the-new-york-times,Both Bush Presidents Worry Trump Is Blowing Up the G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/politics/bush-president-book-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/05/us/05dc-bushes/05dc-bushes-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Indeed, at one point during the 2016 presidential campaign, the younger Mr. Bush confided to the author, “I’m worried that I will be the last Republican president.”

That inspired the title of the book — which will be published Nov. 14 by HarperCollins — as a quote that seemed to carry a double meaning.

“At the time, I think he was concerned that Hillary Clinton would win,” Mr. Updegrove, the author of several books on the presidency, said in an interview. “But if you look at his values and those shared by his father and Ronald Reagan, they are very much in contrast to the values of the Republican Party today, in particular the platform that Donald Trump ran on, which is essentially protectionism and a certain xenophobia.”

The White House fired back with a statement on Saturday arguing that American voters chose an outsider to change a system of lifelong politicians beholden to special interests. “If they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.

In discussing Mr. Trump with Mr. Updegrove, the elder Mr. Bush was blunter. “I don’t like him,” Mr. Bush said in May 2016. “I don’t know much about him, but I know he’s a blowhard. And I’m not too excited about him being a leader.” Rather than being motivated by public service, Mr. Bush said Mr. Trump seemed to be driven by “a certain ego.”

The younger Mr. Bush was more circumspect, but also clearly disapproving. The Bushes felt stung by Mr. Trump’s ground-burning attacks that helped destroy the campaign of Jeb Bush, the son and brother of the presidents.

“You can either exploit the anger, incite it,” George W. Bush told Mr. Updegrove, “or you can come up with ideas to deal with it.” Jeb, he said, came up with solutions, “but it didn’t fit with the mood.”

“If you’re angry with the powers that be,” he added, “you’re angry with the so-called establishment, and there’s nothing more established than having a father and brother that have been president.”

When Mr. Trump first entered the race, Mr. Bush thought he would not last and was surprised by the real estate developer’s success at capturing the nomination. Still, he was not impressed.

When Mr. Trump declared that “I’m my own adviser,” Mr. Bush thought he did not understand the presidency. He also lamented Mr. Trump’s lack of humility. “As you know from looking at my family, it is a certain heritage, that’s what they expect, and we’re not seeing that” in Mr. Trump.

The release of the book comes weeks after the younger Mr. Bush delivered a speech seen as a rebuke of Mr. Trump’s approach to the presidency and the world.

Addressing a conference in New York, Mr. Bush decried what he called the “nativism” of today’s policies and the “casual cruelty” of today’s politics. Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Bush said that “bigotry seems emboldened” and “our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.”

Mr. Updegrove, the former director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum and now the founding chief executive of the National Medal of Honor Museum, got to know both Bushes in recent years and persuaded them to talk with him for a book on their relationship, a subject that they had been allergic to while their political careers were still active.

The two men disputed Shakespearean assumptions about father-son rivalries and insisted they remained close throughout the younger Mr. Bush’s presidency, despite suspicions about a rift over the Iraq war. But George W. Bush’s parents were clearly disturbed by the influence of Vice President Dick Cheney and neoconservative advisers.

The elder Mr. Bush, Mr. Updegrove reported, counseled his son to consider “shaking up the ticket” in 2004, meaning to replace Mr. Cheney as his running mate — just as the younger Mr. Bush suggested to his father about Vice President Dan Quayle in 1992. Like his father, the son disregarded the advice.

Barbara Bush told Mr. Updegrove that she believed Mr. Cheney changed because of his health troubles, including a heart attack followed by a stent operation shortly after the 2000 election. “I do think he was different,” she said. “I think his heart operation made a difference. I always liked him, but I didn’t like him so much for a while because I thought he hurt George. I wasn’t that fond of him. I think he pushed things a little too far right.”

The younger Mr. Bush resented the implication that anyone was steering him. “The fact that there was any doubt in anyone’s mind about who the president was blows my mind,” he said. He added that Mr. Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld, his defense secretary, “didn’t make one fucking decision.”

But he insisted Mr. Cheney served him well and said that the vice president’s sometimes dark reputation was inevitable. “I understand the way the system works,” he said. “Somebody has to be the bad guy.”"

“The climate has changed and is always changing,” Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said in the statement. “As the Climate Science Special Report states, the magnitude of future climate change depends significantly on ‘remaining uncertainty in the sensitivity of Earth’s climate’” to greenhouse gas emissions, he added.

Despite the scientific consensus presented in the report, the Environmental Protection Agency has scrubbed references to climate change from its website and barred its scientists from presenting scientific reports on the subject.

The E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, has said carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to warming. Rick Perry, the energy secretary, asserted Wednesday that “the science is out” on whether humans cause climate change.

Their agencies referred questions to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversaw the research.

The report has provoked consternation in scientific circles for months. Though the study has been in the works since 2015, several scientists said the election of Mr. Trump, who has labeled climate change a “canard” and appointed cabinet members who disputed the scientific consensus, caused them to worry the report would be blocked or buried.

That did not happen. Scientists who worked on the report said none of the 13 agencies that reviewed it tried to undermine its findings or change its wording.

“I’m quite confident to say there has been no political interference on the message,” said David Fahey, a NOAA scientist and a lead author of the report. “Whatever fears we had weren’t realized.”

Responsibility for approving the report fell to Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, who generally believes in the validity of climate science and thought the issue would have been a distraction from the tax push, according to an administration official with knowledge of the situation.

One of Mr. Cohn’s top policy deputies, Michael Catanzaro, had the authority to block, delay or change the report. But Mr. Catanzaro, a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush and former Speaker John A. Boehner, chose instead to follow the lead of the Obama administration by referring the report back to more than a dozen federal agencies for feedback.

That review, according to two people familiar with the process, went relatively smoothly, surprising some scientists who worked on the report who had expected more resistance.

The only significant turbulence, according to one person familiar with the process, came from a midlevel political appointee at the Department of Energy who grilled the report’s authors on changes that had been made to temperature and other climate data over the years. The authors responded by adding a more detailed explanation of their methodology and all of the agencies then gave their approval, the person said.

Mr. Trump was barely aware of the report’s existence, several White House officials said.

Some critics of climate change science attacked the report as the product of holdovers from the Obama administration and chastised the Trump administration for allowing it to be published.

“I’m saddened that they have decided they will let the permanent government, the civil servants, continue down this road without supervision,” said Myron Ebell, director of global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group.

Scientists said the report’s findings were clear.

“This new report simply confirms what we already knew. Human-caused climate change isn’t just a theory, it’s reality,” said Michael E. Mann, a professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University. “Whether we’re talking about unprecedented heat waves, increasingly destructive hurricanes, epic drought and inundation of our coastal cities, the impacts of climate change are no longer subtle. They are upon us. That’s the consensus of our best scientists, as laid bare by this latest report.”

The report says the Earth has set temperature highs for three years running, and six of the last 17 years are the warmest years on record for the globe. Weather catastrophes from floods to hurricanes to heat waves have cost the United States $1.1 trillion since 1980, and the report warns that such phenomena may become common.

“The frequency and intensity of extreme high temperature events are virtually certain to increase in the future as global temperature increases,” the report notes. “Extreme precipitation events will very likely continue to increase in frequency and intensity throughout most of the world.”

In the United States, the report finds that every part of the country has been touched by warming, from droughts in the Southeast to flooding in the Midwest to a worrying rise in air and ground temperatures in Alaska, and conditions will continue to worsen.

“This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,” the report states. “For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.”

The findings, other researchers said, create an unusual situation in which the government’s policies are in direct opposition to the science it is producing.

“This profoundly affects our ability to be leaders in developing new technologies and understanding how to build successful communities and businesses in the 21st century,” said Christopher Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. “Choosing to be dumb about our relationship with the natural world is choosing to be behind the eight ball.”"

She went so far as to take profound personal offense that anyone could read Kelly’s remarks, which bizarrely pinned that conflict on a generic failure to compromise, as a minimization of slavery. He was pristine. His critics were pigs.

“General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isn’t perfect, it doesn’t mean it’s not our history,” she said on Tuesday with an impossibly straight face, utterly ignoring Kelly’s “compromise” comment and his gauzy eulogy of Robert E. Lee.

She added that journalists’ refusal to brush off those tangents was the truly “outrageous and absurd” development. Thus she aced her favorite trick: the moral inversion of the universe.

Other press secretaries demonized the media, but not as ambitiously and artlessly as she. On Wednesday, she was reminded of her recent statement that all leaders have flaws, and she was asked to name one of Trump’s.

“Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis,” she said.

She needs a vocabulary lesson. The bloat of Trump’s ego is a flaw. The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw. Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience — or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment — but it’s not a flaw. It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.

When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster. She chalked up that tweet of his about Mika Brzezinski (“bleeding badly from a face-lift”) to a laudably bold retaliation against a merciless adversary, and she used it as a springboard to swoon over him anew. “I think the American people elected somebody who’s tough, who’s smart and who’s a fighter,” she said. “And that’s Donald Trump.”

She zealously parrots his contention that there’s no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesake’s infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as “pretty standard campaign operating procedure.”

She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos — once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign — was trying to coordinate with Moscow. When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had “nothing to do with the president.”

So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own. She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before. So he was — what — grandfathered in? Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.

Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system “a joke” and “a laughingstock.”

“That’s not what he said,” she shot back — it’s like a reflex with her — and later added, “He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.” Wow. Huge difference. Small problem: Acosta’s description of Trump’s remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.

She’s awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.

Besides, she’s serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. (To listen to her pronounce “priorities” is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)

She’s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump’s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place. Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home. Hence her invocation of religion — she’s the daughter of a rather well-known pastor — when asked during one briefing how she’d explain Trump’s worst behavior to her own children.

“When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model,” she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion. “I point to God. I point to my faith. And that’s where I would tell my kids to look.”

But if they’re to look away from Trump, why does she so willingly look up to him? And how does she square her faith with the purveyance of so much gobbledygook? Maybe she tells herself that there’s no contradiction. That would be her grandest fiction of all."
Hamilton Nolan,DNAinfo and Gothamist weren’t shuttered because of money. They were shut down because they unionized.,2017-11-04T17:29:07Z,the-new-york-times,Opinion | A Billionaire Destroyed His Newsrooms Out of Spite,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/opinion/dnainfo-gothamist-ricketts-union.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/opinion/03nolanWeb/03nolanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Reporters, for all their flaws, tend to understand what’s happening in their own newsrooms. It’s their job to try to see things clearly. Often, what they see in their workplaces is low salaries, inept management and poor communication — ills that plague many workplaces across America. For more than two years now, online media outlets have been unionizing as a way to make our industry better. This week, we learned just how horrifying some rich people find the idea of employees coming together to improve their workplace.

Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, is worth more than $2 billion. He is the owner of DNAinfo, a local news site that covered New York City and Chicago with unparalleled skill, as well as Gothamist, a network of city-oriented websites that DNAinfo bought this year. He is also a major right-wing political donor of rather flexible morality. During the last presidential primaries, Mr. Ricketts spent millions of dollars funding ads that portrayed Donald Trump as an untrustworthy, dangerous misogynist. Once Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Mr. Ricketts spent a million dollars to support him.

One might think that such flexibility would allow Mr. Ricketts to bend but not break when faced with every plutocrat’s worst nightmare: a few dozen modestly paid employees who collectively bargain for better working conditions.

Alas, no.

Six months ago, reporters and editors at DNAinfo-Gothamist announced their intent to join the Writers Guild of America, East. This is the union that my colleagues and I at Gawker Media joined in 2015, and the union that has organized major online media companies like HuffPost, Vice Media, Slate and Thrillist in the past two years. In that short amount of time, unionized “new media” workers have won substantial raises, editorial protections and other improvements that writers at more mature companies take for granted. In defiance of the conventional wisdom that unions are outdated, this young, high-tech industry has been one of the most visible recent successes for organized labor in America.

The DNAinfo-Gothamist announcement sparked a zealous anti-union campaign: Management threatened employees by saying that Joe Ricketts might shut the whole place down if it unionized. Nevertheless, employees last week voted 25-2 in favor of unionization. And on Thursday, Mr. Ricketts abruptly shut the whole place down.

It is worth being clear about exactly what happened here, so that no one gets too smug. DNAinfo was never profitable, but Mr. Ricketts was happy to invest in it for eight years, praising its work all along. Gothamist, on the other hand, was profitable, and a fairly recent addition to the company. One week after the New York team unionized, Mr. Ricketts shut it all down. He did not try to sell the company to someone else. Instead of bargaining with 27 unionized employees in New York City, he chose to lay off 115 people across America. And, as a final thumb in the eye, he initially pulled the entire site’s archives down (they are now back up), so his newly unemployed workers lost access to their published work. Then, presumably, he went to bed in his $29 million apartment."

Cmdr. Scott Carr, a Coast Guard spokesman.

In a Navy video, Ms. Appel said that the pair left Honolulu for an approximately six-month journey on May 3, encountering, on the first night, a fierce storm that lasted for three days.

Weather records, however, contradict that claim. No organized thunderstorms moved through the area at the time, said Charlie Woodrum, a National Weather Service meteorologist based in Honolulu.

There was a small-craft advisory in the area, he said, but it warned only of wind speeds below 35 miles per hour. Ms. Appel said that they had faced a “force 11” storm, which would have carried winds of 64 to 72 miles per hour.

“In May, a force 11 storm is extremely rare,” Mr. Woodrum said.

The women defended their account on Tuesday to The Associated Press, even after it pointed out those inconsistencies.

The A.P. also raised doubts about the women’s claims that their boat would not fit in some Hawaiian harbors, which it noted were frequented by larger vessels.

The women also described a couple of disturbing shark attacks.

At one point, a group of five tiger sharks 20 to 30 feet long attacked their boat at night to teach two younger sharks how to hunt, Ms. Appel said on a call with reporters last week. In an interview with “Inside Edition” last week, she recalled a group of sharks observing her and Ms. Fuiava for a week before attacking.

But there is little credibility to those descriptions, said George Burgess, the director emeritus of the Florida Program for Shark Research at the Florida Museum of Natural History.

“It sounds like something a 4-year-old would tell you,” he said. “No. No, no and no and no. There’s not an iota of accuracy relative to our knowledge of the shark in any of that.”

Tiger sharks are not social, do not teach their young in that way and have never been known to grow that large, he said. When asked, Mr. Burgess added that it was also unlikely that the women were describing another type of shark.

“The only one that fits that pattern was the star of the movie ‘Jaws,’” he said.

Many people familiar with sailing immediately voiced doubts online about the ordeal the women described.

Among them was Linus Wilson, a professor of finance at the University of Louisiana who blogs about sailing and has written books about his experience sailing around various parts of the world.

“It just does not seem believable that if you had a boat with a mast upright, and Ms. Appel said they could sail 4 to 5 knots, that they could not reach land,” he said.

The women debarked the Navy ship that rescued them on Monday in Okinawa, Japan. Attempts to reach the women by telephone on Wednesday either went unanswered or to numbers no longer associated with them."

In May, he fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who later testified that he had refused Mr. Trump’s demands that he pledge loyalty and publicly declare that the president was not personally under investigation. In July, Mr. Trump told The New York Times that he would never have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known that Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from overseeing the investigation.

While his lawyers have for now persuaded Mr. Trump not to publicly attack Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, the president has not ruled out firing him, a scenario that other presidents facing special prosecutors considered virtually unthinkable. Asked on Friday whether he might fire Mr. Sessions if the attorney general does not investigate Democrats, Mr. Trump left open the prospect: “I don’t know,” he said.

The president’s Twitter posts and comments drew rebukes from Democrats and some Republicans. Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who served for six years under President Barack Obama, said Mr. Trump’s comments make the job of law enforcement officials more difficult.

“Combined with his improper attempts to influence Department of Justice actions, this demonstrates that he is a president who is willing to flout those norms that protect the rule of law,” Mr. Holder said in an interview.

Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican who has broken with Mr. Trump, said the Justice Department should be free of political interference.

“President Trump’s pressuring of the Justice Department and F.B.I. to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate and not only undermine our justice system but erode the American people’s confidence in our institutions,” he said.

Some conservatives defended Mr. Trump’s right to exercise oversight of the country’s law enforcement agencies, saying that it would be dangerous to have an attorney general and an F.B.I. director who were not answerable to elected leaders.

“The notion that law enforcement, in particular, is somehow to be insulated from political influences and therefore inevitably insulated from political accountability is a horribly dangerous idea from the standpoint of civil liberty,” said David B. Rivkin Jr., a White House and Justice Department lawyer under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.

However, Mr. Rivkin added, “That doesn’t mean you exercise your authority to direct those things in a crude and obscene fashion. You have to exercise some politesse about it.”

Other presidents have been criticized for political intervention when they spoke out about continuing criminal cases. Peter J. Wallison, who was the White House counsel under Reagan, said his president at times spoke out on cases of interest, including the investigation of Reagan’s onetime adviser Michael K. Deaver.

“I would try to discourage him, for all the good reasons people in the White House are probably trying to discourage Trump, but it was to no avail,” Mr. Wallison said. “Trump is doing the same, except to a greater extent.”

Mr. Wallison noted that Mr. Obama at times commented on investigations, recalling statements denying wrongdoing by the Internal Revenue Service when conservative groups found their tax exemptions targeted for scrutiny. “Presidents say these things because they are human beings and have emotions,” he said. “Nevertheless, there is little evidence that public statements have any effect on outcomes.”

Before Watergate, presidents were less reluctant to intervene in law enforcement. The administrations of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson had the F.B.I. wiretap the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. President Richard M. Nixon had the bureau eavesdrop on the telephone calls of reporters.

But in the past four decades, no president has sought to publicly pressure law enforcement as much as Mr. Trump.

In a barrage of a dozen tweets on Thursday night and early Friday, Mr. Trump railed at law enforcement agencies for not investigating Democrats. He cited Tony Podesta — the brother of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta — who stepped down from his firm this week amid scrutiny of his lobbying business by Mr. Mueller. And he cited a book excerpt by Donna Brazile, the former interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, who wrote that last year’s primaries were tilted by a fund-raising agreement that the committee made with Mrs. Clinton.

“I’m really not involved with the Justice Department,” Mr. Trump told reporters before leaving on a 12-day trip to Asia. “I’d like to let it run itself. But honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats. They should be looking at Podesta and all of that dishonesty. They should be looking at a lot of things. And a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.”

Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump tweeted that Mrs. Clinton “stole the Democratic Primary” from Bernie Sanders and asserted that there was “major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering.”

“At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper,” Mr. Trump wrote.

“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” he also tweeted.

Mr. Trump’s interest in directing law enforcement decisions extends beyond his political opposition but carries its own risk. The president’s support for capital punishment for the New York terrorism suspect, Sayfullo Saipov — “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY,” he tweeted — could pose problems for prosecutors and help defense lawyers who could argue that their client cannot get a fair trial.

Mr. Trump also weighed in again on Friday on the case of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who pleaded guilty to desertion and endangering other troops by walking away from his base in Afghanistan and getting captured by the Taliban. Mr. Trump, who last year called Sergeant Bergdahl a “dirty rotten traitor” who should be executed, expressed outrage when a military judge on Friday gave the sergeant a dishonorable discharge but no jail time.

“The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,” Mr. Trump tweeted.

But Mr. Trump’s own outspokenness may have helped lead to the very result he was condemning. The judge did not explain his reasoning on Friday but last week said he would consider the president’s past comments as evidence for a lighter sentence."

Daniel Stiles, a self-styled ape trafficking detective in Kenya, had been scouring Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp for weeks, looking for pictures of gorillas, chimps or orangutans. He was hoping to chip away at an illicit global trade that has captured or killed tens of thousands of apes and pushed some endangered species to the brink of extinction.

“The way they do business,” he said of ape traffickers, “makes the Mafia look like amateurs.”

After hundreds of searches, Mr. Stiles found an Instagram account offering dozens of rare animals for sale, including baby chimpanzees and orangutans dressed in children’s clothes. He sent an email to an address on the account — “looking for young otans” (the industry standard slang for orangutans) — and several days later received a reply.

“2 babies, 7.5k each. Special introductory price.”

The trafficker identified himself only as Tom and said he was based in Southeast Asia. Mr. Stiles knew what Tom was hoping for: to sell the infant orangutans to a private collector or unscrupulous zoo, where they are often beaten or drugged into submission and used for entertainment like mindlessly banging on drums or boxing one another. Such ape shows are a growing business in Southeast Asia, despite international regulations that prohibit trafficking in endangered apes.

Several weeks later, after a few more rounds of text messages with Tom to firm up the details, Mr. Stiles decided to fly to Bangkok.

“I was way out on a limb,” Mr. Stiles admitted later. But he was eager to bring down Tom, who indicated that he could find orangutans and chimps with only a few days’ notice, the mark of a major dealer."

Torres was the young captain at Atletico Madrid when they went from a second tier club to a La Liga side so when he returned after poor spells at AC Milan and Chelsea in 2015 it was as a hero.

The 33 year old did recapture some of his old form back at the club where he found notoriety and won the Segunda division some 13 years before in the 2001/02 season.

A picture is worth 1000 words, Torres time at Stamford Bridge pretty much summed up. Image: PA



Obviously Torres has never quite hit the heights of his early time in the Premier League with Liverpool but he certainly did better than his later years in England when at Chelsea.

Now though the reintroduction of another Chelsea player to Atleti looks to be speeding the second exit from his childhood club.

According to Spanish outlet Cadena SER Torres has made the decision to leave the Wanda Metropolitano in January with offers from China and MLS reportedly on the table.

Torres bagged eight goals in the league last season but is yet to do so this term. Image: PA



The Spanish striker could have left in the summer but decided to stay put due to the amount of games he had at the end of last season and the club's inability to bring in a replacement.

Atleti are still under a transfer ban so couldn't sign anyone in the summer, the same reason Antoine Griezmann decided to stay, but in January Diego Costa will join.

What a lovely mullett Mr Torres. Image: PA



So far this season Torres has only started once in La Liga this season and the reports suggest that his relationship with Diego Simeone has been damaged by the lack of game time.

It's quite a sad end to the time at a club for such a legend of it but at least he's had the chance to play at the new ground.

Where will Torres end up next?"

At this point in the season we can see some are doing well and some are doing badly but who is doing best?

You probably noticed but this summer a lot of money was spent on transfers both here in the Premier League and abroad throughout Europe, especially in Paris and Barcelona of course.



Teams went out of their way to break their own transfer records on an almost daily basis, especially in the top tier in England, with Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal amongst so those doing so.

We are now long enough into the season to know that the money United spent on Romelu Lukaku, for example, seems a decent investment (despite his current slump) whilst all the money Everton spent seems like it didn't work out too well.

Everton's recruitment policy really didn't work. Image: PA



So who is the signing of the season? Well according to Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher, writing in the Telegraph, it's his beloved Reds' signing of Mohamed Salah:

""Of all the transfers last summer, none has had more impact than Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. Romelu [Lukaku] has also made an immediate impression at Manchester United - who have made a better start to this season - but Salah has only one goal fewer than the centre-forward. It is some goal rate.

""Since Luis Suarez was sold to Barcelona in 2015, the most goals any Liverpool player has scored in a season is 14 (Philippe Coutinho in 2016/17). When I saw Salah score his first for the club at Watford on the opening day, I felt this was a player who would score 15 this season. I underestimated. He is on schedule to get 25.

'The Egyptian is more than a traditional winger. He is a wide striker with the ability to get into goalscoring positions every time he plays.

""There has been plenty of criticism of Liverpool's recruitment in recent years - much of it deserved. But just as with the signing of Sadio Mane in 2016, they have spent very well in bringing Salah back to England after his disappointing spell at Chelsea.

""Paying over £35 million seemed risky, but as was the case with Mane, Salah already looks to be worth more than he cost.""

Salah flopped at Chelsea but his move is a success at Liverpool. Image: PA



Salah continued his excellent form against West Ham on Saturday. He scored twice as the Reds battered the Hammers 4-1.

Leeds United have been in the footballing wilderness for a long time now. It is 13 years since they went from title contenders to being relegated from the top tier of English football and they've been in League One and the Championship since.

For much of last season the beginning of this it has looked like they're finally ready to really give it a go to getting back to the Premier League but a recent dip in form has cast questions over that again.

They went into Saturday's game against Brentford on the back of six defeats in seven games and a 3-1 reverse added to that poor run. To add salt into Samuel Saiz' wounds opponent Yoann Barnet mocked his short stature after a coming together:

And fans were unsurprisingly loving the clash between the 6""2 Barbet and his 5""9 opponent:

It's nearly a month ago that Argentina were one game away from missing out on the World Cup and that would have meant some of the world's best players missing the biggest tournament in football, most notably of course Lionel Messi.

That wasn't to be as Messi's hat-trick in the last group game saw the two time world champions propelled past the play-off spot that looked most likely and straight into the competition in Russia next summer.

When they get there there's every chance they'll actually be one of the favourites, difficult not to be when you've got Messi, and they're likely to be wearing one of our favourite kits when in Russia too.

Admittedly we might be partially to blame for this but in the social media age of football a crisis at a football club can come on very quickly as fans and the media take to Twitter to pile on the pressure.

Bayern Munich were in 'crisis' when they sacked Carlo Ancelotti despite only being a few points off top spot in the Bundesliga and it being so early in the season but the Italian was still removed. Today they upheld their four point lead at the top of the table.

Crisis? What crisis? It looks like life has come pretty easy to Heynckes since stepping out of retirement. Image: PA

The goal actually helped the former Chelsea and Real Madrid winger break two impressive records. He became the highest scoring Dutchman in Bundesliga history and Bayern's top scoring foreign player.

But if they want a bit of a spring in their step ahead of Sunday's game with Chelsea then this should do it.

There's been four pretty bang average years for Manchester United fans since Sir Alex Ferguson decided to call it a day after his 13th Premier League title in 2013 and hang up his chewing.



Of course considering they've twice qualified for the Champions League and won the FA Cup, EFL Cup and Europa League, as well as the Community Shield, in that time it's been a better period than for most teams but it's all relative.

United haven't been anywhere near lifting the Premier League trophy since their legendary manager retired. Image: PA



Their Premier League performances have left much to be desired until this season when the Red Devils look like Manchester City's most likely rivals for the league title.

If United require an extra boost to help them then the return of Zlatan Ibrahimovic should certainly supply it and a video by Marouane Fellaini, posted on his Instagram story, showed the Swede back in training which will certainly suggests a return to playing isn't far away:

Credit: Marouane Fellaini

Ibrahimovic was the club's headline signing upfront last season, finally joining the English league in his mid 30s, and everything went well until he injured his ACL in the Europa League quarter final with Anderlecht.

It led to PSG's all time top scorer being without a contract at the end of the season. But his incredibly quick recovery time made Jose Mourinho decide to sign him up to a new contract before the transfer window closed in August, although as a free agent he could have waited.

Zlatan's goals helped United win the EFL Cup. Image: PA



At one point it looked unlikely that the Swede would be back on the pitch before the new year however it's starting to look like he could have a part to play in the club's busy Christmas period.

If anything will help United to win their next title it's Zlatan's goals, confidence and aura- the comparison with Eric Cantona could be complete."

It is unclear what has caused the altercation, but early reports seem to indicate Evra has aimed a kick at the head of a Marseille fan after a section of visiting l'OM ultras managed to find their way out of the stands and began hurling insults at the former Manchester United left-back, causing tempers to flare between them and some of l'OM's players.

And if you look closely at the first five seconds, you can see 36-year-old Evra showing supreme flexibility to not so slyly throw a kick at one of the fans, nailing them in the head.

Tyson Claxton, who was making his pro debut at Bellator 186, came up against Jonny Bonilla-Bowman on Friday night and within 90 seconds the 24-year-old featherweight landed an incredible flying knee kick. No really, it was something else.

The kick completely KO'd Bowman and as he lay unconscious, Claxton celebrated by climbing on the cage with his arm aloft.

Now this is how you start an MMA career. INSANE!

It took almost two minutes for Jonny Bonilla-Bowman to return to his corner. He also needed help to leave the cage as the flying knee kick took it's toll on the Featherweight.

Claxton, who was a 7-0 (amateur), called out Aaron Pico after announcing that he was moving to Bellator MMA. Pico lost his proffesional debut to Zach Freeman in under 30 seconds, and Claxton called out the 21-year-old on social media:

""One, I got beaters, and he has no chin,"" Claxton told FloCombat earlier this month.

""So if I touch him one time, it's over. It's not a matter of 'if' I touch him. It's 'when' I touch him. That's a fight that I can go out there and try new moves. That's like a little brother fight. I can put my hand on his head and let him swing a couple times and touch him on the chin.""



""Even the guy who beat Pico [Freeman], hell, if you want to throw me on the main card, I will starch his ass in less than 24 seconds. I'll starch the guy that beat Pico. I'll make my pro debut against a guy that's 10-2, 10-3, whatever that guy's record is. I'm not worried about it..""

Introducing Seb Keenan.

Goes without saying, Keenan, 26, is a Football Manager addict. The Oxford-native has played out a staggering 170 (!!) seasons on Football Manager 2010.

Keenan with his certificate.



From managing Bristol City, Queens Park Rangers to Real Madrid and, of course, his beloved Oxford United. Not to mention splitting up with his long-term girlfriend, in real life that is.

But where did the addiction begin?

Well, during university, obviously. Seb started getting hooked on the game while studying at Newcastle Uni.

From seven hour stints during his education to playing after he gets home from work.

And he's thrilled with the achievement who's become a somewhat local hero in his office.

""It feels great. Friends have dubbed it the 'greatest achievement any of us will ever have', screams of 'legend' have been heard as I enter the office, and the response from Oxford United has been particularly pleasing,"" he told Daily Mail.

Keenan on the grind.



""I'm hoping to get a walk-on and half-time announcement, if nothing else. My Dad is very proud, it's probably quite concerning as he's said it's the best thing I am going to be able to achieve.

The only time Seb, who plies his trade as a digital content strategist, was unable to play for a long duration was because of his girlfriend. Though they are no longer together.

""We're not together anymore. Needless to say it's not the most endearing of games to play while in a relationship.

""An Ebbsfleet v Grimsby FA Cup Final in the fictional year of 2120 hardly screams romance.

""She's not aware yet [about the record]. Nowadays I'll play after work for an hour or so and at weekends if I'm not going out.

He recalls his first major breakthrough. Reaching the pinnacle with Huddersfield Town which included playing in the Premier League to winning the Champions League.

""My first major time investment in a team as manager was Huddersfield. I got them into the Premier League and won the Champions League.

""After that I did 25 years with Queen's Park Rangers, had the new Real Madrid Stadium named after me before settling in for a 30-season stint with Barcelona (via an ill-fated mess at Bristol City).

Seb added: ""I've vowed to myself it's the only game of Football Manager I'll ever play. Once I'm finally finished, I couldn't bring myself to start again.""

Seb will go down in Football Manager folklore."

Nilay Patel,The iPhone X is clearly the best iPhone ever made.,2017-10-31T10:00:04Z,the-verge,iPhone X review: face the future,https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6_by8DJegCyx3Ll8eRNzBaOY1Fg=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9597673/jbareham_171031_2099_A_0055.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"After months of hype, endless speculation, and a wave of last-minute rumors about production delays, the iPhone X is finally here. Apple says it’s a complete reimagining of what the iPhone should be, 10 years after the original revolutionized the world. That means some fundamental aspects of the iPhone are totally different here — most notably, the home button and fingerprint sensor are gone, replaced by a new system of navigation gestures and Apple’s new Face ID unlocking system. These are major changes.

New iPhones and major changes usually command a ton of hype, and Apple’s pushing the hype level around the iPhone X even higher than usual, especially given the new thousand-dollar starting price point. For the last few years, we've said some variation of ""it's a new iPhone"" when we’ve reviewed these devices. But Apple wants this to be the beginning of the next 10 years. It wants the iPhone X to be more than just the new iPhone. It wants it to be the beginning of a new generation of iPhones. That's a lot to live up to.

I got a lot of questions about the iPhone X as I wrote this review, and I did my best to answer as many of them as I could. Apple’s asking users to change a decade’s worth of habits, which is a big change. And with big changes come big risks.

Design

At a glance, the iPhone X looks so good one of our video editors kept saying it looked fake. It’s polished and tight and clean — my new favorite Apple thing is that the company managed to move all the regulatory text to software, leaving just the word “iPhone” on the back. The screen is bright and colorful and appears to be laminated tighter than previous iPhones, so it looks like the pixels are right on top. Honestly, it does kind of look like a 3D model instead of an actual working phone.

The iPhone X basically looks like a living 3D render

But it is a real phone, and it’s clear it was just as challenging to actually build as all the rumors suggested. It’s gorgeous, but it’s not flawless. There’s a tiny sharp ridge between the glass back and the chrome frame that I feel every time I pick up the phone. That chrome frame seems destined to get scratched and dinged, as every chrome Apple product tends to do. The camera bump on the back is huge; a larger housing than the iPhone 8 Plus fitted onto a much smaller body and designed to draw attention to itself, especially on my silver review unit. There are definitely going to be people who think it’s ugly. But it’s growing on me.

How this review was made Apple gave most reviewers less than 24 hours with the iPhone X before allowing us to talk about it. The first version of this review was based on a single long, intense day of testing the phone, and we updated it a few days later after we tested performance and battery life, did a camera comparison, and generally lived with the iPhone X in a more realistic way. We also took reader questions and tried to answer as many of them as we could.

There’s no headphone jack, which continues to suck on every phone that omits it, but that’s the price you pay for a bezel-less screen with a notch at the top. Around the sides, you’ll find the volume buttons, the mute switch, and the sleep / wake button. The removal of the home button means there are a few new button combinations to remember: pressing the top volume button and the sleep / wake button together takes a screenshot. Holding the sleep button opens Siri. And you turn the phone off by holding either of the volume buttons and the sleep button for several seconds.

Apple gave us the white and silver model to review, and although Apple says the band on the outside is better than surgical-grade stainless steel, mine already has scratches and dings. So I wouldn’t expect it to remain flawless if you don’t have a case.

And, of course, there’s the notch in the display — what Apple calls the “sensor housing.” It’s ugly, but it tends to fade away after a while in portrait mode. It’s definitely intrusive in landscape, though — it makes landscape in general pretty messy. Less ignorable are the bezels around the sides and bottom of the screen, which are actually quite large. A lot of people I showed the phone to hated them, but I think they make the bright colors of the display pop. It’s a very different design decision than curving the screen to eliminate the bezel entirely, like Samsung does. Instead, Apple’s highlighting what little bezel remains. That amounts to a thick black border all the way around the screen, with that notch set into the top.

I personally think the iPhone 4 is the most beautiful phone of all time, and I’d say the iPhone X is in third place in the iPhone rankings after that phone and the original model. It’s a huge step up from the surfboard design we’ve been living with since the iPhone 6, but it definitely lacks the character of Apple’s finest work. And… it has that notch.

Display

The iPhone X is Apple’s first phone to use an OLED display, after years of Apple LCDs setting the standard for the industry. OLED displays allow for thinner phones, but getting them to be accurate is a challenge: Samsung phones tend to be oversaturated to the point of neon, Google’s Pixel XL 2 has a raft of issues with viewing angles and muted colors, and LG’s new V30 has problems with uneven backlighting.

Apple’s using a 5.8-inch Samsung-manufactured OLED display, which it says it custom designed for the iPhone X. It’s a bigger number than the iPhone 8 Plus’ 5.5-inch display, but it’s a taller, thinner aspect ratio, so it’s actually not as big. Overall, the iPhone X is definitely more of a slightly bigger iPhone 8 than a smaller 8 Plus, and that’s what it feels like in your hand. It’s like when Apple moved from the iPhone 4 to the 5 — the display grew a bit taller. In fact, when you run apps that aren’t optimized for the X, they run with huge software bezels and the whole thing looks exactly like an iPhone 8.

It’s just a terrific display

The display uses a diamond PenTile pixel layout, which means every pixel on the screen shares red, green, and blue subpixels with the pixels around it — unlike previous iPhone LCD screens which have dedicated RGB subpixels in a stripe for every pixel on the screen. A lot of people don’t like PenTile screens and I haven’t liked them in the past either, but you really can’t tell the iPhone X is PenTile with the naked eye. Apple says it’s doing a bunch of custom antialiasing and subpixel rendering to make this display work better than other Samsung PenTile OLEDs, and I think the effort shows.

In any event, the screen is excellent. The iPhone X OLED is bright, sharp, vibrant without verging into parody, and generally a constant pleasure to look at. Side by side with the iPhone 8, the X is noticeably cooler, and a bit softer — which I think makes it slightly easier to look at for long periods. The iPhone X has Apple’s True Tone system to automatically adjust color temperature to the ambient light, but strangely the X was a very different color than the iPhone 8 with True Tone on. I asked Apple about this, and they suggested that the iPhone X’s 10-channel light sensor was more precisely reading the ambient light than the 4-channel unit in the 8. Whatever the case, they were very different.

Apple is very proud that the iPhone X display offers Dolby Vision HDR support, so iTunes movies mastered in HDR play with higher brightness and dynamic range, but honestly, I found it very hard to see the difference when I watched Wonder Woman from iTunes and regular videos on other services. It’s a nice spec line, but I don’t think you’ll notice day-to-day.

The screen isn’t perfect, though: every OLED screen shifts colors off-axis, and the iPhone X is no exception. It definitely gets bluer if you tilt the phone back and forth along either axis, but it’s nothing like, say, the Pixel 2 XL, which tints blue if you just shift the phone in your hand. It’s one of those things that doesn’t leap out at you, but you’ll notice it if you’re looking for it.

A lot of you asked us about burn-in, and I haven’t seen any yet. But it’s early, so I asked Apple about it, and they told me that they’ve also done a ton of work with the screen and in the OS to limit burn-in. Every OLED screen eventually suffers some burn-in though, so we’ll just have to wait and see if the iPhone X really is better than the competition.

Unfortunately, the top of the display is marred by that notch, and until a lot of developers do a lot of work to design around it, it’s going to be hard to get the most out of this screen. I mean that literally: a lot of apps don’t use most of the screen right now.

Apps that haven’t been updated for the iPhone X run in what you might call “software bezel” mode: huge black borders at the top and bottom that make the phone look just like an iPhone 8. And a lot of apps aren’t updated yet: Google Maps and Calendar, HBO Go, the Delta app, Spotify, and more all run with software bezels. Games like CSR Racing and Sonic The Hedgehog looked particularly silly. It’s fine, but it’s ugly, especially since the home bar at the bottom of the screen glows white in this mode.

Some apps almost look right, but then you realize they’re actually just broken

Apps that haven’t been specifically updated for the iPhone X but use Apple’s iOS autolayout system will fill the screen, but wacky things happen: Dark Sky blocks out half the status bar with a hardcoded black bar of its own, Uber puts your account icon over the battery indicator, and Instagram’s volume bar disappears behind the notch entirely. It almost looks right, but then you realize it’s actually just broken.

Apps that have been updated for the iPhone X all have different ways of dealing with the notch that sometimes lead to strange results, especially in apps that play video. YouTube only has two fullscreen zoom options, so playing the Last Jedi trailer resulted in either a small video window surrounded by both letter- and pillar-boxing or a fullscreen view with the notch obscuring the left side of the video. Netflix is slightly better because it mostly plays 16:9 video but you’re still stuck choosing between giant black borders around your video or the notch.

Landscape mode on the iPhone X is generally pretty messy: the notch goes from being a somewhat forgettable element in the top status bar to a giant interruption on the side of the screen, and I haven’t seen any apps really solve for it yet. And the home bar at the bottom of the screen often sits over the top of content, forever reminding you that you can swipe to go home and exit the chaos of landscape mode forever.

I’m sure all of this will get solved over time, but recent history suggests it might take longer than Apple or anyone would like; I still encounter apps that aren’t updated for the larger iPhone 6 screen sizes. 3D Touch has been around for years, but I can’t think of any app that makes particularly good use of it. Apple told me that it’s holding workshops for developers and that the auto layout tools in iOS should make things go much faster than the transition to the iPhone 6 size, but we’ll just have to see how it goes.

Cameras

Now that we have an iPhone X and the Google Pixel 2, we’re going to do a super in-depth camera comparison, but here’s what I can tell you right now: the iPhone X has basically the same cameras as the iPhone 8, and the photos look almost exactly the same. And at the end of the day, I tend to prefer the photos from the Pixel 2 XL.

The back of the iPhone X has two optically stabilized 12-megapixel cameras, one with a f/1.8 wide angle lens and the other with an f/2.4 telephoto. That’s an upgrade from the 8 Plus, which has an f/2.8 non-stabilized telephoto lens. That stabilized tele lens is great; these are probably the best zoom photos I’ve ever taken on a phone, and it’s amazing to shoot 6x zoom video in 4K and have it be sharp and usable. We got a question about slow sync flash, and it’s here, but I don’t think it does very much. Don’t take flash photos if you can help it.

The best zoom photos I’ve ever taken on a phone

The two rear cameras allow for Portrait Mode, which works as well as Portrait Mode on the 8 Plus and also support Portrait Lighting. In another difference from the 8 Plus, the front camera also supports Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting.

Regular photos from the iPhone X are fine — some of them are even great. But I think the Pixel 2 XL takes more evocative photos, with more contrast and better HDR. The iPhone’s dual rear cameras definitely produce better portrait mode photos than the Pixel, and the Pixel definitely produces better portrait photos from the front camera. And I don’t think the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 holds a candle to either of the iPhone X or the Pixel 2: Samsung’s aggressive smoothing makes low-light shots appear better at first, but the iPhone retains more detail.

All in all, these are both excellent cameras, and it really comes down to personal preference and how much you value that zoom lens. I think I prefer the Pixel 2’s cameras, which just seem to produce absolute winners more often. But like I said, we’ll be doing a deep dive video with these cameras soon.

Of course, the main thing the front camera can do is take Animoji, which are Apple’s animated emoji characters. It’s basically built-in machinima, and probably the single best feature on the iPhone X. Most importantly, they just work, and they work incredibly well, tracking your eyes and expressions and capturing your voice in perfect sync with the animation. Animoji work by lighting up the TrueDepth IR camera and dot projector, but it’s not nearly as hardcore as Face ID. There’s no depth map or security stuff; it’s just motion tracking of the muscles on whatever face it see. The only time it doesn’t work great is when you try to wink; Apple told me they know about this and suggested it might get better over time.

Apple’s rolled out a lot of weird additions to iMessage over the years, but Animoji feel much stickier than sending a note with lasers or adding stickers or whatever other gimmicks have been layered on. And while iMessage remains a prime example of platform lock-in, Animoji are notably cross-platform: they work in iMessage, send as videos over MMS, and can be exported as MOV files. Nice. I love them.

Face ID: it works, mostly

The most important feature change on the iPhone X is Face ID, the system that unlocks the phone by recognizing your face. Even that’s an understatement: the entire design and user experience of the iPhone X is built around Face ID. Face ID is what let Apple ditch the home button and Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The Face ID sensor system is housed in the notch — it’s the whole reason the notch exists. The Apple Pay user flow has been reworked around Face ID. Apple’s Animoji animated emojis work using the Face ID sensors.

If Face ID doesn’t work, the entire promise of the iPhone X falls apart.

The good news is that Face ID generally works great. The bad news is that sometimes it doesn’t, and you’ll have to actively move the phone closer to your face to compensate.

You can point a cheap camcorder with night vision at Face ID to see how it works, which I highly recommended doing, because it’s really cool. The iPhone X has a IR light, a dot projector, and an IR camera, all tucked into the notch at the top of screen. (It’s basically a tiny Xbox Kinect.) When you wake up the phone, the IR light goes off, and if the IR camera sees a face, the dot projector flashes a pattern of 30,000 dots. The camera then takes a 2D photo, which gets turned into mathematical depth model, sent to the secure authentication chip, and matched against the stored value. If it matches, you’re in.

Setting up Face ID is ridiculously simple — much simpler than setting up Touch ID on previous iPhones. The phone displays a circular border around your face, and you simply move around until a series of lines around that circle turn green. (Apple suggests you move your nose around in a circle, which is adorable.) Do that twice, and you’re done: Face ID will theoretically get better and better at recognizing you over time, and track slow changes like growing a beard so you don’t have to re-enroll. Drastic changes, like shaving that beard off, might require you to enter your passcode, however.

Face ID should also work through most sunglasses that pass infrared light, although some don’t. And you can definitely make it fail if you put on disguises, but I’d rather have it fail than let someone else through.

In my early tests, Face ID worked well indoors: sitting at my desk, standing in our video studio, and waiting to get coffee. You have to look at it head-on, though: if it’s sitting on your desk you have to pick up the phone and look at it, which is a little annoying if you’re used to just putting your finger on the Touch ID sensor to check a notification.

You also can’t be too casual about it: I had a lot of problems pulling the iPhone X out of my pocket and having it fail to unlock until Apple clarified that Face ID works best at a distance of 25 to 50 centimeters away from your face, or about 10 to 20 inches. That’s closer than I usually hold my phone when I pull it out of my pocket to check something, which means I had to actively think about holding the iPhone X closer to my face than every other phone I’ve ever used. I also apparently hold the phone pretty close to my face when I wake up in the morning — closer than the recommended 10-inch minimum — and don’t have my glasses on, so I had to adjust that muscle memory as well. “You’re holding it wrong” is a joke until it isn’t, and you can definitely hold the iPhone X wrong.

You can definitely hold the iPhone X wrong

That’s a small problem, though, and I think it’ll be easy to get used to. The other problem is actually much more interesting: almost all of the early questions about Face ID centered around how it would work in the dark, but it turns out that was exactly backwards. Face ID works great in the dark, because that IR projector is basically a flashlight, and flashlights make it easy to see in the dark. But go outside in bright sunlight, which contains a lot of infrared light, or under crappy florescent lights, which interfere with IR, and Face ID starts to get a little inconsistent.

I took a walk outside our NYC office in bright sunlight, and Face ID definitely had issues recognizing my face consistently while I was moving until I went into shade or brought the phone much closer to my face than usual. I also went to the deli across the street, which has a wide variety of lights inside, including a bunch of overhead florescent strips, and Face ID also got significantly more inconsistent.

You’ll just have to hold the phone closer in some lighting to make Face ID work

I asked Apple about this, and it seems like you’ll just have to hold the iPhone X closer to your face in certain lighting conditions. It never just totally failed for me — it just didn’t work as well from farther away when I was walking around outside or in sunlight. And you can’t unlock it in landscape mode or if your face is upside down; you’ll just have to enter your passcode. You also have to look at it pretty directly, which means unlocking while the phone is sitting on a table is out unless you look over the phone. And if you’re the sort of person who discreetly checks their notifications while talking to people, well, get used to making it very obvious that you’re looking at your phone, because notifications don’t fully display until the phone unlocks

A lot of people asked me about Face ID privacy issues, but I don’t think there’s much to be worried about. Face ID never really takes or stores a photo of your face — the regular front camera is only used during setup so you can see yourself. The IR photo is just used to generate the depth map that’s compared to the stored value. And nothing ever gets sent to Apple — it’s just a bunch of numbers stored in the secure part of the processor. Obviously every system can be hacked, but you shouldn’t worry about a bunch of photos of your face being sent to iCloud or whatever. It’s just not how the thing is designed. If you weren’t worried about Touch ID, you probably shouldn’t worry about Face ID.

As for speed, well, it varies. Most of the time, in normal lighting conditions, it’s so fast that it’s almost like not having a passcode on your phone. You pick it up, swipe up, and you’re in — just like the old swipe to unlock days. But other times, it takes a second. Again, I think that’s mostly under strange lighting conditions.

It’s basically the same amount of irritation as a fingerprint scanner: sometimes your fingers are wet and you have enter the passcode, and sometimes the light’s weird and you have to move the phone closer to your face and wait a second.

Face ID is a fine replacement for Touch ID

You also use Face ID for Apple Pay, and it’s pretty easy: you double click the side button, authenticate, and then hold the phone to the reader. It actually makes a little more sense to me than Touch ID, because you’re actively turning Apple Pay on, instead of just waving your phone at the card reader and hoping it works. It’s nice.

All in all, Face ID is a fine replacement for Touch ID. It’s not perfect, but it’s perfectly workable. But you will definitely run into situations where you have to adjust where you’re holding the phone or try it again a few times. Recent Apple products have tended to demand people adapt to them instead of being adapted to people, and it was hard not to think about that as I stood in the sunlight, waving a thousand-dollar phone ever closer to my face.

Software

There’s a lot of new hardware in the iPhone X, but it’s still running iOS 11 — albeit with some tweaks to navigation to accommodate the lack of a home button. Apple told me they didn’t want to make any drastic changes to the main iOS experience because they thought the removal of the home button was enough — you have to learn a whole bunch of new gestures to navigate this phone.

You swipe up from the bottom to go home, swipe down from the right to open Control Center, and swipe down from the left to open the notifications pane. That pane also has buttons for the flashlight and camera; in a twist, they require 3D Touch to work, so they feel like real buttons. It’s neat, but also breaks the 3D Touch paradigm — it’s the only place the entire system where 3D Touch acts like a left click instead of a right click. It’s emblematic of how generally fuzzy iOS has become with basic interface concepts.

If you want to switch apps, you either swipe along the bottom of the screen or swipe up and hold — you’ll get a little haptic bump and the app switcher will show up. It took a minute to figure out how to do that move consistently. It took me a little longer to figure out how to consistently use Reachability.

You can only see battery percentage in Control Center

Actually, lots of people asked about Reachability, which is the iOS feature that brings the top of the screen down to make one handed usage easier. I use it all the time on my Plus, and it’s still here -— only now you swipe down about halfway up the icon dock from the home indicator. I couldn’t get this work at all until something clicked and I figured it out, but I’m still not perfect at it. Once you’ve brought the UI down, you can swipe on either top corner to open Notification Center or the Control Center. You’ll be pulling down Control Center a lot, since it’s the only way to see battery percentage and Bluetooth status on the iPhone X — the notch means there’s not enough room to put that info in the menu bar full time. I check battery percentage all the time, so this felt like a step back.

I asked Apple why Notification Center is a sheet and Control Center is an overlay, and the company told me that it’s “philosophical” — Control Center is supposed to be an always-there widget, and Notification Center is supposed to be another screen that slides down. Whatever it is, I think it looks really messy to have two different interface patterns for the same action at the top of the screen.

If you spend a lot of time in unoptimized apps, it’s a lot like an iPhone 8

And… those are basically the changes to iOS 11 on the iPhone X, apart from the various notch-related kerfuffles. If you’ve been using iOS for a while and iOS 11 for the past month, nothing here will surprise you. If you spend a lot of time in unoptimized apps for work like Google Docs and Trello like I do, it’s a lot like using an iPhone 8. I really want Apple to make notifications more powerful. I would love to see some more customizability on the home screen, and I would love to be able to set new default apps for mail and web browsing. Siri is still Siri. I’d also love for the overall design to be more fun — years after iOS 7, everything still feels pretty stark and brutal, compared to the increasingly whimsical version of Android Google’s shipping on the Pixel.

If you’re buying an iPhone X expecting a radical change to your iPhone experience, well, you probably won’t get it. Unless you really hate unlocking your phone.

Battery

Apple says the iPhone X should get two hours more battery life than the iPhone 7, and while it’s been pretty hard to test this week while we’ve been running the screen and cameras full tilt for this review, I’ve been pretty impressed. OLED screen generally draw less power than LCDs, and I got great battery life with the iPhone 8, which shares most of the same components as the X. So I would expect to go close to full days with the X.

The iPhone X is clearly the best iPhone ever made. It’s thin, it’s powerful, it has ambitious ideas about what cameras on phones can be used for, and it pushes the design language of phones into a strange new place. It is a huge step forward in terms of phone hardware, and it has the notch to show for it. If you’re one of the many people who preordered this thing, I think you’ll be happy, although you’ll be going on the journey of figuring out when and how Face ID works best with everyone else.

It’s a new iPhone

But if you didn’t preorder, I suspect you might not feel that left out for a while. The iPhone X might be a huge step forward in terms of hardware, but iOS 11 runs the same on lots of other iPhones, and you won’t be missing out on anything except Animoji. Face ID works extremely well, although you should expect to have to move the phone closer to your face from time to time. And until your favorite apps are updated, you won’t be able to make use of that entire beautiful display.

All that adds up to the thing you already know: the iPhone X is a very expensive iPhone. For a lot of people, it’ll be worth it. For a lot of people, it’ll seem ridiculous. But fundamentally, it’s a new iPhone, and that means you probably already know if you want to spend a thousand dollars on one. If you’re a huge iPhone fan and you have the money, you’ll love it. It’s a really nice phone. But if you have any doubts at all, stick with an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. You’ll get most of the same features, and you’ll wait out app developers figuring out how to use this new screen. Eventually every iPhone will look like the iPhone X, after all. The rest of us will just be using Animoji in the meantime."

The companies jointly announced today that they have ended negotiations after they were “unable to find mutually agreeable terms.”

In its announcement, Sprint’s President and CEO Marcelo Claure says that while they recognized the potential value in merging, “we have agreed that it is best to move forward on our own.” T-Mobile’s President and CEO John Legere outlined that any merger would have to bring in long-term value to his shareholders.

There’s been widespread speculation for months that the two companies would merge to challenge their larger rivals, AT&T and Verizon. In May, Sprint and T-Mobile resumed preliminary and informal talks about a merger – a discussion which dates all the back to 2014 when Sprint began its pursuit to buy T-Mobile. The rumors renewed this September when both sides were reportedly close to reaching tentative terms. Those talks apparently collapsed last week as Sprint reportedly called them off, only to have T-Mobile make a revised offer, which Sprint has apparently rejected.

The companies have let open the possibility of other mergers, however: Claure noted that he believes that “significant opportunities exist to establish strong partnerships across multiple industries.” Earlier this summer, The Wall Street Journal reported that Sprint proposed a merger with Charter."
Jacob Kastrenakes,"It feels so hard not to love Stranger Things. I get that some people see too many bits and pieces of other shows and movies they love inside of it, but I think the reason the series works so well...",2017-11-04T16:00:02Z,the-verge,"New trailers: The Last Jedi, The Disaster Artist, and more",https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/4/16604796/new-trailers-star-wars-last-jedi-ghost-stories-disaster-artist-watch,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gFwB1_qEun5Y7b_FyRGasajgVxk=/64x0:1086x535/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9604779/image1.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"It feels so hard not to love Stranger Things. I get that some people see too many bits and pieces of other shows and movies they love inside of it, but I think the reason the series works so well is that it treats all of those elements with the perfect balance of seriousness and whimsy. If someone's a ridiculous conspiracy theorist, they get played as wacky and out there, but they also get to be surprisingly prescient, as you'd expect in a world where the government is hiding a portal into another dimension.

What I think is especially wonderful is how you can watch a nine-hour adventure starring a bunch of middle school students and so often forget that you're watching a story about children. The Stranger Things kids get taken seriously and are never played off as being silly and immature. And in fact, the naiveté and creativity that comes along with being children continually serves them well. Referencing a Dungeons & Dragons manual really shouldn't help one defeat any real-world problem; but here, it always lends some wisdom that adults never would have thought to look for.

At the same time, I think this season may have done an even better job of exploring the challenges of growing up — romantic interests, friends growing apart, deciding who you want to be and model yourself after. There's been a lot of debate over whether all of these things work as well as they're intended to, and sure, not everything is perfect. But I enjoyed watching season two every bit as much as season one. There really isn't anything else quite as fun on TV.

Check out nine trailers from this week below.

Ghost Stories

This is pretty neat. Ghost Stories is a single film made up of three separate ghost stories, all held together by a single framing story. To tease the film, IFC put out three separate trailers this week, each focusing on one of the movie's three stories. The first is above, but you can watch the others here and here. There's no release date just yet. It's planned for some time in 2018.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi

After the last Star Wars trailer came out, I decided not to watch any more Star Wars trailers — so I haven't actually watched this one. I might even recommend you not watch this one too if you're already sold on the movie. But if you really can't wait, it sounds like there are some real fan-pleasing shots in this short teaser. The movie comes out in just over a month, on December 15th.

Slice

Okay, normally I won’t post teasers if they don't actually show the movie they're about, but this one earns it. Slice is by the director behind the wonderful music video for Donnie Trumpet & the Social Experiment's equally wonderful ""Sunday Candy,"" and it also stars Chance the Rapper. Not only that, but this teaser is one big throwback to the game Line Rider, which I now have a weird nostalgia for even though I haven't thought about it in a decade. (It still exists!) The teaser even recreates a popular Line Rider video, with the same music and much of the same track. Does this have anything to do with the movie? I have no idea, and honestly, I don't care. I love it. Slice comes out sometime next year.

I, Tonya

After getting a short teaser the other week, we now have a full trailer for I, Tonya, the surprisingly energetic, vulgar, and violent film about former Olympic figure skating sensation Tonya Harding, whose involvement in an attack on another skater got her banned for life from the US Figure Skating Association. The movie looks like a ton of fun and a far from typical biopic. It comes out sometime this winter.

The Disaster Artist

There have been a bunch of trailers for this already, but watching James Franco pretend to be Tommy Wiseau is just too much fun to ignore. The Disaster Artist comes out December 8th.

In the Fade

In the Fade is Germany's tragically relevant submission for this year's foreign language Oscar. It's a thriller about a woman trying to get revenge after neo-Nazis kill her husband. Reviews have been mixed so far, but Diane Kruger won best actress at Cannes this year for her performance. The film comes to the US on December 27th.

Counterpart

Starz has a new sci-fi series coming up that has J.K. Simmons playing two roles — alternate versions of the same character from connected worlds. The premise seems to have something to do with the Cold War, government secrets, and messing with a near-parallel world. I don't think it's all supposed to be totally clear from this trailer, but it sounds like an interesting setup. The series starts January 21st.

Voyeur

Well this is... something. This documentary goes behind the scenes with the subject and writer of “The Voyeur's Motel,” Gay Talese's scandalous 2016 New Yorker piece about a motel owner who spied on his customers for decades. There was a lot of backlash after the piece's publication, and Talese even disavowed it (briefly) after discovering some discrepancies in the motel owner's accounts. This documentary seems to retell the story and follow along with the ensuing drama. It comes out December 1st.

Pottersville

Microsoft’s boot-up animation is bright, loud, and full of surround sound bass, perfectly epitomizing the bombastic nature of the company’s “true 4K” gaming message. Microsoft’s Xbox One X is the world’s most powerful console, and the company is beating its chest about its 4K capabilities.

Microsoft has a lot of reasons it needs to be this bold. Sony is winning this console war, backed by massive exclusive titles like The Last of Us, Uncharted 4, and Horizon Zero Dawn. The original Xbox One had a hard time competing with Sony’s PlayStation 4, thanks initially to lower specifications and a bundled Kinect that led to a $100 price gap. Microsoft is answering those old complaints with the new Xbox One X. It’s a smaller, sleeker, faster console than the original, and it’s easily more capable than the PS4 or PS4 Pro (Sony’s 4K console) in terms of raw power.

While the power inside is unquestionable, Microsoft’s focus on hardware specs isn’t matched with launch titles that really show off 4K gaming. Forza Motorsport 7 debuted last month, so the Xbox One X isn’t launching with any exclusive AAA games. At $499, you’re really paying for the pure hardware here, and you’ll need a 4K TV to get the best benefits. If you’re an original Xbox One owner, you’re going to be really pleased with the improvements. For everyone else, it’s going to depend on what games you play. Hardware only goes so far.

The hardware

Let’s start with the basics. I’m really impressed and surprised at how much power Microsoft has managed to squeeze into the Xbox One X’s small case. While the original Xbox One was a big, black box about the size of an old-school VCR, the Xbox One X matches the impressive design of the Xbox One S. It’s actually smaller than the S in terms of volume, but I did notice if you stack them, then the X is larger in some dimensions. Either way, it’s small enough to fit in a backpack, but it’s rather dense so it feels heavier than the One S.

The Xbox One X design is very similar to the S

The Xbox One X has the same inputs and ports as the S. There’s HDMI-in if you want to connect up a TV set-top box, two USBs at the rear and one at the front, and an Ethernet port. Microsoft ditched the external power supply from the original Xbox One, and it’s all integrated in and dual voltage. All in all, it’s very similar to the Xbox One S from the outside and still needs a USB adaptor for the Kinect.

The real power can be found inside. Microsoft is using a 2.3GHz 8-core AMD Jaguar processor, 12GB of RAM, and a six-teraflop AMD Radeon GPU. That’s nearly two teraflops more than the PS4 Pro, a faster CPU, and 3GB more of overall RAM. The Xbox One X comfortably outperforms the PS4 Pro. On hardware alone, it’s smaller, more powerful, and even includes a 4K Blu-ray player over its PS4 Pro rival.

All of that power means you need a good cooling system and fans to match. During my own testing, I haven’t noticed any huge issues here. The fans are noticeable (like a gaming PC) at times when you’re not even pushing the console, and they’re definitely louder than the Xbox One S. The back of the One X unit does get rather hot, and I’d recommend not keeping this locked away in a cupboard. I never had issues with it stacked inside an open shelving unit, though.

4K gaming

The real promise of the Xbox One X is “true 4K” gaming. Most games made for the Xbox One are designed for 1080p TVs, which have a quarter of the pixels found on a new 4K TV. The Xbox One X is more than four times faster than the original Xbox One, so it’s capable of 4K gaming. While it’s not as powerful as the latest gaming PCs, the benefits are really going to depend on what game you’re playing. Microsoft is promising more than 150 “enhanced” games for the Xbox One X, but that doesn’t always mean they will be 4K. Some enhancements could include better frame rates instead of 4K resolution, or HDR capability. Other enhancements might include 4K, HDR, and better frame rates. It’s up to game developers to decide, and there’s not a clear pattern yet.

I enjoy PC games for the smooth frame rates, and I find it nauseating jumping back to the same game running at 30fps on a console. I spent some time playing Gears of War 4 with its new up-to-60fps “performance mode.” Although it’s an old game at this point, it’s a good example of how the Xbox One X can have 4K modes or performance-focused modes. The 4K mode, coupled with HDR, looks great, but the performance mode running at 60fps feels even better without the 4K resolution boost. Rise of the Tomb Raider also has similar options, and it’s a balance that game developers should really offer gamers.

Some games will offer 4K, HDR, and 60fps

Some games like Forza Motorsport 7 will offer the best of all worlds: 4K, HDR, and 60fps. This is the peak of what the Xbox One X offers, but Microsoft didn’t make the Forza 7 update available in time for review. I’ve played demo versions over the past few weeks at Xbox events and it looks beautiful, but sometimes it’s hard to really notice the difference over what I have with my Xbox One S. The S runs Forza 7 at 60fps with HDR, so you'd have to really care about the resolution upgrade and the better textures and shadows.

Other titles like Titanfall 2 also boost the resolution up to 4K, but dynamically alter it based on GPU load to keep smooth gameplay at 60fps. I could argue about all the various tricks that developers will use to hit 4K gaming, whether it’s checkerboarding or dynamic resolution, but none of this really matters unless you’re a pixel nerd. It’s the gameplay that matters, and once you’ve tried a game in 60fps it’s hard to step back to 30fps, regardless of the resolution and textures.

One of the biggest improvements I noticed when an Enhanced for Xbox One X update arrived was Assassin's Creed Origins. It looks stunning on the Xbox One X, with a 4K resolution and HDR support. It’s way less blurry than on my Xbox One S, and I’d say it’s closer to looking like it does on my PC thanks to the obvious improvements in textures. On my LG OLED with HDR enabled it looks gorgeous and runs really well. I hope this is a shining example of what’s to come from developers on newer games.

Not all enhancements are available just yet

It’s a mixture right now, and not all developers have made their enhancements available to test. I spent the beginning of the week playing Super Lucky’s Tale – a 3D platformer originally released in VR for the Oculus Rift – as no other games I owned had updates ready. It’s a good looking game, but it doesn’t really push what the Xbox One X can do.

You don’t necessarily need a 4K TV to get some of the console’s benefits. If you happen to have a 1440p gaming monitor laying around then the Xbox One X will soon support it. I wasn’t able to test this as Microsoft isn’t supporting 1440p just yet, but it won’t just be outputting like the PS4 Pro at 1080p and upscaling. Likewise, 1080p TVs will see benefits to pure performance. I played Destiny 2 on the Xbox One X and it felt a lot smoother than on my Xbox One S. It’s still locked to 30fps, but some of the frame rate dips I’d experienced during Destiny’s raid or public events were gone. Some games without One X-specific updates, like Destiny 2 at this point, will still see performance improvements and better texture filtering on the One X.

My biggest issue with the Xbox One X is a lack of stunning 4K games to really show why this is worth $499. Assassin's Creed Origins is the best I tried, but it’s not exclusive to the Xbox One X. Microsoft doesn’t have a single launch exclusive for this console, and while enhancements to old games are great, I often found it hard to even notice big differences because I don’t think some of these games were designed with 4K textures in mind. There’s no big blockbuster game I can only play on the Xbox One X right now, and Microsoft isn’t offering up much hope for the future, either.

Crackdown 3 was supposed to launch in time for the Xbox One X, but it’s delayed until spring next year. Scalebound, Fable Legends, and Ion were outright canceled, and Microsoft has shut down Project Spark. Even PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, Microsoft’s “console launch exclusive,” won’t be available until December 12th.

Sony has God of War, Spider-Man, Death Stranding, The Last of Us Part II, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Detroit all on the way. Whether these are all native 4K or not, these are huge games and they make Microsoft’s lineup look paltry by comparison.

Entertainment

Aside from games, the Xbox One X is also an entertainment center of sorts. The 4K Blu-ray drive will bring you crisp movies with Dolby Atmos and HDR 10 (but no Dolby Vision) support, and it’s an addition the PS4 Pro lacks. Oddly, Microsoft doesn’t offer 4K movies or TV shows in its own store outside the US. You’ll need to mostly rely on a Netflix or Amazon Video subscription to get streaming 4K movies or TV shows, and even the YouTube app doesn’t support 4K. It’s an odd omission given Microsoft’s 4K focus.

Microsoft has a great range of entertainment apps

Microsoft does have some good third-party apps for entertainment, including Plex, Spotify, Amazon Video, Netflix, HBO Go, and Hulu Plus. You can also use the HDMI-in port to connect up a Chromecast, or watch TV through your cable set-top box with the Xbox’s OneGuide. Microsoft has stepped back from some of its entertainment and TV commitments, but the Xbox One X is still a solid box to watch content alongside playing games.

One thing to note: buy an external drive for the Xbox One X. I ran out of space on the 1TB drive of the Xbox One X with around 14 games installed and 20 apps. Most Xbox One games are around 40GB or 50GB in size, but I’ve noticed the Enhanced for Xbox One X games are significantly bigger. Gears of War 4 and Halo 5 are at least 100GB, and Titanfall 2 is around 70GB. If you don’t have a particularly fast internet connection you’ll also be waiting hours to download these games.

I’ve not had enough time to test all of the enhancements to the Xbox One X games, simply because they haven’t gone live at the time of this review. That said, the ones I’ve experienced haven’t blown me away enough to warrant the upgrade over my Xbox One S. I switched back to the One S, and I did notice that certain games weren’t as smooth and certainly didn’t look as good, but I soon adjusted.

Likewise, when I returned to the Xbox One X it felt a lot like my Xbox One S. The jump from 1080p to 4K isn’t as profound as SD to HD, and I found it hard to always notice the difference at the distance from my TV. Maybe that will change once more enhanced games are available, but I don’t think most people will be able to notice a big difference just yet. Games will need to be tweaked and fully optimized for the Xbox One X hardware, and you already get the benefits of HDR on the Xbox One S.

That said, the X does offer the best graphics currently possible on a console. If you don’t care about Sony’s exclusives then the Xbox One X will be the best console to play all the cross-platform games coming out. If you already have a large stack of Xbox One games and you’re using the original console, this is going to be a nice upgrade if you own a 4K TV.

For anyone else, this probably isn’t the console for you. Sony really has some impressive exclusives on the way, and it’s hard for Microsoft to counter this despite its great job on the hardware. Microsoft promised the best hardware, and it delivered — but that’s nothing without games."
Dieter Bohn and Vlad Savov,Ping / Counterping: Extreme First World Problems edition,2017-11-04T14:00:04Z,the-verge,"How big of a problem is the Pixel 2 XL's screen, really?",https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/4/16605144/pixel-2-xl-screen-oled-color-shift-issues-ping-counterping,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k2PYGo1-_seOWumMhX8QItn45nI=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9474573/jbareham_171014_2050_0414.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Ping / Counterping is a special feature where editors of The Verge debate issues from the world of technology head-to-head, no holds barred. Vlad Savov and Dieter Bohn are bringing it back after a very long hiatus to debate whether the screen on the Pixel 2 XL is a deal breaker.

I reviewed the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL a couple of weeks ago. After that review was published, we discovered that the 2 XL exhibits more image retention than you'd expect on a flagship (or really any) phone, especially one so early in its lifecycle. Google quickly moved to address the issue as best it could, saying it's confident there's no real burn-in, but also promising software updates to mitigate against it going forward. The company is also extending the warranty to two years.

Ever since, I've been continuing to test both the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL. In fact, I purchased both phones so I could do longer-term testing on them. Yes, I am a maniac, but this is also my job. I've also preordered an iPhone X, because I am an equal opportunity maniac. Anyway, I have both Pixel 2 phones available to me at a whim now. And for the past week, my whim has been thus: I have been picking up, using, and enjoying the Pixel 2 XL much more often — despite the screen troubles.

I will now pause and let my esteemed colleague, Vlad Savov, react to this startling information.

Vlad Savov

For me, the Pixel 2 XL represents a moment of personal (melo)drama. All throughout this year, I knew exactly what was going to happen: LG would build up my expectations only to let them down, Sony would announce a groundbreaking phone in winter that would be entirely conventional by the time it was released in the summer, and Samsung would be that little bit too staid and consistent in its ways to capture my passions.

It was Google I was waiting on; every other phone, even the brilliant HTC U11, was a fling. The true successor to my Google Pixel passions was going to be the Google Pixel 2. And the Pixel 2 XL looked like something close to perfection: slim bezels, big battery, solid design, and an even better HDR+ camera. I was ready to commit.

I’ve ended up a very satisfied Google Pixel 2 user

What I can’t forgive Google for is the way it screwed up one of the things we’d long ago figured out. Good phone displays have been around for way too many years for us to accept substandard ones from Google. And especially not from the otherwise close-to-perfect Pixel 2 XL. The display is too essential, too central to everything we do with a phone for it to be considered an acceptable compromise.

Maybe I can live with shorter battery life. Maybe I can tolerate big bezels for another year. But a bad screen? No chance. And that’s why I’ve ended up a very satisfied Google Pixel 2 user, even though I really would have loved to have been a delighted Pixel 2 XL owner. As to Dieter, I think he’s investing his hopes in Google’s promised software fixes rather than looking at things objectively.

Dieter Bohn

You should never buy a phone today based on the promise of a software tomorrow. And make no mistake: I do not believe that Google’s software changes are going to alter the experience of this screen. Google is promising to do just a few things, and none of them are going to be major changes.

It’s going to alter the way the nav buttons and other persistent elements are lit up, so they’re less likely to cause burn-in over time. That may reduce image retention, but I doubt it. It’s also going to give users the option to turn off color management and get more vibrant, less-accurate colors if they so choose.

Never buy a phone today based on the promise of a software update tomorrow

That’s great, but it won’t stop the blue shift or the grain on the physical screen itself. But for me, in both of those cases, I’m not righteously angry about it. I’m not going to reject this screen out of a principle that “Flagship, expensive phones shouldn’t have sub-par screens.” Standing on principle is less important to me than having a phone that matches my needs.

Another thing: this screen does have redeeming qualities. Because it's OLED, the blacks are fully black and so you can get some very extreme contrast. I especially like reading on the Kindle app at night with Night Light turned on — the only pixels lit up are the words and they're dim enough to not keep me awake. I don’t feel bereft or annoyed every time I look at the screen. It's also, you know, big.

I’m going to stick with the Pixel 2 instead of another Android phone because I think the camera is almost surely the best of this generation. Also because Google’s version of Android is flatly superior to everything else out there. As for which Pixel 2, it’s about trade-offs. For me, battery life and a large screen for my big, dumb eyes is more important than color accuracy. Besides, let’s face it, the smaller Pixel 2 avoids the sin of color shift but is guilty of another sin: being tiny and cramped.

Vlad Savov

It’s good that you brought up the specifics of the Pixel 2 XL’s screen issues, Dieter, and good that you’re fully aware of them in making your choice. A big reason for why I’ve been so vociferous in my outrage about the 2 XL is that its problems are not immediately noticeable — many people will walk into a Verizon store, look at the thin bezels and high DxOMark rating of the 6-inch Googlephone, and wind up convinced that they’re getting a great product. I think they’re getting, say, 90 percent of a great product.

I’m right there with you on the excellence of Google’s own Android software, the importance of a solid battery, and the unequaled supremacy of Google’s Pixel cameras. The difference between us is that I do care about principle. I care that the way I spend my money signals something to tech companies and mobile carriers. If I’m purchasing products with fundamental flaws — whether they be iffy displays or absent headphone jacks — I’m saying that those flaws aren’t meaningfully problematic to me. If I want the future of mobile tech to be defined by amazing audio and video, that’s the guiding light that should be directing my purchases today.

Here’s my question: have you tried using the Pixel 2 with all the display settings reduced to a smaller size? It’s a little bit of a throwback to the BlackBerry days of yore, but it has been a good solution for me, fitting plenty of readable content on the screen even without fancy new screen tech.

Another thing that’s often missed with smaller phones: they make for much more discreet cameras when you’re out and about. I was a photo-happy tourist in Milan this past weekend, and I could shoot my snaps without feeling like everyone can see my enormous screen, or like I’m getting in people’s way. The Pixel 2 is simply more inconspicuous.

Dieter Bohn

I have tried the Pixel 2 with different settings, fiddling with both the “Display size” and “Font size” settings. Sadly, making things smaller isn’t really an option for me anymore. I use it on the go too often to read tiny type while standing on a subway car, and I’m old enough that squinting isn’t an option.

You are correct that it’s important to clearly communicate to as many people as possible that the first impression of the Pixel 2 XL screen isn’t going to accurate convey the experience over time. This is a display that is subtly worse than other phone displays in ways many will only unconsciously notice, as you pointed out here. But if you’re conscious of those issues going in, I think it’s a totally defensible purchase.

As for a less conspicuous camera, well, if I want something like that, maybe I’ll pick up a Google Clips camera ;).

I take your point about voting with dollars — and the Pixel 2 XL certainly represents a lot of dollars. But somehow I doubt that my purchase is going to move the needle. On the other hand, I guess I’m doing a bit of grandstanding myself with the Pixel 2. Samsung, OnePlus, and Essential have all figured out how to reduce bezels on smaller phones, so it’s just a bummer to me that Google couldn’t figure it out.

Honestly, I think some of the angst we’re all feeling right now is that smartphones are better than they have ever been. In many ways, we can see clearly that it is 100 percent possible to build the Platonic Ideal Smartphone all of us wanted a couple years ago. Yet, it is almost obstinately not happening:

iPhone 8: bezels

iPhone 8 Plus: surfboard

Pixel 2: bezels

Pixel 2 XL: screen

Essential: camera

Samsung: Bixby

LG: screen

iPhone X: notch — Dieter Bohn (@backlon) October 24, 2017

In the course of our work, we often pick up and use multiple devices. The one I personally keep picking up and sighing over is the Essential Phone. It forces a different set of trade-offs — I can’t handle the camera — but the same basic feeling: we know that a nearly perfect phone could be made, at least by the standards we’ve been living with the past few years.

Just once, before AR and who-knows-what-else changes the rules and expectations again, I’d like somebody to make that idealized phone. Maybe it’s the iPhone X.

Vlad Savov

The impossibility of the ideal phone is driven by our constantly rising standards of expectation. I’ve accused the Pixel 2 XL of looking like it has an OLED screen from the year 2012, and that illustrates the point: even with its visual faults, this phone would have been considered advanced alien tech five years ago. Everything is getting better. And if we all thought in absolute rather than relative ways, we’d be delighted about it.

Phones are interesting because we’re still figuring out the hows, whats, and whys of building and using them.

But there’s an inevitable urge to try and optimize a purchase as costly as a smartphone and to seek out the definitive best. Which phone gets me the most for my hard-earned money? I no longer think there is a clear answer to that question for the majority of people. I know some members of my family who can’t live without Apple Maps, for instance, others who dwell entirely within Facebook’s app ecosystem, and others still who are total Google services addicts. Yes, they all use the camera, but do they care about the Pixel’s imaging advantages over something else that’s good, such as a Samsung Galaxy or an iPhone? How much does that aspect matter to them?

You and I provide ample evidence to show the uneven priorities people place on device characteristics. I have a checklist that goes camera, display, battery life, and until I’m satisfied that all three meet a certain standard, nothing else matters about a phone. I can totally see a world in which battery life is more important, as it is for you, and things like one-handed size can totally trump all else. It’s just that with the Pixel 2 XL we do actually have the option to get the majority of its strengths without the one major weakness, and that’s why I keep advocating in favor of the Pixel 2.

More broadly speaking, I’m unworried that the ideal smartphone will ever come into being — though I may be biased by the fact that we’d need to find new jobs if phones were ever perfected. Nobody cares to read about microwave ovens these days, and that’s because they represent a fixed problem. Phones are interesting because we’re still figuring out the hows, whats, and whys of building and using them.

Dieter Bohn

Hard agree. Also, as long as we're on the topic of ""figuring out the hows,"" can somebody explain to me how it is that Google keeps shipping phones that should have been rejected by quality control before they got out the factory door? It's mystifying.

I blame Plato, tbh

I still can't get over the feeling that the choices this year feel a little more stark than usual. I know there will never be a perfect phone, but I also know that it used to be a little easier to get a phone that hit high marks in all the important categories instead of just most of them. Like I said before, we can visualize what we want and know it could have been made, but damned reality keeps getting in the way. I blame Plato, tbh.

Well, now that we've fully completed this round of Ping / Counterping, First World Problems edition, it's time to move on to the next extremely privileged thing to gripe about: USB-C is still a mess and it's Apple and Google's fault for assuming the ecosystem would figure it out.

Vlad Savov

No argument here."
Loren Grush,Proxima Centauri is a complex place,2017-11-04T17:00:01Z,the-verge,Cold bands of dust surround the closest star to our Solar System — and maybe more planets,https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/4/16603300/proxima-centauri-planets-dust-discs-belts-breakthrough-starshot,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X5c3JGJiRTc6TbdEvCwQxyn90jg=/0x65:1280x735/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9607275/eso1735a.jpg,technology,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to our Solar System, may not have just one planet orbiting around it; the star may host a whole complex planetary system. Astronomers have detected belts of cold dust surrounding Proxima Centauri, indicating that the star is home to many more objects — such as rocks the size of asteroids and even more planets that we haven’t seen yet.

That would mean another complex planetary system is right next door to us — cosmically speaking. Located just over 4 light-years from Earth, Proxima Centauri is the closest star to Earth apart from the Sun. Last year, astronomers discovered that a planet roughly the size of Earth orbits around Proxima Centauri, and it’s located within the star’s habitable zone — the area where temperatures are just right for water to pool on a planet’s surface. That makes the world a prime candidate for studying and even visiting, if we ever send a probe to another star someday.

Proxima Centauri may be home to a complex planetary system

But astronomers have wondered if there is even more to discover around Proxima Centauri. Using the ALMA telescope in Chile, a team of researchers wanted to see if they could detect bands of debris, similar to the bands in our Solar System like the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter or the Kuiper Belt that orbits beyond Neptune. These bands of objects are thought to be leftover remnants from when the Solar System formed 4.5 billion years ago that didn’t form into planets. And the astronomers thought comparable bands might be around Proxima Centauri too.

“So we think that whenever there is a planet around a star, there’s going to be some kind of asteroid belt as well,” Enrique Macías, an astronomer at Boston University and one of the members of the study team, tells The Verge. “It’s just debris from the formation of the system. That’s what we were looking for.”

When observing Proxima Centauri, ALMA detected emissions from a dust band that extends hundreds of millions of miles out from the star. The combined mass of all of the material in the belt is about one-hundredth that of Earth’s, and the band is incredibly cold, around -382 degrees Fahrenheit (-230 degrees Celsius). The findings are to be detailed in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

And it’s possible that’s not the only band around Proxima Centauri. “There seems to be not just one belt, but more than one,” says Macías. “Maybe even three regions of dust.” Data from ALMA indicates there may be two other bands farther out, but more observations are needed to confirm that they exist.

Finding another complex planetary system so close by may mean that our galaxy is filled with complex systems like our own. Plus this discovery just makes the Proxima Centauri system even more tantalizing to researchers. Experts have already proposed a campaign called Breakthrough Starshot, which involves propelling a tiny spacecraft to the Proxima Centauri system using lasers. Now, it seems possible that astronomers will be finding more planets in this star system to study in the future. With so much leftover material around Proxima Centauri that didn’t form into planets, it’s possible that some of this material did become planets that just haven’t been found yet. “Our observation seem to indicate there are going to be more planets, because we see a lot of complexity,” says Macías. “In the close future we’re going to detect other planets in the system for sure.”"

Today, the streaming service announced it is going a step further, and will no longer work with the actor in any capacity whatsoever.

“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of House of Cards that includes Kevin Spacey,” a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement. “We will continue to work with MRC during this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the show. We have also decided we will not be moving forward with the release of the film Gore, which was in post-production, starring and produced by Kevin Spacey.""

In a statement, Media Rights Capital says that Spacey has been suspended from the production, effective immediately.

Production on the show’s sixth season was well underway before Rapp’s allegations surfaced in an interview with BuzzFeed. Spacey responded by coming out as a gay man publicly on Twitter, in what was widely criticized as an attempt to divert attention away from the accusations. Soon thereafter, word broke that the sixth season had already been planned to be the last hurrah for the political drama. On Halloween, both Netflix and production partner Media Rights Capital decided to put production of the series on hold. In the days since, an increasing number of people have come forward with sexual harassment allegations against the actor, with a report from CNN detailing multiple incidents during production of House of Cards itself.

The show’s producers have reportedly been considering ways to move forward, either by killing off Spacey’s character, or perhaps moving to spin-off shows. As for Spacey himself, a representative for the actor said on Wednesday that he is “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.” The actor was dropped by both his publicist and talent agency CAA on November 2nd.

But finding unbiased information is extremely difficult — maybe more so than people realize.

According to an investigation by The Verge, several popular publications covering addiction and treatment double as marketing operations for treatment centers. Rehab Reviews and The Fix are controlled by Cliffside Malibu founder Richard Taite, while Addiction Unscripted — a group promoted by Mark Zuckerberg this summer for its use of Facebook — is owned and staffed by the CEO and marketers of Windward Way, a treatment center in Costa Mesa, California.

All three sites have phone numbers that refer callers to the affiliated rehabs, as well as to partner facilities. On The Fix and Rehab Reviews, there’s a note that the phone number routes you to Service Industries, a “network of commonly owned rehabilitation service providers,” but it doesn’t say which rehabs are in the network, or that Taite owns both the publishers and the providers. Users browsing with an ad blocker will not see the note, just the helpline.

Popular publications covering addiction double as marketing operations

While the connections between the rehabs and the sites are relatively well-known within the industry — Addiction Unscripted even used the Rehab Reviews practice of generating leads for Cliffside Malibu as an example to emulate in an early business plan obtained by The Verge — people reading the sites had no way to know the connection (until disclaimers appeared after The Verge approached the sites for comment).

The Fix, a popular addiction-focused news site, started in 2011 as what The New York Times called “a Web site that combines feature writing, news, video and Zagat-like reviews of rehab facilities.” Two years later, its parent company declared bankruptcy, and the website was sold to the private company, Clean & Sober Media, LLC. Clean & Sober Media also owns Rehab Reviews, which Forbes has called “a Yelp.com for drug rehabs.”

According to a contract reviewed by The Verge and signed by Richard Taite, as well as conversations with people aware of the arrangement, Clean & Sober Media, LLC, is headed by Taite, owner of the California rehab Cliffside Malibu. Loren Beck, the chief legal officer of Cliffside Malibu, was the signatory on Clean & Sober Media’s founding documents. The treatment center is consistently ranked No. 1 on Rehab Reviews’ top 10 list, and given the most prominent spot on The Fix.

The treatment center is consistently ranked No. 1

Taite also owns Access Malibu (as of October 31st, No. 6 on Rehab Reviews’ top 10 list, and No. 8 on The Fix’s top facilities page); Sunset Malibu (No. 4 on both sites); and Recovery Malibu (No. 8 on Rehab Reviews), according to documents filed with the California secretary of state.

“It is correct that Cliffside Malibu and its affiliates collectively operate a total of eight facilities,” a lawyer for Taite responded when The Verge asked for comment. “At certain times, various of these facilities have advertised on one or both websites. However, at no time, have any of these facilities been ‘endorsed’ by either Website, which provide reviews, not endorsements, of various facilities.” The lawyer confirmed that Taite owned Clean & Sober Media.

The lawyer directed The Verge to the websites’ terms and conditions, where one line now says that “Clean & Sober Media, LLC, which is now under common ownership with Cliffside Malibu and its affiliate organizations,” bought The Fix in 2013, and Rehab Reviews in 2014.

Disclaimers appeared after The Verge approached the sites for comment

The most recent archives on the Wayback Machine, from The Fix in September and Rehab Reviews in July, show no such disclaimers.

Some mentions of Cliffside Malibu on The Fix (though not on the treatment center review) are “featured,” and hovering over an informational icon next to the “Featured Centers” banner brings up text that says “Featured centers have paid for placement of their reviews in this section; however, the content and ratings contained in those reviews are editorial content created by The Fix.” There’s no indication that the companies share an owner.

Rehab Reviews doesn’t note the connection to Cliffside at all, except on the new terms and conditions page. Visitors to the site, which bills itself as “The World’s Largest & Most Trusted Resource for Rehab Reviews,” are greeted by a picture of an ocean sunset that reads, “HIGHEST RATED REHABS.” Clicking it brings up the glowing review for Cliffside Malibu. (The site used to have a “Top 10 Rehabs” list in the main menu bar, with Cliffside Malibu consistently at #1, but it was removed after The Verge emailed Taite.)

Most treatment centers have SEO-friendly blogs on their websites, often offering interesting perspectives on news items or debates about treatment. Hazelden Betty Ford has a whole publishing arm that puts out a variety of widely used educational resources. But when a site buries its material connections to a business it funnels customers into, it erodes public trust, and calls into question the information provided by the publication.

“It’s scummy, it’s misleading.”

Joe Schrank, one of the two original founders of The Fix, has strong feelings about the marketing model their former site is now part of. “It’s scummy, it’s misleading,” he told The Verge. After the acquisition, he and the other founder, Maer Roshan, discussed coming back as editors. But both ultimately felt the price was too high.

“They wanted final editorial approval,” Schrank said. “‘Well, we’ll probably never use it,’ they said. We just couldn’t do that.”

One of The Fix’s first stories, “Inside Scientology’s Rehab Racket,” was an expose on Scientology-affiliated rehab chain Narconon. According to Zachary Siegel, a journalist who started writing for the site in the early days, The Fix’s appetite for reporting changed after the purchase, although he was unaware of Taite’s involvement until The Verge told him.

“When it came to stories that dealt with exposing fraud and corruption, I was told that the publication didn’t have resources to defend itself against litigious rehabs. I did manage to also get some fraud and corruption stuff into The Fix - it just didn’t have the teeth that I wanted,” Siegel said.

“I stand by everything I wrote at The Fix, but also, in the context of all the fraud and corruption going on in the industry, I do think there’s a need for transparency here.” (Siegel ultimately published several of those stories elsewhere.)

The Fix saw other changes under its new ownership, including the steadily increasing presence of free insurance verifications for treatment coverage, first in a blinking banner ad and then as a pop-up. Around the time of the transition, Cliffside Malibu appeared at the top of a new “best-rated rehabs” section.

The review was first given a full five stars

The review for Cliffside got a nip / tuck, too. The archived, staff-written review of Cliffside Malibu from 2012 gives the center four stars. It’s quite positive throughout, but mentions a few flaws. Originally, it highlighted the “top-notch staff,” but said the “medical doctors used for calls or consultations were only ‘somewhat helpful,’ and occasionally look as though they’ve just dropped by after brunch. ‘I didn’t feel the love,’ said one alumnus.”

After Clean & Sober Media took over, the review was first given a full five stars, and then later changed to read: “although there are no live-in doctors, the on-call physicians are very accessible, helpful, responsive to patients’ needs...One alum who went through detox five times before coming to Cliffside said it was the best detox experience he’d had—and most importantly, he hasn’t needed it since.” The review date still reads March 2012.

“Any implication that the content of an editorial review, including its aesthetics, is influenced by whether a treatment center has paid for advertising is false,” Taite’s lawyer said in a statement.

Maer Roshan, Schrank’s co-founder at The Fix, told The Verge that he believes addiction deserves a serious and credible news source. His and Schrank’s original vision for the site was to not be associated with treatment centers at all. “That’s what made the rehab reviews authentic,” he said. “To me, that authenticity is shadowed by the ownership.”

Clean & Sober Media is far from the only publisher owned in whole or in part by people with a financial interest in a treatment center or addiction-related business. Another is Addiction Unscripted, a group that gained recognition earlier this year when Mark Zuckerberg wrote a long Facebook post promoting both the website and its affiliated Facebook group, Affected By Addiction Support Group, which has over 52,000 members. (Addiction Unscripted itself has nearly 200,000 Facebook likes.)

“We're looking for ways to help people find groups that will be meaningful to them,” the Facebook founder wrote to his 97.8 million followers in July. “Dealing with addiction can be isolating and AddictionUnscripted.com is a place for people affected by addiction to come together. Now if you join their page, you can request to join the Affected By Addiction Support Group to connect with people who are going through the same thing.”

Facebook invited Addiction Unscripted co-founder Matt Mendoza and his partner Jeremy Broderick to the 2017 Facebook Communities Summit at Facebook headquarters, where Mendoza spoke about his role creating a “safe space for people who are experiencing or recovering from drug and alcohol addiction.”

Zuckerberg wrote a long Facebook post promoting the site and its affiliated Facebook group

That safe space has another purpose: generating admissions for Costa Mesa treatment center Windward Way and its sister facility, Casa Capri.

Broderick, the CEO of Windward Way, owns about 20 percent of Addiction Unscripted. Mendoza is a marketer at Windward Way, with an office next to Broderick’s. The phone number for Addiction Unscripted, listed on Affected By Addiction Support Group as the primary resource for people in need, rings to Windward Way’s marketers.

“The Affected By Addiction Support Group on Facebook is essentially mined and operated by admissions counselors at Windward Way,” a source inside the company told The Verge. Marketers, including Mendoza, send private messages to people who post to the group, offering support and suggesting they call the hotline.

Mendoza, who was convicted of wire fraud in 2010, told The Verge that Facebook was aware of Broderick’s connection to Windward Way, and that the support group was generating admissions for the rehab. When asked how the Facebook page grew so quickly, he declined to explain, saying it wasn’t relevant.

“We’re aware of Matt’s connection to Windward, and we have many other community leaders on Facebook using Groups as a channel to both create a community around a passion or cause, and as a way to financially support that community,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Verge. “We’re always happy to see Groups and other Facebook tools as forces to build communities and create positive real-world impact.”

The spokesperson went on to mention a rock collection fan page associated with a store that sells rocks, and a group for Unicorn Moms, defined as moms who “couldn’t care less what you think.” That group sells branded merchandise, including a mug that says, “There’s a chance this is VODKA.”

“The Affected By Addiction Support Group on Facebook is essentially mined and operated by admissions counselors at Windward Way.”

The Facebook spokesperson did not respond to a request for clarification that Facebook was comparing branded merchandising to rehab referral.

Both Broderick and Mendoza spoke to The Verge about their desire to be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem, in addiction treatment ethics.

Mendoza denied that there was an ethical conflict in not disclosing the connection between the publisher and the rehabs. “The only intention is, for people who need help, this is a great facility, and it’s the only one I know will do the right thing for the patient,” he told The Verge. “I’m lucky enough to have these people around me, and Jeremy, who dedicated his people to answering the phone in very effective and ethical ways.”

“Matt’s kind of the quarterback of it. I’m just kind of a passenger in the car. I don’t even speak the little techie language,” Broderick told The Verge, saying that his relationship with Addiction Unscripted wasn’t generating the number of admissions for Windward Way he was hoping it would when they first teamed up. “It’s turned into something that I didn’t intend it becoming, so I’m probably going to be, effective today, severing all ties.”

Shortly after that call, Addiction Unscripted’s treatment center directory and reviews were taken down, and a disclaimer was added to the top: “ADDICTIONUNSCRIPTED.COM IS AFFILIATED WITH WINDWARDWAY RECOVERY, PHONE CALLS FROM THIS SITE ARE FORWARDED TO WINDWARDWAY RECOVERY AND THEIR ADDICTION SPECIALISTS.”

After the call, Addiction Unscripted’s treatment center directory was taken down

Addiction Unscripted was launched as a directory site, using user-generated and commissioned articles to drive leads. According to Mendoza, the company quickly pivoted toward social media, including Pandora and Grindr, along with Facebook.

Mendoza denied that every caller is sent to Windward Way or Casa Capri, only those who are a “good fit.” For example, people who can’t afford the treatment center, either through cash or insurance, are sent to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) treatment locator. Both Broderick and Mendoza said the majority of callers from Addiction Unscripted couldn’t afford Windward Way.

Earlier this week, apparently alerted to questions about his business model, Mendoza published a Huffington Post article defending his choice to partner with a treatment center, though the article doesn’t mention which facility it is. (When asked why he didn’t name the treatment center, Mendoza laughed and said, “I didn't find that relevant. I didn't find it relevant at all. If somebody wanted to find out, it wouldn’t be hard.”)

In the post, Mendoza called for improved ethics in treatment center marketing.

On Facebook, the Affected By Addiction Support Group still has no mention of Windward Way, despite hosting a “call now” button that rings to the rehab. That hotline is also listed in a pinned post of page rules. (“...If you ever need help from an addiction counselor, please call our helpline...or send a private msg to Matthew Mendoza.”) Another rule is no posting “pictures or articles from other websites or treatment centers.”

Addiction Unscripted’s now-deleted directory was an example of one of the strangest legacies of the eternal SEO war; The Fix and Rehab Reviews are both based around these old-school business directories, too.

It doesn’t take much to create your own directory site. WordPress, for instance, has several templates. All you have to do is seed it with thousands of listings and get some traction in Google through links from high-value sites. (Talking to news sites as an “addiction expert” and asking for a backlink is a perennial favorite.) Once the site shows up in Google searches, business owners can be charged for better real estate on the site and more eye-catching listings.

It listed the treatment center’s name and address, but Addiction Unscripted’s phone number

Treatment marketers have it particularly easy, because they can legally copy listings from the free treatment locators offered by SAMHSA. While there’s no doubt it’s much too hard to find treatment in the United States, directory sites don’t tend to help much, since they’re often full of inaccurate and incomplete information.

Addiction Unscripted’s now-deleted directory took things a step further. On any listing that didn’t feature one of its own reviews, it listed the treatment center’s name and address, but Addiction Unscripted’s phone number, and no warning that it rings to a marketing hotline. (The Fix and Rehab Reviews include treatment centers’ real numbers.)

“It’s heartbreaking.”

When asked about the lack of disclosure around his business interests, Broderick expressed frustration around what he painted as confusing regulations. “You don’t know it’s wrong until someone, like, all of a sudden someone says, ‘Hey that’s wrong,’ and you’re like, ‘Well, what am I doing wrong? I didn’t know this was wrong!’ Obviously, getting people high, paying people, all the stuff you see in Florida is wrong, but a lot of this stuff is just arbitrary,” he told The Verge.

But these secret connections create a black hole where good journalism should be, according to Schrank, co-founder of The Fix.

“It’s heartbreaking, in a lot of ways. The original intention of The Fix as a watchdog isn’t being executed anywhere,” Schrank told The Verge. Addicts and people who care about them are a huge audience that cuts across many demographics. “Why can’t we sell them mountain bikes and jeans? Why do we have to sell them more treatment?”"

Filmmaker David Gaddie recently released an adaptation of Liu’s 2012 short story Memories of My Mother, a heart-wrenching short that calls to mind brilliant science fiction stories such as Arrival and Black Mirror.

The story’s premise is simple: a young mother is ill with an unnamed, terminal disease. With only two years left to live, she decides to stretch out her remaining years by going into space, using relativity to slow down time and visiting every few years so that she can watch her daughter grow up.

Liu originally published Memories of My Mother in Daily Science Fiction, a website that e-mails a piece of flash fiction to you each day. Liu explained to The Verge in an e-mail that he couldn’t remember the exact moment of inspiration for the story, but that he “was trying to tell the story of the arc of a life via these vignettes taken at different points in the arc — and letting the reader fill in the spaces in-between”. The brevity of Memories of My Mother makes it a marvel of a short story that grips, you in just a handful of paragraphs.

Gaddie told The Verge that he first encountered the Liu’s work with his story The Paper Menagerie. He approached the author for the rights to adapt it, only to find that they weren’t available. Instead, Liu pointed him to Memories of My Mother. Gaddie explained that what appealed to him the most about this story was that it made him cry when he read it. “Ken's sensitivity and ability to tell stories that are bigger than the technology, that are more human stories that are told through the kind of the lens of technology is what is really appealing,” he explained, and says that he has small children, and related to the idea of “watching your children growing up, while you remain this kind of static figure to them.”

Liu doesn’t really describe the world surrounding his characters, so Gaddie had to come up with a visual world that evolved over decades. Drones fly by windows, while holographic pictures line the walls of the characters’ home. But while he had to show off the technology, Gaddie opted to keep it in the background. “I want to keep the tech simple and integrated as much as possible,” using technology minimally to focus on the emotional story rather than the technological one.

Gaddie says that he isn’t done with Liu’s work just yet. His next project, he says, is another adaptation of one of the author’s novellas, The Regular, which follows a private detective who is hunting for a serial killer who has been stealing cybernetic upgrades from his victims.

Approaching the first anniversary of his victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, Trump has an approval rating demonstrably lower than any previous chief executive at this point in his presidency over seven decades of polling. Fewer than 4 in 10 Americans — 37 percent — say they approve of the way he is handling his job.

Trump’s approval rating has changed little over the past four months, which have included tumultuous events, from hurricanes to legislative setbacks to indictments in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into the role Russia played in the 2016 campaign.

[Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted]

The president’s disapproval rating has reached 59 percent, with 50 percent saying they strongly disapprove of the job he is doing. While little changed since the summer, both represent the worst marks of his presidency.





He is the only president dating back to Harry S. Truman whose approval rating at this point in his presidency is net negative — by 22 points. The next worst recorded in that time was Bill Clinton, who had a net positive of 11 points by this time in his presidency.

Trump began his presidency with only modest expectations on the part of a public that was divided coming out of last year’s contentious election. Roughly 100 days into his presidency, 42 percent said he had accomplished a great deal or a good amount while in office. Today, that has declined to 35 percent.

Meanwhile, 65 percent say he has accomplished “not much” or “little or nothing.” This is up from 56 percent last spring. Forty-three percent of all Americans give him the lowest possible rating, saying he has accomplished “little or nothing.”

At the 100-day mark of Trump’s presidency last spring, Americans were split almost evenly on the question of whether he was keeping most of his major campaign promises, with 44 percent saying he was and 41 percent disagreeing. Today the verdict is more severe, with a majority (55 percent) saying he is not keeping most of those promises.

The public sees Democrats acting mostly as an opposition party, rather than offering ideas of their own. Asked whether the Democratic Party is presenting alternatives to Trump’s proposals or mainly criticizing the president, 61 percent said mainly criticizing, identical to the percentage who said this of Republican Party leaders one year after Obama’s election. Only a plurality of Democrats (47 percent) say their leaders are offering alternatives to Trump’s ideas.

Trump’s actions and behavior have drawn sharp criticism from a few members of his own party, most recently from Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona. Former president George W. Bush delivered a recent speech that, while never mentioning Trump by name, was seen as a rebuke of the way the president is conducting himself in office.

The Post-ABC News poll asked self-identified Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP whether they believed their party leaders should speak out when they disagree with the president. Overall, 71 percent said they should, with just 27 percent saying those leaders should avoid criticizing him, including 65 percent of Trump voters who say Republicans should air their disagreements.

On four key issues, Trump has not matched the early expectations for his presidency, and today, majorities — in some case strong majorities — give him negative reviews. Those issues are the economy, dealing with race relations, improving the health-care system and dealing with the threat of terrorism. (Part of this survey was conducted before the terrorist attack on Tuesday that left eight people dead in New York.)

The president has pointed to what he sees as significant accomplishments in the area of the economy, with the stock market at record levels, unemployment at 4.1 percent — a 17-year low — and growth in the two most recent quarters at 3 percent.

But the public gives him little credit for the state of the economy. Last January, 61 percent offered a positive assessment when asked how they thought he would handle the economy. Today, 44 percent give him positive marks, while 53 percent say he has not done well.

In January, a majority (56 percent) said they believed he would do an excellent or good job dealing with threats of terrorism. Today, 43 percent give him positive reviews.

Trump receives even lower ratings on race and health care. Fewer than 3 in 10 say he has done a good job dealing with race relations, which is 12 points below the 40 percent who said in January they thought he would handle race issues effectively. Half of all Americans say they believe Trump is biased against black people and slightly more (55 percent) say he is biased against women.

The racial assessment follows a backlash to Trump’s comments about the white supremacist rally in August in Charlottesville, where marchers chanted Nazi slogans and the ensuing violence left one woman dead and others injured. Two state police officers also died when their helicopter crashed after assisting in the unrest. Trump was slow to condemn the marchers and at one point said there were “very fine people” among the neo-Nazi demonstrators.

In January, 44 percent said they expected him to handle the issue of health care effectively, including 87 percent of Republicans. Optimism has faded sharply, with 26 percent of Americans and 59 percent of Republicans giving him positive marks today. The overall percentage offering a negative assessment has jumped from 51 percent in January to 70 percent today, including 47 percent who give him the lowest rating, “poor.”

Political independents have soured the most considering Trump’s pre-inaugural expectations and current ratings. The percentage of independents saying Trump is doing a good job on the economy, race relations and health care is more than 20 points lower than the percentage that expected him to perform well in January. On terrorism, today’s ratings are 17 points below early expectations among independents.

Congressional Republicans were stymied in their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, despite years of promises to do so. The House, after first failing to pass a bill, eventually approved a measure and sent it to the Senate. Senate Republican leaders struggled to get a health bill to the floor for consideration. When they did, they fell short of the necessary majority needed to keep the process moving.

Throughout that process, Trump prodded the Republican leadership, principally Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), with demeaning tweets demanding action. Ever since the effort broke down, Trump has attempted to focus the ire of disappointed conservatives on those congressional Republicans, but the failed effort also appears to have taken a toll on him.

A solid majority (59 percent) also see Trump as trying to make the federal health law fail. Less than one-tenth of the public says they support those efforts to scuttle the law through executive actions, while overall, 50 percent of the public opposes what they see as Trump undermining the existing program.

As tensions mount over North Korea’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon and delivery system capable of hitting the United States, the public has little trust in the president to handle the problem responsibly. A majority (51 percent) say they trust him “not at all” on this national security issue and 16 percent say they trust him “just some.” Meanwhile, 32 percent say they trust him “a great deal” or “a good amount.”

Other measures highlight the degree to which Trump is governing with the support of a minority of the population. Four in 10 say he is a strong leader. That’s 13 points below the level in April. On this question, he has gone from a net positive of eight points to a net negative of 19 points. Roughly twice as many Americans say that under Trump, U.S. leadership in the world has gotten weaker rather than stronger, 53 to 26 percent.

Trump campaigned on his dealmaking ability, but the public doubts his ability to forge political agreements. Almost 6 in 10 say he is not good at making political deals while under 4 in 10 say he is good at making deals.

One-third say he is honest and trustworthy, down only marginally since April. On the question of whether he has the temperament and personality needed to serve as president, 31 percent say yes, while 66 percent say no. That is the lowest since August 2016, when candidate Trump was embroiled in a controversy with a Gold Star family.

A minority of 37 percent say he understands the problems “of people like you,” unchanged since last spring, while 42 percent say he has brought needed change to Washington, marginally better than when last measured two months ago.

Of those Americans who say they voted in 2016, 46 percent say they supported Clinton, and 43 percent say they backed Trump. If an election were held today, with the same candidates, 40 percent of those 2016 voters say they would back Trump, and 40 percent say they would support Clinton.

Trump has succeeded in satisfying voters who elected him president but few others. Voters who supported Trump continue to be overwhelmingly supportive, with 91 percent approving of his performance, including 69 percent “strongly.” A still larger 95 percent of Clinton voters disapprove of him, with 88 percent who feel that way strongly. Among those who supported neither candidate — or did not vote — 24 percent approve of Trump while 68 percent disapprove.

The Post-ABC poll was conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 1 among a random national sample of 1,005 adults reached on cell and landline phones with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

The only way to locate and secure all of North Korea’s nuclear weapons sites “with complete certainty” is through an invasion of ground forces, and in the event of conflict, Pyongyang could use biological and chemical weapons, the Pentagon told lawmakers in a new, blunt assessment of what war on the Korean Peninsula might look like.

The Pentagon, in a letter to lawmakers, said that a full discussion of U.S. capabilities to “counter North Korea’s ability to respond with a nuclear weapon and to eliminate North Korea’s nuclear weapons located in deeply buried, underground facilities” is best suited for a classified briefing.

The letter also said that Pentagon leaders “assess that North Korea may consider the use of biological weapons” and that the country “has a long-standing chemical weapons program with the capability to produce nerve, blister, blood and choking agents.”

The Pentagon repeated that a detailed discussion of how the United States would respond to the threat could not be discussed in public.

[The message behind the murder: How an assassination sheds light on North Korea’s chemical weapons program]

The letter was written by Rear Adm. Michael J. Dumont, the vice director of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff, in response to a request for information from two House members about “expected casualty assessments in a conflict with North Korea,” including for civilians and U.S. and allied forces in South Korea, Japan and Guam.

“A decision to attack or invade another country will have ramifications for our troops and taxpayers, as well as the region, for decades,” Ted Lieu (D-

Calif.) and Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) wrote to the Pentagon. “We have not heard detailed analysis of expected U.S. or allied force casualties, expected civilian casualties, what plans exist for the aftermath of a strike — including continuity of the South Korean Government.”

The Pentagon said that calculating “best- or worst-case casualty scenarios” was challenging and would depend on the “nature, intensity and duration” of a North Korean attack; how much warning civilians would have to get to the thousands of shelters in South Korea; and the ability of U.S. and South Korean forces to respond to North Korean artillery, rockets and ballistic missiles with their own retaliatory barrage and airstrikes.

The letter noted that Seoul, the South Korean capital, is a densely populated area with 25 million residents.

Any operation to pursue North Korean nuclear weapons would likely be spearheaded by U.S. Special Operations troops. Last year, President Barack Obama and then-Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter gave U.S. Special Operations Command a new, leading role coordinating the Pentagon’s effort to counter weapons of mass destruction. SOCOM did not receive any new legal authorities for the mission but gained influence in how the military responds to such threats.

Elite U.S. forces have long trained to respond in the case of a so-called “loose nuke” in the hands of terrorists. But senior officials said SOCOM is increasingly focused on North Korea.

[A North Korean ship was seized off Egypt with a huge cache of weapons destined for a surprising buyer]

Dumont said the military backs the current U.S. strategy on North Korea, which is led by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and focuses on ratcheting up economic and diplomatic pressure as the primary effort to get North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to stop developing nuclear weapons. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., have emphasized that during trips to Seoul this year.

In contrast, President Trump, who goes unmentioned in the Pentagon letter, has taunted Kim as “Rocket Man” and expressed frustration with diplomatic efforts, hinting that he is considering preemptive military force.

“I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,” Trump tweeted on Oct. 1, adding, “Save your energy Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!”

On Oct. 7, Trump added in additional tweets that North Korea had “made fools” of U.S. negotiators. “Sorry, but only one thing will work!” he said.

Mattis and other Pentagon leaders have often cited the grave threat faced by Seoul, but the military much less frequently draws attention to its plans for an underground hunt for nuclear weapons.

Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, said that Dumont and other Pentagon officials had no additional comment about the letter.

A senior U.S. military official in South Korea, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, said that while the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea maintain a high degree of readiness, he “has to believe” that North Korea does not want a war, given all of the nations aligned against it.

“If you open the history books, this is not the first time that we’ve been in a heavy provocation cycle,” the official said. On the side of South Korea and the United States, he said, “there is no action taken without extreme consideration of not putting this in a position where a fight is going to happen.”

Dumont’s letter also notes that “we have not seen any change in the offensive posture of North Korea’s forces.”

A statement by 16 lawmakers, released simultaneously with the Pentagon letter, urged Trump to stop making “provocative statements” that impede diplomatic efforts and risk the lives of U.S. troops.

The Pentagon’s “assessment underscores what we’ve known all along: There are no good military options for North Korea,” said the statement, organized by Lieu and Gallego and signed by 14 other members of Congress who are veterans, all but one of them Democrats.

In a telephone interview, Lieu said that the intent of asking the Pentagon for information was to spell out the cataclysmic consequences of war with North Korea and the aftermath.

“It’s important for people to understand what a war with a nuclear power would look like,” said Lieu, citing estimates of 300,000 dead in the first few days alone. More than 100,000 Americans are potentially at risk.

Lieu, who spent part of his time in the Air Force on Guam preparing for military action against North Korea, called the letter a confirmation that a conflict would result in a “bloody, protracted ground war.” The Joint Chiefs, he believes, are “trying to send a message to the American public,” he said.

“This is grim,” Lieu said. “We need to understand what war means. And it hasn’t been articulated very well. I think they’re trying to articulate some of that.”

Gallego said that he wanted information because of what he sees as a cavalier attitude in the White House about military action in North Korea. The idea that a ground invasion would be needed to secure nuclear weapons is eye-opening, he said, and raises the possibility of the U.S. military losing thousands of troops.

“I think that you’re dealing with career professionals at the Pentagon who realize that the drumbeats of war could actually end up leading us to war,” he said. “They want to make sure that there is full transparency and information out there about what can occur if our civilian leaders make wrong calculations.”

The Pentagon letter also notes the possibility of “opposition from China or Russia.”

“The Department of Defense maintains a set of up-to-date contingency plans to secure our vital national security interests,” Dumont wrote. “These plans account for a wide range of possibilities, including third-party intervention, and address how best to ‘contain escalation.’ ”

The letter says that both “Russia or China may prefer to avoid conflict with the United States, or possibly cooperate with us.”"

Here's what you need to know about it. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)

President Trump promised to cut taxes for the middle class, but some would end up paying more under the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” according to a report released Friday night by Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, the official scorekeepers tasked with determining how much any tax legislation would add to the debt and how it would impact the poor, middle class and wealthy.

The Trump administration says it has a “bright line test” that the president won't support any tax bill that does not give the middle class relief on their taxes. The “Tax Cuts And Jobs Act” that House Republicans released Thursday appears to violate that vow, at least for some middle-class taxpayers.

The JCT found that the GOP bill would add nearly $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next decade and that, on average, families earning between $20,000 and $40,000 a year and between $200,000 to $500,000 would pay more in individual income taxes in 2023 and beyond.

JCT does not explain why these families see an increase, but it is likely that it's in part because some tax credits aimed at helping the middle class expire in 2023, including the Family Flexibility Credit. Republicans are currently debating whether to extend this credit, but that would require revenue from somewhere else. Some are banking on Congress not allowing the credit to expire when the time comes. Upper middle-class families are also losing popular tax breaks like the state and local income tax (SALT) deduction, which may explain why they get higher tax bills.

It's possible that other families will also see their tax bills jump under the plan. JCT only reports what happens to the average taxpayer in each income bracket. Experts across the political spectrum, including the Tax Policy Center, plan to release more detailed reports in the coming days showing what happens to large and small families, rich and poor, and those that claim big medical deductions under the GOP plan.

House Republicans argue that the JCT analysis undercounts the benefits to the middle class.

“The purpose of tax reform isn’t just to lower taxes for struggling families – it’s also to make our economy boom again,” said the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee in a statement Saturday. “Unfortunately, JCT’s analysis omits the economic effects of tax reform in their distributional tables. This means that the JCT analysis misses the bigger picture.”

But Democratic tax experts say most of the benefits go to the richest Americans.

“JCT’s estimates show that this bill is heavily tilted toward the wealthy,” says Lily Batchelder, a tax law professor at New York University and former member of President Obama's National Economic Council.

Batchhelder used the JCT analysis to look at who gets the biggest income boost from the GOP plan. She found that millionaires would see their after-tax incomes rise by 2.2 percent after a decade, and that is without factoring in how wealthy families benefit for the elimination of the estate tax. Families earning $50,000 to $70,000 — the middle of the middle — would see only a 0.6 percent rise, and families earning $20,000 to $40,000 get no benefit.

Trump and congressional Republicans argue that business tax cuts would also help the middle class because companies will create more jobs and pay workers more.

The Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank, found that the GOP bill would result in almost a million more full-time jobs and that wages would rise for many workers.

“The larger economy and higher wages are due chiefly to the significantly lower cost of capital under the proposal, which is mainly due to the lower corporate income tax rate,” the Tax Foundation wrote in a report Friday.

JCT also took a close look at what happens to people's incomes after taking into account the business tax cuts. JCT found that more Americans would be better off, but some families, especially in the $20,000 to $40,000 range would still see tax increases after 2023. JCT assumes about a quarter of the tax savings that businesses receive would end up in the pockets of workers because of higher wages. Wealthier families also benefit from higher stock dividends and changes to small businesses taxes.

There are winners and losers in any tax bill. In general, large families and those that currently take a lot of deductions for medical expenses or state and local taxes are hurt the most by the changes in the GOP plan. Some are already calling it a hit to “blue states” since a lot more people in states like California, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey earn upper middle-class incomes and benefit heavily from the state and local tax deduction.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has emphasized that a true middle-class family — a family of four earning $59,000 a year — would pay $1,182 less in taxes in 2018 than they would this year. But David Kamin a tax professor at New York University, modeled what would happen to that family over the next decade and found that even that model family would end up paying more in tax by 2024.

When Diane Thorsen began to show signs at an early age of the Alzheimer’s disease that had stolen her mother’s mind, she and her husband, Richard Davis, were as ready as they could be.

They sold their house in California to prepare for the cost of care and moved to Minnesota to live with one of Thorsen’s daughters. Davis planned their finances methodically; once Thorsen’s long-term care insurance ran out, the daunting $98,000 bill for her nursing home would be manageable — because they could deduct medical expenses from their tax bill.

But as the Republican tax plan took shape, Davis felt as though the rug was being pulled out from under them. He plugged numbers into a spreadsheet as details of the plan emerged, finally arriving at the conclusion that after all his budgeting to avoid digging into savings, he would need to withdraw about $24,000 next year.

“I kind of had everything all planned out. I had it planned out to where I really wasn’t spending any time worrying about the finances,” Davis said. “It’s kind of a kick in the stomach to have it all figured out and then to have it kind of all start falling apart.”

[Share your story: Will the Republican tax plan help or hurt your family?]

In their plan to cut taxes and declutter the tax code, Republicans have proposed repealing all but a small handful of tax breaks. But people rely on those tax breaks in budgeting for medical expenses, adopting children, replacing stolen or disaster-damaged property, and even paying for business expenses.

These credits and deductions don’t feel like loopholes to the people who depend on them. Those tax breaks have shaped people’s financial lives in fundamental ways, providing relief from taxes on spending that isn’t optional.

“As soon as they talked about eliminating these deductions, that’s when it caught my attention: Uh-oh, I’m in trouble now,” Davis said. “It’s going to throw out of whack all the projections I’ve made for what we’ll have available in 2018.”

The Republican tax plan aims to do away with itemization for most people by doubling the standard deduction to $24,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The plan preserves some of the most popular deductions — for mortgage interest, property taxes and charitable contributions — but it imposes new limits. For new home loans, interest payments can be deducted only for the first $500,000, and only up to $10,000 in property taxes can be deducted.

[GOP tax plan would shrink mortgage interest benefit, slash corporate tax rate]

But the medical expense deduction, taken on about 8.8 million tax returns in 2015, is one of the many being repealed.

It isn’t the most common tax break — in part because it requires a person’s medical expenses to be greater than 10 percent of their adjusted gross income. But for those who do take it, the deduction can be crucial.

The most obvious scenarios include an older person with a pension who would otherwise owe tax, or a family that pays to care for an older parent in a nursing home. But it isn’t just older people, several tax specialists said.

Eliminating the medical deduction could affect parents of children with special needs, who might use the tax break to deduct expenses not covered by insurance.

Working-age people with a serious illness such as cancer might also use it in the face of high out-of-pocket medical costs and earnings that are lower because they can’t work.

“I just don’t see why these people should lose their deductions, just like that,” said Steven Kronzek, a certified public accountant based in the District. “It’s mostly elderly, it’s not wealthy people, and there’s no lobbyists running around to look out for these people.”

Republicans have argued that their proposed revisions would make the tax code simpler and result in savings for families.

“Our bill lowers the tax rates and increases the standard deduction so people can immediately keep more of their paychecks — instead of having to rely on a myriad of provisions that many will never use and others may use only once in their lifetime,” said House Ways and Means Committee spokeswoman Lauren Aronson. “This tax relief will give families the flexibility to use their paychecks for what’s most important to them — whether for home repairs, different medical expenses, or other unique expenses that come up at different stages of life.”

Tax preparers are still reviewing the bill to see whether it could have consequences for their clients. But Leon LaBrecque, chief executive of LJPR Financial Advisors in Michigan, said that given the current complicated system, simplifying the tax code might have a number of unintended consequences.

“What I call the slightly disingenuous version is that everyone gets a tax cut. It’s way too complicated a system,” LaBrecque said. He listed off people who might be losing a valuable deduction: salespeople who deduct big unreimbursed business expenses, as well as police, firefighters and others who deduct union dues.

In a year marked by major natural disasters such as hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and devastating wildfires in California, some tax preparers raised concerns about eliminating tax deductions for casualty losses, such as major property damage due to storms.

“It definitely provides a huge benefit, particularly for those who are in our area who unfortunately did not have flood insurance,” said Jason Sanders, the tax department head at Briggs & Veselka, a certified public accounting firm in Houston. “If the bill were to pass as it stands now, the casualty loss deduction would be repealed and we would just have to rely on Congress to bring it back in the case of a disaster-type situation.”

[The country’s flood insurance program is sinking. Rescuing it won’t be easy.]

Congress recognized the importance of the tax break for disaster recovery after this year’s hurricanes, taking steps to waive limits on the casualty loss deduction. The tax bill would not interfere with that legislation, and Sanders said he was hopeful that Congress would act to reinstate the deduction in the case of future disasters, even if the tax plan passed.

The plan also strikes the adoption tax credit, worth up to $13,570 per child in 2017, even though Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), the chief writer of the tax plan, is father to two adopted sons. The credit is used to help families with adoption expenses, which can include legal fees, court costs and travel.

The credit was taken on nearly 64,000 returns in 2015, according to Internal Revenue Service data, and its removal could discourage adoptions, advocates warned.

How or whether individuals will be affected by the loss of deductions will depend on their personal circumstances, but even provisions that may have a relatively modest effect on an individual’s tax bill could be significant in the message they send.

“What is the biggest piece of growth in the individual debt? When you look at that pie, these days it’s student loan debt — more than a trillion dollars now. So, hey, congratulations, millennials!” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. “The modest benefit you got from deducting that interest? That’s going away.”

But those with very large medical expenses may be in the most difficult position of all, and it might lead to difficult choices — pushing some families to put parents on Medicaid rather than pay for the nursing home.

Davis knows there are families in worse situations; he and Thorsen are fortunate to have pensions, savings and family support. They met at work in Santa Cruz, Calif., nearly three decades ago. He worked as a supervisor at the data center, she as a computer programmer.

They got to know each other playing beach volleyball and softball, and they loved being active, skiing at Lake Tahoe and playing with their dogs.

But they knew what might loom in their future. Thorsen’s mother had an early-onset form of Alzheimer’s, and her father suffered from it later in life. They bought long-term care insurance when they were in their 40s.

Anticipation doesn’t make the relentless disease any easier to cope with; it’s painful to see Thorsen, who enjoyed socializing with friends and going out dancing, slowly vanish.

But Davis visits her often and says that some of the important pieces are still there, even if Thorsen can’t put them together.

Once when he was sitting with her and had a book in her lap, he was surprised to realize she could still read. And she knows the names of family members, although he isn’t sure she knows who they are when they visit.

The disease is overwhelming on its own. To think about carefully laid financial plans crumbling — he anticipates his tax bill will jump by about $20,000 in a year — makes it harder.

“It entails dipping into savings. There’s no getting around that,” Davis said. “If it ever got to a point where it becomes too unmanageable — where we would see the end of the road in our savings — there is an end to the road.”"

(Alex Brandon/AFP/Getty Images)

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia’s King Salman on Saturday removed a prominent prince who headed the National Guard, replaced the economy minister and announced the creation of a new anti-corruption committee.

The Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel also reported late Saturday that 11 princes and dozens of former ministers were detained in a new anti-corruption probe headed by the kingdom’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was also named to oversee the new committee.

Al-Arabiya reported that the committee is looking into devastating and deadly floods that overwhelmed parts of the city of Jiddah in 2009 and is investigating the Saudi government’s response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus that has killed several hundred people in the past few years.

Meanwhile, the kingdom’s top council of clerics issued a statement saying it is an Islamic duty to fight corruption— essentially giving religious backing to the high-level arrests being reported.

The government said the anti-corruption committee has the right to issue arrest warrants, impose travel restrictions and freeze bank accounts. It can also trace funds, prevent the transfer of funds or the liquidation of assets and take other precautionary measures until cases are referred to the judiciary.

The royal order said the committee was established “due to the propensity of some people for abuse, putting their personal interest above public interest, and stealing public funds.”

Saudi nationals have long complained of rampant corruption in government and of public funds being squandered or misused by people in power.

The 32-year-old crown prince has been seeking to attract greater international investments and improve the country’s reputation as a place to do business. It’s part of a larger effort to diversify the economy away from dependence on oil revenue.

The king ousted one of the country’s highest-level royals from power, removing Prince Miteb bin Abdullah as head of the National Guard. He was replaced by Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin, who had held a senior post with the guard.

Prince Miteb’s father was the late King Abdullah, who also had led the National Guard and had transformed it into a powerful and prestigious force tasked with protecting the ruling Al Saud family, as well as important holy sites in Mecca and Medina, and oil and gas sites.

Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne. His ouster as head of the National Guard essentially sidelines one of the most formidable rivals to the current crown prince, who has amassed enormous power in less than three years since his father, King Salman, ascended to the throne.

It comes just three months after Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was ousted from the line of succession and from his post as interior minister, overseeing internal security.

With the two princes now sidelined, control of the kingdom’s security apparatus is now largely centralized under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is also defense minister.

The monarch also replaced Minister of Economy and Planning Adel Fakeih with his deputy, Mohammad al-Tuwaijri.

Admiral Abdullah Al-Sultan was also sacked as commander of Saudi Naval Forces and replaced by Admiral Fahd bin Abdullah Al-Ghifaili.

(Juan Manuel Herrera/OAS/Juan Manuel Herrera/OAS)

His affiliations were a roll call of institutions whose very names suggest power, influence and global reach: the London Academy of Diplomacy, the London Center of International Law Practice, the Euro-Mediterranean University.

His titles had a loftiness to match: president, director, and according to his online biography, “founding father of the term ‘Academic Diplomacy.’ ”

But in the plea agreement unsealed last week as part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russian influence on last year’s U.S. presidential election, he is simply and mysteriously “the professor.”

Joseph Mifsud, the man who, according to court papers, offered himself as a bridge between the Trump campaign and the highest echelons of the Kremlin, has spent his career trading one impressive-looking business card for the next.

[Who is George Papadopoulos, the Trump adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators?]

To George Papadopoulos, the Trump foreign policy aide who liaised with Mifsud, the Maltese academic may have appeared to be just the sort of man needed to cut through the impenetrable fog of Moscow power structures.

But a review of Mifsud’s credentials and connections reveals plenty of fog there, as well.

At the Scottish university where he was a professor, he was seldom if ever seen by fellow faculty or students. At the Slovenian university where he was president, he left amid a swirl of accusations of financial impropriety, including a cellphone bill that topped $1,000 a month. And at the London law center where he served as an adviser, others named as part of the firm’s “team” were shocked this week to learn of the association.

“Seriously, I work there? Does anyone else work there?” said Gary Born, a specialist in international arbitration who was surprised to hear when reached by a Washington Post reporter that his picture and biography were on the London Center of International Law Practice’s website.

Whether there is much more to Mifsud than meets the eye — or perhaps much less — will now be a question for Mueller.

In the plea agreement, Papadopoulos depicts Mifsud as a contact eager to help play matchmaker between the Trump team and President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

Mifsud introduces Papadopoulos to a woman he identifies as Putin’s niece, promises top-level Russian meetings for Trump aides and returns from a visit to Moscow offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton based on “thousands of emails” obtained by the Russian government.

The plea agreement makes no direct accusation against Mifsud. But a sworn affidavit from FBI Special Agent Robert Gibbs at least raises the possibility he was a Russian cutout.

“[The] Russian government and its intelligence and security services frequently make use of non-governmental intermediaries to achieve their foreign intelligence objectives,” Gibbs writes. “This structure serves in part to hide the overt involvement of the Russian government.”

Russia, he continues, “has used individuals associated with academia and think tanks in such a capacity.”

Mifsud last week insisted he was “not a secret agent. I never got any money from the Russians.”

[Professor at center of Russia disclosures claimed to have met with Putin ]

But on other points he has been contradictory.

When the indictment was unsealed on Monday, he initially denied that he was the “professor” cited in the court papers. Then on Tuesday he confirmed it, but told London’s Daily Telegraph that the descriptions of his role were “exaggerated” and insisted he had had no contact with Russian officials.

But the same day, The Post reported that he had boasted to his former assistant late last year that he had had a meeting with Putin.

On Wednesday, he told Italy’s La Repubblica that Papadopoulos’s claims about him in the indictment were “nonsense.”

“I strongly deny any discussion about secrets concerning Hillary Clinton,” he said. “I swear it on my daughter.”

But then, minutes later, he related that he had been in Moscow during the presidential campaign and had had a conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He also said he was in touch with officials at Russian think tanks that are considered close to the Kremlin and the Foreign Ministry.

As for the alleged niece of Putin, Mifsud laughed off the suggestion that she was related to the Russian president. “She’s just a student,” he said. “A very good-looking one.”

Mifsud also told La Repubblica that he had been speaking with the FBI.

Mifsud has not responded to calls or emails from The Post.

To former colleagues in his native Malta, Mifsud’s sudden entrance into the center of the world’s most-watched investigation is a surprise. But not a total one.

“He’s a charmer,” said Dominic Fenech, a dean at the University of Malta.

Mifsud was once a lecturer in education at the university. But Fenech and other colleagues said his interest in the normal preoccupations of academics — research, publishing and teaching — was minimal.

[Paul Manafort’s ‘lavish lifestyle’ highlighted in indictment]

Instead, Fenech said, Mifsud was more focused on creating international educational partnerships.

One was a for-profit branch of the University of Malta that Mifsud helped to establish in Rome with a senior Italian politician who had been implicated in a series of scandals. The university later withdrew its participation.

Another was the European Union-funded Euro-Mediterranean University in Slovenia. Fenech, a scholar of Mediterranean history, said the school had little to no academic profile.

“To me, frankly, people who get these jobs in these kinds of institutions, well, it often makes me wonder,” he said. “I’m not saying he’s wheeling and dealing. I’m just saying everything’s possible.”

Mifsud left the university under a cloud, with Slovenian government ministers expressing disappointment at the institution’s progress and officials claiming that Mifsud had left behind tens of thousands of euros worth of unexplained expenses.

Mifsud told the Times of Malta when the claims came to light in 2013 that it was “a private matter.”

The university released a statement this week saying its relationship with Mifsud was “completely severed since he has resigned from his post as President of the University in July 2012.”

“In fact,” the statement continued, “following his resignation, the University was unaware of the whereabouts of Mr. Mifsud.”

His whereabouts were mostly in London, though exactly what he was doing there is difficult to pin down.

His roles included professorships at the University of Stirling in Scotland and the University of East Anglia — both of which were associated with the London Academy of Diplomacy, where Mifsud was honorary director.

Andrew Glencross, a politics expert who taught at Stirling between 2013 and 2016, described Mifsud as “personable, congenial” and “an inveterate name dropper in terms of politicians.”

But Mifsud was not a typical professor. The university’s student newspaper reported last week that Mifsud had no office on campus, and it could not find any students who had met him.

“He’s not your run-of-the-mill professor with a large hinterland of research, of teaching, of supervising research students, grant applications . . . no. That was why, from the first instance I was aware of the collaboration with [the London Academy of Diplomacy] I was perplexed about who exactly they were and what they brought to us.”

When the university announced the association in 2014, Glencross said he and his colleagues had never heard of the organization. “They weren’t on the radar.”

Equally perplexing was the London Center of International Law Practice.

The center supposedly operates from a fine Georgian building overlooking a leafy London square.

When a Post reporter buzzed the door on several occasions during business hours last week, no one answered.

Until recently, the staff Web page had 33 people listed on it, including Joseph Mifsud. But the page was deleted on Oct. 23, a week before the Papadopoulos plea agreement was unsealed.

Several of those listed as being part of the “team” were only loosely affiliated — if at all.

Born, the arbitration specialist whose name was listed on the site, said he met once with one of its employees, who pitched him on “a forum for academic and public policy discussions. It was pretty vague and aspirational.” As far as Born knew, nothing came of it.

Another person connected to the center was Papadopoulos, who worked there in the spring of 2016 under the lofty title of director of the Center for International Energy and Natural Resources Law & Security.

It’s unclear whether the center explains how the young Papadopoulos and the middle-aged Mifsud first connected.

But Glencross, the political analyst, speculated that whenever they met, they probably saw in each other kindred spirits.

“[Mifsud] is exactly the type of person who is on the make, or wants to be on the make in foreign policy circles,” he said. “I can see why someone like Papadopoulos, if he wanted to make himself seem more important, he would want to latch on to someone like Joseph.”

Jonathan Lemire / AP,,2017-11-04T15:12:55Z,time,Donald Trump's Asia Trip Presents a Crucial International Test,http://time.com/5010474/donald-trump-asia-trip/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/president-trump-melania-asia.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"(HONOLULU) — On his most grueling and consequential trip abroad, President Donald Trump stands ready to exhort Asian allies and rivals on the need to counter the dangers posed by North Korea’s nuclear threat.

The 12-day, five-country trip, the longest Far East itinerary for a president in a generation, comes at a precarious moment for Trump. Just days ago, his former campaign chairman was indicted and another adviser pleaded guilty as part of an investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials.

With Trump set to arrive Sunday in Japan, the trip presents a crucial international test for a president looking to reassure Asian allies worried that his inward-looking “America First” agenda could cede power in the region to China. They also are rattled by his bellicose rhetoric about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The North’s growing missile arsenal threatens the capitals Trump will visit.

“The trip comes, I would argue, at a very inopportune time for the president. He is under growing domestic vulnerabilities that we all know about, hour to hour,” said Jonathan Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “The conjunction of those issues leads to the palpable sense of unease about the potential crisis in Korea.”

Trump’s spontaneous, and at time reckless, style flies in the face of the generations-old traditions and protocol that govern diplomatic exchanges in Asia. The grand receptions expected for him in Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing and beyond are sure to be lavish attempts to impress the president, who raved about the extravagances shown him on earlier visits to Saudi Arabia and France.

The trip will also put Trump in face-to-face meetings with authoritarian leaders for whom he has expressed admiration. They include China’s Xi Jinping, whom Trump has likened to “a king,” and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte, who has sanctioned the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers.

Trump may also have the chance for a second private audience with Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the sidelines of a summit in Vietnam.

The White House is signaling that Trump will push American economic interests in the region, but the North Korean threat is expected to dominate the trip. One of Trump’s two major speeches will come before the National Assembly in Seoul. Fiery threats against the North could resonate differently than they do from the distance of Washington.

Trump will forgo a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, the stark border between North and South Korea. All U.S. presidents except one since Ronald Reagan have visited the DMZ in a sign of solidarity with Seoul. The White House contends that Trump’s commitment to South Korea is already crystal clear, as evidenced by his war of words with Kim and his threats to deliver “fire and fury” to North Korea if it does not stop threatening American allies.

The escalation of rhetoric, a departure from the conduct of past presidents, has undermined confidence in the U.S. as a stabilizing presence in Asia.

“There’s a danger if there is a lot of muscle flexing,” said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California. “Trump has been going right up to the edge and I wouldn’t rule out some sort of forceful North Korean reaction to Trump’s presence in the region,” he said.

The White House said Trump would be undeterred.

“The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously. That’s been of great reassurance to our allies, partners and others in the region who are literally under the gun of this regime,” White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Thursday. “I don’t think the president really modulates his language, have you noticed?”

At each stop, Trump will urge his hosts to squeeze North Korea by stopping trading with the North and sending home North Korean citizens working abroad. That includes China, which competes with the U.S. for influence in the region and provides much of North Korea’s economic lifeblood.

The White House is banking on the close relationships Trump has established with some Asian leaders to help make his demands more palatable.

Officials acknowledge that Trump does not yet have a feel for Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s newly elected liberal president. But Trump has demonstrated cordial relations with Xi and struck up a friendship with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom he planned to golf on Sunday.

While Xi and Abe have recently tightened their control on power, Trump arrives weakened by low poll numbers, a stalled domestic agenda and the swirling Russia probe.

Many in the Asian capitals will view Trump warily.

His early withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership demolished the Obama administration’s effort to boost trade with some of the world’s fastest-growing economies and sustain America’s post-World War II strategic commitment to Asia.

Trump is expected to outline his economic vision for the region, which includes a preference for one-to-one relationships over multinational agreements, during a speech at a summit in Vietnam. He is not expected to offer any concrete economic policy changes while in Asia, though some new contracts for American businesses may be announced.

His administration’s eager embrace of a deeper strategic partnership with India and other democracies across the Pacific risks alienating China and Pakistan. The White House did, at the last minute, extend the trip for an extra day so Trump could attend the East Asia Summit in the Philippines.

At the same time, Trump can point to some early successes in Asia.

He won Beijing’s support for the toughest international sanctions yet on North Korea. Tensions in the disputed South China Sea that escalated as China conducted a massive land-reclamation effort on Obama’s watch have ebbed. Long-standing U.S. alliances with Thailand and the Philippines have been repaired by engaging their authoritarian leaders and sidelining human rights concerns, though the White House suggested Trump may chide Duterte privately.

“How much does it help to yell about these problems?” McMaster said.

The White House hopes the trip could offer a chance at a reset as a tumultuous first year in office winds down. Trump’s advisers see it as an opportunity for the president to forcefully assert U.S. pledges to its allies and deliver a fierce warning directly to North Korea’s Kim, whom he has belittled as “little Rocket Man.”

Trump’s trip will be the longest Asia visit for any U.S. president since George H.W. Bush went there in 1992, when he fell ill during a state dinner with Japan’s prime minister.

Before he left Hawaii, Trump had his motorcade stop at the Trump International Hotel Waikiki because, as White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders put it, the president “wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work.” Trump didn’t stay at the hotel during his one night in Hawaii."
Deb Riechmann and Alanna Durkin Richer / AP,,2017-11-04T12:10:33Z,time,'Totally Unfounded.' JFK Files Say No Evidence of Harvey Oswald Link to CIA,http://time.com/5010320/jfk-files-cia/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/jfk-files-oswald.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"(WASHINGTON) — Newly released government documents regarding John F. Kennedy’s assassination say allegations that Lee Harvey Oswald was connected to the CIA were “totally unfounded.”

A 1975 CIA memo says a thorough search of agency records in and outside the United States was conducted to determine whether Oswald had been used by the agency or connected with it in “any conceivable way.”

The memo said the search came up empty. The memo also said there was also no indication that any other U.S. agency used Oswald as a source or for recruitment.

The National Archives released another 676 government documents related to the assassination on Friday — the third public release so far this year. Under law, all the documents were to be disclosed to the public last week.

Most of the latest release comprises 553 records from the CIA that previously were withheld in their entirety. There also are records from the Justice and Defense departments, the House Select Committee on Assassinations and the National Archives.

University of Virginia historian Larry Sabato complained that many of the documents in the latest release were still heavily redacted. He tweeted about a 144-page record, titled “Material Reviewed at CIA headquarters by House Select Committee on Assassinations staff members,” that had writing on only a handful of pages.

President Donald Trump has ordered the release of all records related to the assassination, and they are expected to be made public on a rolling basis during the next three to four weeks. He also directed agencies to take another look at redactions and withhold information only in the rarest of circumstances.

One record showed how U.S. officials scrambled after the assassination to round up information about Oswald’s trip to Mexico City weeks earlier. Officials wondered whether Oswald had been trying to get visas at the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City in order to “make a quick escape after assassinating the president.”

A CIA message sent Nov. 24, 1963 — two days after Kennedy was killed — said an “important question” that remained unsolved was whether Oswald had been planning to travel right away or return to the U.S. and leave later.

The message said that although it appeared Oswald “was then thinking only about a peaceful change of residence to the Soviet Union, it is also possible that he was getting documented to make a quick escape after assassinating the president.”

Another record dated April 11, 1964, recounted a visit to the CIA by three staff members of the Warren Commission, which was set up to investigate the assassination.

The memo said the staff members indicated that Thomas Mann, former ambassador to Mexico and then-assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, “still has the ‘feeling in his guts’ that (Cuban leader Fidel) Castro hired Oswald to kill Kennedy. They said, however, that the commission has not been able to get any proof of that.”

Also in the latest release was a 20-page FBI analysis of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. dated March 12, 1968 — a month before he was assassinated on April 4, 1968. One section alleges that King was attracted to former members of the Communist Party in America. It notes that two previous aides were party members and eight others, who helped shape King’s organization in its early stages, had communist affiliations.

The analysis said that in the early 1960s, the Communist Party was trying to get a black labor coalition to further its goals in the United States. It referenced a May 1961 issue of a communist newspaper that stated, “Communists will do their utmost to strengthen and unite the Negro movement and ring it to the backing of the working people.”

The FBI said King and his organization were “made-to-order” to achieve these objectives.

The FBI’s surveillance of King is well-known and the analysis includes several pages about his sexual life. One document said a black minister who attended a workshop to train ministers in February 1968 in Miami “expressed his disgust with the behind-the-scene drinking, fornication and homosexuality that went on at the conference.”

“Throughout the ensuing years and until this date, King has continued to carry on his sexual aberrations secretly while holding himself out to public view as a moral leader of religious conviction,” the FBI report said."
Zeina Karam / AP,,2017-11-04T10:07:37Z,time,Lebanese Prime Minister Suggests He Fears for His Life During Resignation,http://time.com/5010261/lebanese-prime-minister-resigns/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/lebanese-prime-minister.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"(BEIRUT) — Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri resigned from his post Saturday during a trip to Saudi Arabia in a surprise move that plunged the country into uncertainty amid heightened regional tensions.

In a televised address from Riyadh, Hariri fired a vicious tirade against Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah group for what he said was their meddling in Arab affairs and said “Iran’s arms in the region will be cut off.”

“The evil that Iran spreads in the region will backfire on it,” Hariri said, accusing Tehran of spreading chaos, strife and destruction throughout the region.

Hariri was appointed prime minister in late 2016 and headed a 30-member national unity cabinet that included the Shiite militant Hezbollah. The government has largely succeeded in protecting the country from the effects of the civil war in neighboring Syria.

The country is sharply divided along a camp loyal to Saudi Arabia, headed by the Sunni Muslim Hariri, and a camp loyal to Iran represented by Hezbollah. President Michel Aoun, who was elected in October 2016 after more than two years of presidential vacuum, is a close ally of Hezbollah.

His election was made possible after Hariri endorsed him for president, based on an understanding that Aoun would then appoint him as prime minister.

In a statement, the presidential office said Aoun was informed by Hariri in a phone call of his resignation, adding that the president now awaits Hariri’s return to the country to clarify the circumstances of his resignation and proceed accordingly.

Hariri’s bombshell resignation Saturday was expected to raise tensions in the country and ushers in a stage of deep uncertainty and potential instability. It comes amid a sharp escalation in Saudi rhetoric against its regional archrival Iran.

In his speech, he suggested he feared for his life and said the climate in the country is similar to the one that existed before his father, the late prime minister Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in 2005.

Several Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia for the killing by a U.N.-backed tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. Hezbollah denies any involvement.

Hezbollah has sent thousands of its fighters to Syria to shore up President Bashar Assad’s government. The group’s intervention in Syria is highly controversial in Lebanon.

Hariri said Hezbollah’s policies have put Lebanon “in the eye of the storm.” His attacks on Hezbollah come on the heels of new U.S. sanctions on the group that many fear will impact negatively on the Lebanese economy.

“Hezbollah was able in past decades to impose a reality in Lebanon by force of arms directed at the chests of Syrians and Lebanese,” he said.

“I declare my resignation from the premiership of the Lebanese government, with the certainty that the will of the Lebanese is strong,” Hariri said.

“When I took office, I promised you that I would seek to unite the Lebanese, end political division and establish the principle of self-sufficiency, but I have been unable to do so. Despite my efforts, Iran continues to abuse Lebanon,” he said.

Earlier this week, Saudi State Minister for Gulf Affairs Thamer al-Sabhan sharply criticized Hezbollah, calling for its “toppling” and promising “astonishing developments” in the coming days during an interview with the Lebanese TV station MTV.

Al-Sabhan met with Hariri in Saudi Arabia when the now resigned prime minister was visiting earlier this week. Hariri abruptly returned to the kingdom later Friday before his bombshell announcement Saturday.

In tweets after meeting Hariri, al-Sabhan described it as “long and fruitful meeting” that resulted in agreements over many issues that concern the Lebanese. “What’s coming is better, God willing,” al-Sabhan tweeted on Tuesday. In a series of tweets, al-Sabhan criticized the Lebanese government for tolerating Hezbollah’s criticism of the kingdom.

He earlier said that those who cooperate with Hezbollah must be “punished.”"

Los Angeles officials named Nov. 3 “Selena Day.”

Selena’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star is the 2,622nd and is placed right in front of Capitol Records’ building — located on Vine Street north of Hollywood Boulevard — where the singer visited often after signing with EMI Latin, USA Today reported.

The ceremony debuting the late singer’s Hollywood star featured Selena’s sister Suzette Quintanilla Arriaga and actress Eva Longoria, according to USA Today.

Longoria spoke about the path Selena forged for Latinas in entertainment.

“Growing up there was no reflection of me on TV or in music and that all changed with Selena y Los Dinos. Selena was a small town girl with a big heart … and that small town was my hometown, Corpus Christi, Texas,” Longoria said at the event, according to the report.

Selena was recently featured as one of Google’s Doodles to mark the 28th anniversary of her first studio album. Last year, Madame Tussauds debuted a wax figure of Selena in Hollywood and MAC Cosmetics released a line inspired by the singer.

Selena was shot and killed by the former president of her fan club, Yolanda Saldívar, in 1995."
Jamie Ducharme,,2017-11-04T06:00:16Z,time,The Reason Some States Don't Observe Daylight Saving Time,http://time.com/5005600/states-without-daylight-savings-time/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/grand-canyon-arizona.jpeg?quality=85,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"For something as simple as turning the clock back (or forward) an hour, Daylight Saving Time (DST) is awfully polarizing.

So why does Daylight Saving Time (sometimes mistakenly referred to as Daylight Savings Time) even exist, and why do some states not participate in the biannual ritual? It turns out Daylight Saving Time started out nearly a century ago, way back in March 1918. It was officially pitched as a way to save fuel during World War I. In reality, it was also a means of luring people out into the extended daylight hours to shop, attend sporting events and spend time outdoors, author Michael Downing argues in his book Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time. Today, though, more and more states are arguing that the concept is outdated, and some are even considering dropping it altogether.

Two U.S. states and several territories don’t do Daylight Saving, and a Massachusetts commission is currently campaigning for the Commonwealth, and possibly the rest of New England and New York, to move into the Atlantic time zone, effectively ending Daylight Savings Time there by permanently turning the clocks an hour ahead. Proponents argue that the switch could mediate some of the economic and health consequences that come with decreased daylight — including upticks in traffic accidents, heart attacks, workplace injuries and crime — while improving quality of life during dark fall and winter months. States across the country, from Alaska to Texas to Florida, have floated similar ideas.

Only time will tell if Massachusetts moves forward with the plan, joining these states that do not observe Daylight Savings Time.

Most of Arizona hasn’t observed Daylight Saving Time since 1968, when the state legislature opted out of 1966’s Uniform Time Act, which regulates time zones and DST. Why? Thanks to its location, the state gets plenty of daylight — and heat — all year round, USA Today reports. Ignoring Daylight Saving Time helps keep temperatures down during waking hours, cuts back on energy usage and syncs bedtimes with the light outside.

Interestingly, a bill that circulated in 2015 would have restored Daylight Saving Time in Arizona, citing economic difficulties related to the discrepancy with other states. The bill had support from some lawmakers, Tuscon.com reports, but ultimately didn’t pass.

But while most of the state doesn’t observe Daylight Saving Time, the Navajo Nation, which covers a large swath of northeastern Arizona, still switches its clocks twice a year. That’s because it extends into Utah and New Mexico, which still use Daylight Saving Time, according to Conde Nast Traveler.

Hawaii

Hawaii abandoned the Uniform Time Act a year before Arizona, in 1967, simply because of its relative proximity to the equator, which makes Daylight Saving Time unnecessary. The sun rises and sets around the same time each day in Hawaii, making the idea of springing forward and falling back redundant.

A handful of U.S. territories also don’t observe Daylight Saving Time for essentially the same reasons as Hawaii — ample sunshine throughout the day. These places include Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands."

The American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro said that Rosa Maria Hernandez was returned to her family Friday. Her parents brought her into the U.S. from Mexico in 2007, when she was a toddler, and they live in the Texas border city of Laredo.

A cousin who is an American citizen took Rosa Maria from Laredo to a children’s hospital in Corpus Christi on Oct. 24, where she was scheduled to have emergency gallbladder surgery. To get to Corpus Christi, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) away, she had to pass through an interior checkpoint in South Texas operated by the Border Patrol.

Border Patrol agents followed Rosa Maria and the cousin to the hospital, then took the girl into custody after the surgery and transported her to a facility in San Antonio for unaccompanied immigrant minors, under the custody of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The Border Patrol has said it had no choice but to detain Rosa Maria, arguing that she was considered an unaccompanied minor under federal law, the same as a child who crosses into the United States alone without legal permission.

The ACLU sued the government on Rosa Maria’s behalf Tuesday, argued that the U.S. government violated federal law on unaccompanied minors and endangered Rosa Maria’s health by not sending her home.

“She never should have been in this situation in the first place,” ACLU lawyer Michael Tan said Friday. “There is no reason Border Patrol had to target a child.”

While Rosa Maria has been reunited with her family, she still faces the threat of deportation. Tan said Friday that Border Patrol agents had issued Rosa Maria a notice to appear in immigration court, but that the case had yet to move forward.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the Border Patrol, declined to comment. HHS declined to comment on Rosa Maria’s case, but said the agency’s focus was “on the safety and best interest of each child.”

Leticia Gonzalez, an attorney for Rosa Maria’s family, said the 10-year-old had the mental capacity of a child closer to 4 or 5 years old due to her cerebral palsy. Priscila Martinez, an activist at the Workers Defense Action Fund, said the child had started to show signs of socially withdrawing while in detention and refusing to eat her favorite kind of bread.

Federal immigration authorities have faced strong criticism from advocates and some Texas Democratic congressmen over their handling of the case.

Castro, a San Antonio Democrat, said Friday that he had tried to see Rosa Maria earlier in the day and had spoken to federal officials about her case. He said Border Patrol agents could have chosen to let Rosa Maria pass through the checkpoint without following or detaining her.

“Staking out the hospital room of a young, sick girl and keeping her away from her family is not a humane treatment for her,” Castro said.

But U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a previous statement after she was detained that “there is no discretion with regard to the law whether or not the agents should enforce the law.”

Gabriel Acosta, assistant chief patrol agent for the Border Patrol’s Laredo sector, said Tuesday that his agents moved quickly to get her through the checkpoint and “acted professionally and compassionately to get this child the medical attention she needed.”"
Andrew Dalton / AP,,2017-11-04T09:28:24Z,time,Netflix Pulls Kevin Spacey from <i>House of Cards</i>,http://time.com/5010243/kevin-spacey-house-of-cards/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kevin-spacey-netflix-cards.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"(LOS ANGELES) — Netflix said Friday night that Kevin Spacey will no longer be a part of “House of Cards” and it’s cutting all other ties with the actor after a series of allegations of sexual harassment and assault.

“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of ‘House of Cards’ that includes Kevin Spacey,” the company said in a statement.

Netflix said it will work with the show’s production company MRC to evaluate whether it will continue without him.

The 58-year-old Spacey was nominated for best drama actor Emmy Awards during each of the show’s first five seasons, but never won. He played a ruthless politician who ascends to the presidency of the United States. Co-star Robin Wright is also a central player on the show, and it could conceivably continue with a focus on her.

Production on the show had already been suspended on Tuesday.

Netflix says it also will refuse to release the film “Gore,” in which Spacey stars as the writer Gore Vidal and also acted as producer.

CNN reported that eight current or former “House of Cards” workers claim that Spacey made the production a “toxic” workplace and one ex-employee alleges the actor sexually assaulted him.

Spacey has not been arrested or charged with any crime. His publicist did not immediately return an email message late Friday night seeking comment. A publicist said earlier this week that Spacey is “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.”

The Academy Award-winning actor became ensnared in Hollywood’s fast-growing sexual harassment crisis after actor Anthony Rapp alleged Spacey made sexual advances toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. Spacey has said he doesn’t remember the alleged encounter reported by BuzzFeed News last weekend but apologized if such “drunken behavior” occurred.

The story spurred several others to come forward with similar allegations about Spacey.

London police are reportedly investigating Spacey for a 2008 sexual assault, British media reported Friday.

Police did not identify Spacey by name but said the department’s child abuse and sexual offenses unit is investigating the reported assault after it was referred to police earlier this week.

Spacey is the latest high profile Hollywood figure to lose work and standing in a wave that began when dozens of sexual harassment allegations were reported last month against film mogul Harvey Weinstein.

Weinstein is under investigation in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, London and New York for possible criminal cases after several women accused him of sexual assault or rape.

Also Friday, Hamilton Fish, publisher of The New Republic, resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment.

In a company memo shared with The Associated Press, magazine owner Win McCormack wrote that Fish’s resignation was effective immediately and that an internal investigation would continue. Fish, who joined The New Republic in 2016, had been placed on leave of absence last week. He is a former publisher of The Nation.

“As I understand it, some employees, to my deep dismay, complained this week that my presence had led them to feel uncomfortable at The New Republic,” Fish wrote to McCormack in a memo Friday that was also shared with the AP. “Women have longstanding and profound concerns with respect to their treatment in the workplace. Many men have a lot to learn in this regard. I know I do, and I hope for and encourage that new direction.”

Fish wrote in an email to the AP that he “felt the controversy swirling around us could cause irreparable harm to the magazine, and that the only way to protect The New Republic and its employees was for me to separate from the organization.” Noting his time with such organizations as The Nation, a prominent liberal publication, and with Human Rights Watch, he wrote that he had spent his career in “in progressive media and the human rights field.

Fish is among several figures in media and publishing that have stepped down or been fired in the wake of the Weinstein reports.

Others include author and former NBC analyst Mark Halperin, former New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier and former NPR chief editor Michael Oreskes, who was an AP executive from 2008 to 2015."

“Earlier this year we initiated a call for ideas on the future of the Rizzo statue,” Michael DiBerardinis, managing director for the city of Philadelphia, said in a statement. “We carefully reviewed and considered everyone’s viewpoints and we have come to the decision that the Rizzo statue will be moved to a different location.”

Protesters, who say Rizzo oppressed the black community when he worked as Philadelphia police commissioner in the 1960s, had called for the removal of the statue, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. DiBerardinis didn’t address the protests in his statement, but said the removal is part of preliminary stages of redoing the public space.

“Our goal moving forward is to seamlessly relocate the statue to a new, more appropriate public location in the city,” he said.

Talk of removing the statue began when City Councilwoman Helen Gym tweeted in August, calling for Rizzo’s statue to be removed amid protests in Charlottesville, Va., over Robert E. Lee’s statue, according to the Post-Gazette.

Frank Rizzo Jr., who previously sat on the City Council, told the Post-Gazette that he does not plan to object to the decision, but that people should remember the moment during the the 2019 election.

“I’ve been around politics all my life,” Rizzo told the newspaper. “I don’t think there’s a reason to raise an objection, other than [to note] the supporters of Frank Rizzo remember this on Election Day.”

Rizzo served as mayor from 1972 to 1980. He died in 1991, and the statue was erected in 1999. It is unclear when the statue will be removed or where it will be relocated."

Police in Portland, Texas, arrested Phillips around 1:30 a.m. Friday. Jail records show the “La Bamba” star was freed after posting bail, which had been set at $2,500.

Police Chief Mark Cory says an officer was conducting an unrelated traffic stop when the 55-year-old Phillips drove up and asked for directions. The officer suspected Phillips had been drinking.

Cory says Phillips’ blood alcohol level was .20 percent — more than twice the legal limit for driving.

Cory says Phillips, who listed a California address, was cooperative.

Jail records listed no attorney for Phillips, a 1980 graduate of Corpus Christi’s Flour Bluff High School."
Jonathan Lemire / AP,,2017-11-04T10:36:09Z,time,President Donald Trump Makes Solemn Visit to Pearl Harbor,http://time.com/5010260/donald-trump-pearl-harbor/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/trump-pearl-harbor.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-05 03:02:16.294154,"(JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM, Hawaii) — President Donald Trump paid a solemn visit to the memorial at Pearl Harbor, a sacred journey for a commander-in-chief about to depart on an Asia trip that will be shadowed by fears of another international conflict.

Trump saluted Friday after entering the USS Arizona memorial following a short boat ride with first lady Melania Trump. They approached a wreath of white flowers — a gift from the couple — and watched as two sailors who stood beside it at attention placed the wreath near a wall of names of the fallen.

The Trumps then tossed white flower petals into the waters above the battleship’s sunken hull, as the president then peered down where the rusted wreckage is visible at the water’s surface.

Nearly 1,200 crew members died on the USS Arizona during the December 7, 1941 surprise attack by Japan that plunged the U.S. into World War II.

Trump, who had spoken earlier in the day about being eager to see the sacred site for the first time, appeared moved by the visit. As the wreath was quietly placed into position, Trump crossed his arms in front of him, closing his eyes as he bowed his head in remembrance.

As the sun began to fade over the Pacific, Trump then listened intently to a National Park Service tour guide, stopping briefly at a display that explained how some survivors of the attack, when they die years later, have chosen to be cremated and have their ashes placed in the sunken ship alongside the remains of their fallen colleagues.

Trump said not a word about North Korea or its nuclear ambitions on Friday, the eve of his first official visit to Asia. He will arrive in Japan on Sunday morning, the first of five countries he will visit over 11 days as he exhorts Asian allies to increase pressure on Pyongyang to abandon its deadly ambitions.

Hawaii acted as a sort of midway point on Trump’s trip halfway around the world. He arrived at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam Friday after a daylong flight from Washington.

The president quickly donned a lei after he left Air Force One with his wife, who also wore a wreath of flowers. He signed autographs and gave high-fives to kids who were among a group of civilians and service members that gathered for the arrival.

Trump wasn’t the only attraction to arrive on base. A few in the crowd shouted their admiration for White House chief of staff John Kelly.

“We love you Gen. Kelly,” one person shouted at the retired four-star Marine general who stood several feet behind the president.

Trump was briefed by leaders of the U.S. Pacific Command. The growing threat from North Korea — a crisis that will shadow the entire trip — was expected to be among the topics discussed. Trump was also meeting with the governors of Alaska, Hawaii and Pacific U.S. territories, all potential targets of any successful attempt by North Korea to strike the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped missile.

“We are going to visit very shortly, Pearl Harbor, which I’ve read about, spoken about, heard about, studied, but I haven’t seen. And that is going to be very exciting for me,” Trump said at the start of a briefing with leaders of the U.S. Pacific Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the region.

The USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor marks the final resting place of more than 1,000 sailors and Marines who were killed on the battleship during the surprise attack on what President Franklin Roosevelt deemed “a date which we live in infamy.” Accessible only by boat, the memorial straddles the ship’s sunken hull.

A total of more than 2,300 sailors, soldiers and Marines died as a result of the attack, as well as 68 civilians, according to the National Park Service.

The visit to the memorial comes soon after Trump was embroiled in a controversy over his attempt to console the grieving families of America’s war dead. The family of one of the four soldiers killed in a Niger ambush last month said the president disrespected them when he called to offer a condolences, a charge Trump vehemently denied.

And The Associated Press discovered that a number of families of soldiers killed since Trump took office had not received a call from the president, despite his claim that he had called nearly all of them."
