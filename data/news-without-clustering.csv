The number of Americans with flood insurance is on the rise, yet Hurricane Florence is likely to make it painfully clear that too many homeowners in the Carolinas and other vulnerable regions remain unprotected. .

An analysis of federal flood insurance records by The Associated Press found there were roughly 5.1 million active flood insurance policies in the U.S. as of July 31, up from 4.94 million a year earlier.

The Carolinas had modest gains — a 2.5 percent increase in South Carolina and a 3.5 percent increase in North Carolina.

But large gaps in coverage remain. South Carolina is the second-highest insured state for flooding, with roughly 65 percent of properties in flood hazard areas insured. But in North Carolina, where forecasters say the storm might bring the most destructive round of flooding in state history, flood coverage is less common, with only 35 percent of at-risk properties insured.

After blowing ashore as a hurricane with 90 mph (145 kph) winds, Florence virtually parked itself much of the weekend atop the Carolinas as it pulled warm water from the ocean and hurled it onshore. Storm surges, flash floods and winds scattered destruction widely.

Most of the gains observed in the federal flood insurance data over the past 12 months occurred in Texas, with about 145,000 new policies. Insurance experts say that Hurricane Harvey, which brought tremendous flood damage to Texas and Louisiana late last summer, helped increase public awareness that homeowners need flood insurance.

""That's terrific. Nothing sells flood insurance like a storm,"" said Robert Hunter, who ran the National Flood Insurance Program in the 1970s.

Still, federal officials say there are too many Americans in vulnerable areas who lack flood insurance — even after storms such as Sandy, Matthew and Harvey caused widespread property damage and financial losses with storm surge and rainfall. A look at the five-year and 10-year trends shows a decline in the number of flood insurance policies nationwide.

Property insurance typically doesn't cover flooding, and flood insurance remains by and large a federal government program run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA.

FEMA requires most homeowners with mortgages living in certain designated areas to buy flood insurance. But there are numerous neighborhoods across the U.S. that are vulnerable to flooding but where insurance isn't mandatory and many residents choose not to enroll — sometimes with dire consequences.

In the five years before Hurricane Harvey walloped Houston last year, for instance, the number of homes covered in the city dropped 11 percent. The monster storm ended up flooding more than 150,000 homes in the area, leaving many people digging into their savings to repair their houses.

Data show that even with the increase in flood insurance coverage over the past year, the number of homes covered is down 3 percent in North Carolina and 6 percent South Carolina compared with five years ago.

Researchers and insurance experts say many Americans choose not to get flood insurance because of a belief that flooding will not happen to them, or if it does, federal disaster assistance cover their losses.

But federal disaster relief typically consists of low-interest loans — money that must be repaid. The maximum amount of disaster assistance available to an individual or household is $34,000, which is typically not enough to cover repairs caused by flooding. The average damage caused by flooding during Harvey was around $80,000, according to the Texas Department of Insurance.

""We have been working for the last couple years to close the insurance gap, but still not near enough people have necessary coverage. We still have a lot of work to do,"" said David Maursted, the current director of the government's flood insurance program, in a conference call with reporters on Thursday.

Because Hurricane Florence hit the Carolina coast as a less powerful Category 1 storm, damages are expected to be less severe than originally estimated. Property data company CoreLogic estimates the storm surge and wind from Florence will cause roughly $3 billion to $5 billion in damages.

But the potential property damage in the Carolinas could once again strain the financial health of the nation's flood insurance program.

Starting with Katrina in 2005, a series of catastrophic storms have forced the program to pay out billions of dollars more in claims than it receives in premiums. Last year, the damages from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma caused the program to reach its $30.5 billion statutory limit on borrowing.

In renewing the flood insurance program's mandate last year, Congress forgave roughly $16 billion in the program's debt. But the program is still roughly $20.5 billion in the red, according to FEMA.

Maursted said NFIP insurance companies are already deploying claims agents and adjusters to the area and they do not expect any delays in processing claims. Policyholders who have flood insurance should file a claim with their insurance company as soon as they feel it's safe enough to do so.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said door-to-door inspections conducted in the aftermath of Thursday's gas explosions in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover were expected to wrap up Saturday night and all residents should be able to return home at 7 a.m. Sunday morning.

There are at least 12 families whose homes were destroyed who will not be able to return home, officials said.

They've done inspections on more than 5,000 residences and turned the power back on to all of them.

AP

National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt said Saturday the explosions did not appear to be ""nefarious"" or ""intentional.""

Baker declared a state of emergency and removed Columbia Gas, which operated the gas lines, from inspecting the homes after saying they were not able to live up to the task. The governor had the Department of Public Safety install fellow energy supplier Eversource to conduct the testing. About 100 technicians from the company began going door-to-door checking homes Friday night.

Baker said Eversource was put in charge ""after it became clear to us that Columbia Gas was simply inadequately prepared to take the steps necessary to effectively manage relief efforts.""

WCVB/AP

""The only reason we're in this state is because we got asked by Columbia Gas to do two very important things: first, evacuate everyone. 'Are you sure you evacuated everyone south of the river?' 'Yes.' So we did it,"" Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera said Friday at a press conference with Baker. ""The second thing they asked us to do was shut off the power. 'Are you sure?' 'Yes, shut off the power.' Those are the last two coherent pieces of information we got from Columbia Gas. Everything since then has been obfuscation and they've not met their mandate.

""They've promised hundreds of teams of technicians. None have materialized,"" he added.

WCVB/AP

Leonel Rondon, 18, was killed after one of the explosions sent a chimney crashing onto his car, Massachusetts State Police said. Rondon had received his driver's license the same day, his friend Anthony Gil told ABC News. Twelve others were injured in the explosions and fires.

Columbia Gas has been fined $100,000 over the past seven years by the state of Massachusetts for violations, including improper pressure testing, according to Boston ABC affiliate WCVB.

Lawrence, Andover and North Andover are about 30 miles north of Boston, near the New Hampshire border.

The incident happened about noon when the man was swimming at Newcomb Hollow Beach in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, police said.

He was pulled from the water, given first aid and taken to Cape Cod Hospital, where he died, police said.

The man suffered ""injuries to his lower extremities,"" an off-duty lifeguard told The Cape Cod Times.

The victim's was identified by the Cape and Islands district attorney's office as 26-year-old Arthur Medici of Revere, Massachusetts, on Boston's North Shore.

One beachgoer filmed lifeguards and emergency personnel taking the injured man off the beach on a stretcher.

""Witnesses at the scene told officers the victim and another male were about 30 yards off the beach boogie boarding when the attack occurred,"" the district attorney's office said.

Typhoon Mangkhut, known locally as Ompong, made landfall in Cagayan province on northeast Luzon island at 1:40 a.m. local time, according to the country's weather agency, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. It's estimated that the tropical cyclone put at least five million people at risk.

Mangkhut, considered the strongest storm on the planet so far this year, was the 15th to hit the Philippines. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center U.S. Navy-U.S. Air Force command, located in Hawaii, had downgraded Mangkhut from a ""super typhoon,"" when it had peak wind speeds of 180 mph, prior to landfall on the country's largest and most populous island.

Mangkhut weakened slightly as it reached Luzon's mountainous coastline early Saturday morning; however, it was still packing winds equivalent to a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.

Its tropical storm-force winds extended 550 miles across, according to the country's weather agency, making it nearly double the size of Florence, the hurricane-turned-tropical storm that made landfall over the southeastern United States on Friday.

Dept. of Transportation via Reuters

Mangkhut's high winds churned rough seas as it moved across Luzon, producing waves nearly 30 feet high, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The heavy rain triggered landslides that reportedly claimed the lives of several people in the area.

Francis Tolentino, an adviser to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, said at least 12 people died, mostly due to landslides, according to The Associated Press.

Images from hard-hit areas in Cagayan province show countless downed trees and toppled power lines, blown out buildings and debris strewn across roadways.

Global nonprofit Oxfam said it deployed teams of responders to the area to assess the damage and provide disaster relief.

""The situation is very bad,"" Oxfam's April Abello-Bulanadi said in a statement from Tuguegarao City. ""The winds are howling and we can feel the destructive force of Ompong. The roof of the hotel where the response team convened has been blown away. We are on the third floor. The walls and ceiling are shaking. It has been raining nonstop.""

Mangkhut has been tracked northwestward at about 16 mph over the past six hours, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.

The cyclone is forecast to make another landfall over southeastern China, just west of Hong Kong on Sunday, and will ultimately dissipate over the rugged terrain.

Christopher Matthew Clements, 36, was indicted on Friday by a grand jury on 21 criminal counts, including murder and kidnapping charges in the deaths of 6-year-old Isabel Celis and 13-year-old Maribel Gonzalez, Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus said.

Celis went missing from her Tucson home in April 2012, and her body was discovered in what was described as a rural area in March 2017.

Gonzalez' body was discovered in June 2014 in the Avra Valley community near Tucson, not far from where Celis' remains would be found three years later.

Magnus and other officials held a news conference to announce the indictment. But they declined to answer questions from reporters and did not disclose how the girls died or what prompted authorities to investigate Clements in the killings, except to say that the FBI in 2017 learned Clements might have information about the death of Celis.

He then provided information to authorities that led to the discovery of Celis' remains, Magnus said. Investigators later discovered additional pieces of evidence, but they did not describe Saturday what they had found.

Clements had already been in a Phoenix-area jail for more than a year facing other charges when the indictment was issued.

Pima County Attorney Barbara LaWall called the identification of Clements as the killer of the girls ""long overdue.""

""The heart-wrenching tragedies of Maribel Gonzalez and Isabel Celis' murders have been compounded by a very long, long wait for justice,"" she said.

Celis' father reported the girl missing on the morning of April 21, 2012, after he went to her bedroom and she was not there.

Police previously did not name suspects, but they said they found ""suspicious circumstances around a possible entry point"" into the home.

A medical examiner last year ruled Isabel Celis' death as ""homicide by unspecified means."" A heavily redacted autopsy report did not indicate how she died.

Gonzalez went missing on her way to a friend's house. Her body was found days later.

Clements made his first court appearance Saturday morning. He does not yet have an attorney but will be assigned one at a Sept. 24 arraignment.

Clements was being held on a $2 million bond, Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan said.

Clements was jailed in April 2017 on suspicion of burglary, theft and fraudulent schemes, Maricopa County Sheriff's Sgt. Bryant Vanegas said Saturday. Vanegas did not have information about when Clements might be transferred to southern Arizona to face charges in the case of the girl's killings.

The indictment made public Saturday did not provide any details about how the girls were killed or what evidence linked Clements to the killings. It said he was also charged with burglary, theft and possession or distribution of child pornography in other cases dating from 2012 through 2016.

Clements was charged and convicted in Oregon in 1998 of sex-related crimes and was required to register as a sex offender. He was charged and convicted in 2006 in Bay City, Florida, for failing to register, according to Florida law enforcement records.

He was also charged in 2008 in Tucson with failing to register as a sex offender. He was convicted and sentenced to serve 46 months in prison and five years of supervised release

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that sentence in 2011, finding that the federal law requiring him to register as a sex offender within three days of moving to a new home was passed after his 1998 conviction and therefore did not apply to his crime.","the

But in a departure from the administration's approach during the 2017 hurricane season, the White House has largely avoided traditional on-camera briefings to communicate with the broader public and take questions from journalists. Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders held just one public briefing in the lead-up to Florence -- on Monday, Sept. 10.

Ahead of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in 2017, Sanders invited Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert to brief reporters both before and after the storm's landfall in what became routine appearances through the rest of hurricane season, particularly during Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Bossert briefed a total of five times, in addition to several briefings where Sanders took questions on ongoing relief efforts. Bossert departed the White House in April and is now a contributor for ABC News. His replacement, Doug Fears, has not appeared publicly or taken questions.

Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images

The lack of press briefings has limited journalists' ability to publicly hold the administration accountable for its preparations for the storm, inquire about the president's involvement and leadership in response efforts, and address the extraordinary Trump assertion Thursday accusing Democrats of inflating the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.

The near abandonment of the use of on-camera briefings also marks a continuation of a trend in the West Wing's apparent communications strategy. During the summer months of June, July and August, Sanders held just 13 press briefings, according to ABC's analysis -- the fewest during a summer in recent memory.

(MORE: The summer of disappearing White House press briefings)

Asked by ABC News about the absence of traditional White House press briefings around the storm, administration officials said they wanted FEMA and administrator Brock Long to take the lead on informing reporters and the public on Hurricane Florence. The officials would not explain the change in approach from last year or why they declined to answer questions about the president's statements publicly.

Sanders' briefing on Sept. 10 marked the end of a 19-day streak without a single on-camera briefing, though the majority of time was devoted to a presentation by Council of Economic Advisers chairman Kevin Hassett that sought to dispute arguments that President Trump wasn't largely responsible for the strength in the U.S. economy. Sanders only fielded reporters' questions for a total of 18 minutes, with topics ranging from North Korea, journalist Bob Woodward's new book on the administration and the anonymous administration official who penned an op-ed in the New York Times.

The president has also spoken several times regarding the storm, including after he received an Oval Office briefing on the storm on Tuesday from Long and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

On Wednesday the president posted a video message from the Rose Garden warning residents to not ""play games"" and heed evacuation orders from local officials.

""We’re fully prepared, food, medical, everything you can imagine we are ready,"" Trump said. ""But despite that, bad things can happen when you’re talking about a storm of this size. It’s called Mother Nature, you never know, but we know.""

The White House press office has also sent periodic updates through the week via its email list, including calls the president has held with state and local officials and pictures of the president and Vice President Pence receiving a briefing in the Oval Office and with the National Security Council Resilience Directorate. Though neither of those meetings was originally listed on the president's public schedule.

On Friday, as Hurricane Florence made its way inland in North and South Carolina, President Trump again had no events open to the press on his public schedule and instead used his Twitter to retweet more than 20 different tweets from federal and state accounts providing constant updates on the storm's developments.","department of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen

Botham Jean was shot and killed by Police Officer Amber Guyger in his apartment earlier this month.

""We're here eight days after his murder. Specifically, we are calling, we are demanding that Officer Amber Guyger be fired, terminated, immediately,"" said family attorney Lee Merritt. ""She should not still be on the payroll ... There's no place for her ... This is non-negotiable.""

Kaufman County Jail

The news conference Friday came after it was revealed in a search warrant that a small amount of marijuana had been found in Jean's apartment.

The search warrant revealed that in addition to 10.4 grams of marijuana in Ziplock bags, two fired cartridge casings; a black backpack ""with police equipment and paperwork""; and a black ballistic vest with ""police"" markings had also been found in Jean's apartment.

Jeff Montgomery/Harding University/AP

An insulated lunchbox, laptop computer, metal marijuana grinder, two radio-frequency identification keys and two used packages of medical aid were also found in the apartment. It was not clear whether any of the items belonged to Jean.

Attorneys for the family called it an attempt to smear and ruin Jean's reputation.

""The taint on the investigation from the beginning was exposed through that warrant and through that content. It did nothing else,"" Merritt said.

Merritt also called for an internal police investigation on alleged leaks in the case.

In response to the shooting and subsequent events, dozen of protesters marched Friday night from the Dallas Police Department on South Lamar Street north, toward the Dallas Morning News, FOX 4, and WFAA buildings downtown, according to ABC News affiliate WFAA. They held American flags and shouted “Botham Jean” as they walked.

As some walked, a small group of protestors in cars stopped in the westbound lanes of Insterstate 30, blocking traffic with their cars. No arrests have been reported, according to the Associated Press.

ABC News

Jean was killed Sept. 6 at the South Side Flats apartment complex when Guyger mistook his apartment for her own and shot him. She fired when she opened the ajar door of the unit and saw a ""large silhouette,"" which she thought was that of a burglar, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.

On Thursday, the Kaufman County Sheriff's Office released video of Guyger behind bars in handcuffs and jail attire. Guyger, who does not speak during the video, was later released after posting $300,000 bond.

Dallas Police Chief Renee Hall last week turned over the investigation to the Texas Rangers.

WFAA

Hall is within her rights immediately terminate Guyger, but sources told ABC News that it would be rare to do so before the internal police report is complete.

Hundreds of friends and family filled a Texas church Thursday to celebrate Jean's life and condemn the actions that ""snatched"" him in his prime.

A spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety told ABC News affiliate WFAA-TV Thursday that the case was now with the Dallas County district attorney.

The single engine Columbia Aircraft LC41 crashed Saturday at around 11 a.m. in a residential neighborhood in Woburn.

Officials identified the victims as 65-year-old Dr. Michael Graver and 52-year-old Jodi Cohen.

Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan describes Graver was a ""very experienced pilot"" who co-owned the 2016 plane.

She says the couple departed from Republic Airport in Farmingdale, New York, at around 9:30 a.m. and had been heading to Laurence G. Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts.

The airport is about four miles from the crash site.

Woburn Mayor Scott Galvin says the plane fortunately did not hit any homes or injure anyone on the ground.

The National Transportation Safety Board and other agencies are investigating.","national transportation safety board

Martin Griffiths' visit to the capital on Sunday came after his push last week for peace talks between representatives from Yemen's internationally recognised government and the rebels fell apart before they could officially begin.

That meeting, which would have been the first in nearly two years, was scheduled to take place in the Swiss city of Geneva on September 6. The Houthi delegation however did not show up, accusing the UN of failing to guarantee their safe return to Sanaa and secure the evacuation of wounded rebels to Oman.

Shortly after the talks' collapse, the Saudi-UAE-backed government forces intensified their push to capture Houthi-held Hodeidah and its port, which is considered the lifeline of Yemen.

The offensive was first launched in June but was briefly halted in the lead-up to the Geneva initiative.

On Sunday, medical and hospital sources told AFP news agency that at 32 Houthi fighters had been killed in fierce fighting and air attacks around Hodeidah.

The Houthis also said that a Saudi-UAE air raid struck a radio station in the city's al-Marawa district, killing three security guards and one member of staff.

Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from nearby Djibouti, said the Saudi-UAE coalition's offensive on the city appeared to be ""at its most intense"" point.

""There are also many concerns rising for the level of malnutrition across the country, which is getting to a critical level,"" he added.

The UN has warned that continued conflict in Hodeidah, the entry point for the bulk of Yemen's commercial imports and aid supplies, could trigger a famine.

An estimated 8.4 million people are at risk of starvation in Yemen, according to the UN.

The country's three-year war has ensnared millions in the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 22 million in dire need of assistance. The UN says at least 10,000 people have been killed in the war, but the death toll that has not been updated in years and is certain to be far higher.

With logistical support from the United States, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have carried out attacks in Yemen since March 2015, in an attempt to reinstate the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

In 2014, Hadi and his forces were overrun by the Houthi rebels who took over much of the country, including Sanaa. Since then, they have recaptured some of the territory previously lost.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE see Hodeidah port as the main entry point of weapons for the Houthis and have accused their regional rival Iran of sending missiles to the rebels, a charge Tehran has denied.

Houthis 'sign memorandum' with UN

On Thursday, the UN's humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande warned that ""hundreds of thousands of lives hang in the balance"" in Hodeidah, with ""families absolutely terrified by the bombardment, shelling and air strikes"".

""The human cost and the humanitarian impact of this conflict is unjustifiable,"" Grande said.

Her comments came two days before Houthi officials said they had signed a memorandum of understanding with Grande to airlift critically ill patients abroad for treatment.

The Houthi-run Saba news agency reported on Saturday that the memorandum would include transporting critically ill Yemenis abroad from Tuesday 18 September, for a period of six months.

A report last month by a team of UN-mandated investigators concluded there were ""reasonable grounds"" to believe all parties in Yemen's war had ""committed a substantial number of violations of international humanitarian law"".","the

On an exceptionally rare occasion in the reclusive country, the first moment of the two leaders' encounter in North Korea's capital, as well as the summit's key events, will be beamed live to the rest of the world.

Moon's three-day trip, which starts on Tuesday and is only the third of its kind for a sitting South Korean president since the division of the Korean Peninsula, comes amid a diplomatic quandary over stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations between North Korea and the United States.

Washington wants to see a concrete timetable and actions for North Korea's denuclearisation before beginning to dole out any rewards to the country, which has a track record of defaulting on previous nuclear deals.

North Korea, on the other hand, has called for the US to provide a security guarantee through a joint declaration of a formal end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty, and left some international sanctions imposed on impoverished North Korea.

Irreconcilable gulf?

In late August, US President Donald Trump cancelled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's planned visit to Pyongyang at the 11th hour, citing a lack of sufficient progress made since his historic summit with Kim in Singapore in June.

The impasse presents an enormous challenge to pro-engagement Moon, who has been asked by both sides to play the role of mediator.

""If it becomes clear that the talks with North Korea are stuck, the hardliners in Washington and Seoul, especially in Washington, will have an upper hand and probably will start to demand a speedy return to their hardline maximum pressure policy,"" Andrei Lankov, professor at Kookmin University in Seoul, told Al Jazeera.

{articleGUID}

Lankov, who is among the many long-time North Korea watchers who are sceptical about the authenticity of the pledged nuclear disarmament, argued that South Korea's delegation would work hard to put on a theatrical performance that would create a sense that everything was fine.

""It is smart diplomacy, because it creates an environment where hardliners would have problems in pushing through their bellicose policy,"" he said.

Denuclearisation and sanctions

Denuclearisation is generally understood to be a time-consuming process, involving many stages before the dismantling of nuclear weapons.

""If you do this step by step, it becomes virtually impossible to achieve the denuclearisation within two-and-a-half years,"" Moon Chung-in, special adviser to the South Korean president, told foreign media in his personal capacity, referring to Kim's recent offer of Trump's first term as a target timeframe.

{articleGUID}

The adviser argued the upcoming summit could serve as an opportunity for South Korea's leader to persuade his counterpart on a simultaneous exchange approach, which he would later propose to Trump, too.

He floated one possible scenario that would see North Korea agreeing to an extraordinary concession such as allowing the US to take out some - if not all - nuclear weapons, and in return the US would be willing to ease some economic sanctions.

Agenda points

At the upcoming summit, another important matter on South Korea's agenda would be improving its own relations with North Korea.

In the economic field, there are relatively innocuous projects - such as cooperation in the forestry sector -that would not violate a string of sanctions from the United Nations Security Council, Bong Young-shik, a research fellow at Yonsei University Institute for North Korean studies, told Al Jazeera.

The two leaders are also expected to discuss ways to ease tensions along one of the world's most fortified borders, a follow-up on the Panmunjom Declaration after their inter-Korean summit on April 27.

{articleGUID}

The militaries from both sides have been holding meetings to discuss removing army guard posts and landmines inside the Demilitarised Zone and setting up a ""maritime peace zone"" in the West Sea, a scene of numerous deadly military skirmishes in the past.

""It would be tangible achievements of this summit if the two leaders agree on measures for conventional arms reduction,"" Bong added.

Experts have long acknowledged that it would be quite inconceivable for either country to use nuclear arms as its first choice of weaponry in modern-day warfare due to catastrophic consequences, yet warn of the possibility of an accidental clash rapidly escalating into an uncontrollable situation.","yonsei university institute for north korean studies

The 33-year-old Olympic champion ran a time of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds to complete the 42.2-kilometre (26.2 miles) race, successfully defending his title at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday.

He broke the previous world record, which was also set in Berlin by fellow Kenyan runner Dennis Kimetto in 2014 by 1 minute and 18 seconds.

""I lack the words to describe this day,"" said a beaming Kipchoge, a former world champion over 5,000 metres. ""I am really grateful and happy to smash the world record.""

Kipchoge, who is widely seen as the greatest marathon runner of the modern era, has lost only once over the distance. He won the London Marathon for the third time earlier in April.

{articleGUID}

His victories also include the 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro and the 2014 Chicago Marathon.

After going through the half-way mark in just over 61 minutes along the flat inner-city course on Sunday, Kipchoge upped the pace for a ferocious finish ahead of his countrymen Amos Kipruto and Wilson Kipsang, who finished second and third respectively.

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta congratulated the Olympic champion on his landmark feat on Twitter.

""Congratulations @EliudKipchoge for breaking the world record at the #BerlinMarathon2018,"" he wrote. ""I also congratulate his compatriots Amos Kipruto & Wilson Kipsang for going out valiantly to bring a 1-2-3 victory for #TeamKenya. You are our heroes. Kenya is proud of you.""

Thus, despite a number of significant and deadly flare-ups, the summer passed without a new large-scale … [+6823 chars]",Hamas and other Palestinian factions in Gaza have launched rockets at Israel in what they call a response to aggression.,2018-09-16T09:39:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Can Hamas walk the fine line between deterrence and escalation?,http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/hamas-walk-fine-line-deterrence-escalation-180915053438464.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/9/15/33dd8214e15f404abade63636cc02a53_18.jpg,general,2018-09-16 14:23:31.214622,"More than a month has passed since the last significant exchange of fire between the Israeli military and Palestinian factions in the occupied Gaza Strip.

Thus, despite a number of significant and deadly flare-ups, the summer passed without a new large-scale Israeli assault on the blockaded territory materialising.

While Israeli military strategy has long relied on deterrence - the idea that short, sharp shocks to enemy forces and civilian population will secure periods of ""quiet"" - events this summer beg the question whether Hamas and other factions in Gaza have established their own deterrence.

""Hamas is trying to avoid escalation as much as possible, and to give a chance to the rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip"", Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' international relations bureau, told Al Jazeera.

""But at the same time, Hamas has been trying, on different occasions, to send the message that we have the right to defend ourselves, the right to resist the occupation, and the moral duty not to accept dying in silence"".

On 29 May, al-Qassam Brigades and Islamic Jihad's al-Quds Brigades claimed joint responsibility for mortar fire that they said was a response to Israeli aggression over the previous 48 hours - including the killing of members of both groups.

""We will not let the enemy impose a new equation involving killing our people for free. The equation we will keep says: shelling for shelling and blood for blood"", the groups stated.

Again, on 20 June, Israeli attacks were the trigger for a retaliatory burst of rocket fire by Hamas, which itself prompted further Israeli air strikes.

A Hamas statement at the time declared a ""new approach of a bomb for a bomb"", and rejected Israel's attempts to ""impose any new equations"".

Similar dynamics played out in other rounds, including on 14 July, when Hamas retaliated to punitive Israeli air attacks with rocket fire, and on 7 August, when the last - and most serious - escalation began with Israel killing two al-Qassam members in what was later said to have been an ""error"".

According to Gaza-based Hamas spokesperson Hazim Qasim, while ""the Palestinian factions agreed that the Great Return March, which started on March 30, should be popular and peaceful"", Israel ""harshly targeted the peaceful protesters"" and additionally struck ""resistance sites and the fighters"".

He told Al Jazeera: ""Hamas' position was that the protests were peaceful and must remain peaceful, so Hamas decided not to let the occupation turn the protests [not] peaceful. Therefore, it decided that any military attack must have a military response"".

""Despite the huge power gap between Hamas and Israel"", Qasim added, ""Hamas, along with the other factions, were able to establish this deterrence equation"".

But did the summer mark a significant shift in tactics by Hamas?

For Tareq Baconi, Palestinian scholar and author of Hamas Contained: The Rise and Pacification of Palestinian Resistance', these events, in fact, reflected a longer-standing policy of deterrence adopted by Hamas and other factions, who ""for the most part, have responded to Israeli assaults with rocket fire"".

""If there was a shift in Hamas' resistance strategy"", Baconi told Al Jazeera, ""it was most palpable over the course of the Great March of Return - it was during this period that Hamas held back; there was not a single rocket fired over the official six weeks of protests, up to Nakba Day.""

Naim described the Great March of Return - which was not initiated by Hamas, but attracted its support - as ""a message for the Israelis and international community that, despite having the capability to respond to Israeli aggression, we preferred to exhaust all peaceful ways to raise our voice against the Israeli siege"".

With respect to the rounds of escalation post-Nakba Day, meanwhile, Naim told Al Jazeera that ""it is clear they were only a message, with the rockets being fired into the area immediately around the Gaza Strip"", as opposed to larger Israeli cities further away.

""Hamas has the ability to harm Israel, but showed great restraint, based on political responsibility towards our people,"" Naim added.

'No one rushing into war'

Israeli security officials and analysts acknowledged that Hamas acted with ""caution"" during the summer's rounds.

According to Haaretz defence correspondent Amos Harel, Netanyahu is keen to ""conclude indirectly an arrangement with Hamas"" and achieve a ""stable"" ceasefire"".

""No one is yet rushing into war,"" Harel stated.

The picture is more complex than one of simple military deterrence, however.

While Israel, ""and Netanyahu's government specifically, is quite sensitive to losses incurred because of Hamas"", said Baconi, Israel also ""benefits tremendously from having Hamas in power in Gaza, for a host of reasons, including demographics, divide-and-rule, stabilisation of the coastal enclave as an autonomous region and the containment of the ideology of resistance"".

Thus, ""Israeli officials have had to walk a fine line between deterrence and defeating Hamas"".

Hamas, too, has considerations beyond basic deterrence.

According to Adnan Abu Amer, political analyst and dean of the faculty of Arts and Humanities at Gaza's Ummah University, some in al-Qassam Brigades worry that the continuation of the siege and the failure of efforts to secure a long-term truce might lead to anti-Hamas demonstrations in Gaza - a risk that could compel the Brigades ""to direct public anger towards Israel"".

Further complicating matters is the ongoing bad blood between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Fatah on the one hand, and Hamas on the other.

Recent reports suggest that efforts to secure a long-term truce between Hamas and Israel, and a lifting of the Gaza blockade, have come unstuck over how to resolve the bitter national division that continues to play out on a routine basis through accusations and arrests.

""I think the resistance movements here in Gaza are trying to find a balance between creating a deterrence and finding an outcome or exit for the catastrophic situation"", said Hamas' Naim.

""The main idea now is that we have the capability to defend ourselves, but at the same time, we see that our moral and political responsibility is to give a chance to any political efforts by the United Nations, Egyptians, the Europeans, anyone - to improve the dire situation on the ground"".

Baconi, while recognising Hamas's desire to achieve a long-term ceasefire and loosened blockade, is pessimistic about a political breakthrough any time soon.

""I think until something fundamentally shifts on the ground, post-Abbas, the current situation is likely to persist, with the predictable escalations,"" he told Al Jazeera.

Such escalations carry inherent risks. ""Hamas has been seeking to use the recent military escalations to pressure Israel, Egypt and the UN to respond to its demands for calm, and in particular, breaking the siege"", said Abu Amer. ""But at the same time, Hamas does not want an open confrontation"".

""However, no one can guarantee that these rounds will remain only limited escalations, and the road is fraught with danger"".","united nations egyptians

It is opposite of La Nina, which is a cooling

El Nino is the name given to a slight warming of the surface waters of the Pacific

Except for a few cows in the fields, the small-scale farms in Mpudzi Resettlement area, eastern Zimbabwe, are deserted on this hot September afternoon.

From June to early October, farmers wait for the new cropping season, which normally starts in November - when temperatures rise.

Most still depend entirely on rain-fed agriculture and they closely monitor weather forecasts.

But the 2018/2019 rainy season does not look good.

The government has warned farmers of a possible El Nino-induced drought during the crop-growing season.

Elijah Ngwarati, a small-scale farmer, looks concerned as he considers the prospects of yet another severe drought in less than three years.

{articleGUID}

""We have been told that we might experience a severe drought this season and we are worried,"" Ngwarati, a 42-year-old father of three, told Al Jazeera. ""Imagine, it's hardly three years since another severe drought affected us.""

In an update on September 10, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said there was a 70 percent chance of an El Nino developing by end of this year.

""Climate change is influencing the traditional dynamics of El Nino and La Nina events as well as their impacts. 2018 started out with a weak La Nina event but its cooling effect was not enough to reduce the overall warming trend which means that this year is on track to be one of the warmest on record,"" WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas said in a statement.

Food shortage concerns

Washington Zhakata, who heads Zimbabwe's Climate Change Management Department, told Al Jazeera that once an El Nino sets in, depending on its strength and nature, the chances of low or below normal rainfall are between 50 and 65 percent.

""Usage of irrigation is critical, especially at the beginning of the season and during extended seasonal dry spells, among other strategies to mitigate the impacts of the El Nino,"" he said.

The 2015/2016 El Nino drought wiped out crops and left more than four million people without food, killing over 19,000 cattle nationwide.

During the 2016 drought, said Ngwarati, farmers had to travel long distances in search of food.

Maize, a staple in Zimbabwe, was scarce.

""It was disheartening. We watched as our crops wilted right before our eyes. And most of the crops were affected when they were already flowering.

""There was no water for our livestock and the only dam around here dried up. Both people and livestock had to crowd for a drink every day at the few boreholes which had water in the area.""

This time around, he said, the farmers have a plan.

""We have been advised to start planting with the early rains and the government has given us maize seed … But it's scary that we don't even know how much rainfall we are going to receive this coming season. The season doesn't look good.""

'We are cursed'

Henry Fusirai Nzarayebani, another farmer in the area, appeared solemn.

""I don't know what to do,"" he repeated. ""I'm not prepared for another drought especially when we have not yet recovered from the previous drought"".

Nzarayebani said the 2015/2016 drought was devastating, leaving many families without food or clean drinking water.

""We had to go for days without eating anything,"" he said.

However, he hoped that his small vegetable garden sustained by water from a nearby wetland could produce enough food for the lean months.

""I hope the wetland will not dry up in the event of a drought,"" he says.

Peter Makwanya, a climate change researcher and lecturer at the Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU), said small-scale farmers with access to underground water reserves should venture into horticulture, which brings immediate results.

""Horticulture can be done throughout the year,"" he told Al Jazeera, adding that training was necessary. ""After three months, farmers can realise their harvests.

""Most of these farmers still rely on traditional farming methods so issues of smart farming are not at the heart of their community of practice.""

As for government support, Agriculture Minister Perrance Shiri told the state-owned Herald newspaper that officials would speed up the installation of irrigation infrastructure as he encouraged farmers to broaden the range of their crops to include small grains.

But Shiri's assurance means little to panicked farmers.

""We are absolutely cursed,"" said Ngwarati.","world meteorological organization wmo

Two more people were killed as the storm made landfall in southern China, according to Chinese state broadcaster CGTN.

More than 2.4 million people had been evacuated from seven cities in Guangdong province of China, according to The Associated Press news agency.

In Hong Kong, authorities warned people to stay away from the Victoria Harbour landmark, where storm surges battered the waterfront reinforced with sandbags.

The gambling enclave of Macau, meanwhile, closed its casinos for the first time, according to the South China Morning Post, as nearly 50,000 fishing boats were called back to port.

Mangkhut made landfall in Guangdong around 5pm local time (09:00 GMT) on Sunday, packing wind speeds of 162 km/h, while 10-metre-high waves battered the coastline.

The national meteorological centre said southern China ""will face a severe test caused by wind and rain"" and urged officials to prepare for possible disasters.

The Hong Kong Observatory said although Mangkhut had weakened slightly, its extensive, intense rainbands were bringing heavy downfall and frequent squalls.

Hundreds of flights were cancelled. All high-speed and some normal rail services in Guangdong and Hainan provinces were also halted on Sunday, the China Railway Guangzhou Group Co said.

Footage posted on social media showed fierce winds throwing people to the ground, swaying buildings, smashed windows and serious flooding.

A video reportedly filmed in Hong Kong's Kowloon area showed scaffolding collapsing at a building site.

In Fujian province and elsewhere, tens of thousands of fishing boats returned to port and construction work came to a stop.

Fuelled by the warm waters of the South China Sea, the typhoon will begin to lose power now it is overland and will be reclassified as a tropical storm.

However, flooding over its forecast path is expected to be extensive as heavy rain falls out of the declining cyclone.

In Gyangdon, 250mm of rainfall is expected over the next 24 hours, with some pockets of 400mm.

Philippines hit hard

In the Philippines, the death toll of Mangkhut jumped to 64 on Sunday as more landslide victims were discovered.

Most were killed in landslides in or near the Cordillera mountain region, AP reported.

At least 40 people, mostly gold miners, got trapped in a landslide in the country's north.

Police superintendent Pelita Tacio told AP that a part of a mountain slope collapsed on the miners' homes in a far-flung village of Itogon town in Benguet province as winds and rain pounded the gold-mining region on Saturday.

Rescue efforts are being hampered by rain and mud but search operations are expected to resume at daybreak on Monday, according to Victorio Palangdan, the mayor of Itogon.

Al Jazeera's Jamela Alindogan, reporting from Cagayan province, said the storm cut off power and communications in the city of Tuguegarao and devastated rural communities in the region.

""We saw homes and farmland destroyed throughout rural communities. Access into these areas is difficult, which means aid may be slow to arrive, too,"" she said. ""They barely had anything before the typhoon, and now they have even less.""

Among the fatalities were an infant and a two-year-old child who died with their parents after the couple refused to immediately evacuate from their high-risk community in a Nueva Vizcaya mountain town, said Francis Tolentino, an adviser to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.

""They can't decide for themselves where to go,"" he said of the children, expressing frustration that the tragedy was not prevented.

We ventured out and drove past rural communities. One of the many areas that we saw... the devastation in the town of Bagao. No reported casualties so far, but quite a number of civilians lost their homes. @AJEnglish @tedregencia @AJENews #Mangkhut pic.twitter.com/vyjuJNPIJK — Jamela Alindogan (@jamelaaisha) September 15, 2018

About 87,000 people had evacuated from high-risk areas of the Philippines. Tolentino and other officials advised them not to return home until the danger had passed.

In Cagayan's capital, Tuguegarao, where the typhoon hit land, Associated Press journalists saw a severely damaged public market, its roof ripped apart and wooden stalls and tarpaulin canopies in disarray.

Outside a popular shopping mall, debris was scattered everywhere and government workers cleared roads of fallen trees.

The Tuguegarao airport terminal was also damaged, its roof and glass windows shattered by strong winds.

The typhoon struck at the start of the rice and corn harvesting season in the northern breadbasket, prompting farmers to scramble to save what they could of their crops, Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba said.","ajenglish tedregencia ajenews mangkhut pictwittercomvyjujnpijk

""They traded in something far more valuable to the English monarchy - slaves."" T… [+6712 chars]",Art historian Alice Procter's 'Uncomfortable Art Tours' come amid renewed debate over Europe returning African art.,2018-09-16T07:17:00Z,al-jazeera-english,"Alternative museum tours explore colonial loot, biased narratives",http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/alternative-museum-tours-explore-colonial-loot-biased-narratives-180915213140176.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/9/15/769b930910b74dcea82ba1387c095386_18.jpg,general,2018-09-16 14:23:31.214622,"London, England - ""The South Sea Company did not trade in fish,"" says Alice Procter, as she shows visitors around Queen's House, a maritime museum in Greenwich, southeast London. ""They traded in something far more valuable to the English monarchy - slaves.""

The 23-year-old Australian art historian is behind the ""Uncomfortable Art Tours"", a series of museum visits in the capital exploring history with a twist.

She focuses on what she describes as racist narratives and an ideology that underpins the objects displayed in European exhibitions from the colonial period, which isn't always mentioned.

On the Queen's House tour, portraits, botanical records, curios and engravings commemorating various European expeditions are analysed and put into context, sometimes to the discomfort of some of her tour group, who are mainly young white women - like Procter herself.

""It is no longer possible for Britain to present itself as a world power, and people aren't willing to pretend any more,"" says Procter. ""They are interested in the stories that aren't being told.""

Admiral Nelson's lifelong opposition to the abolition movement, the English Crown's financial involvement with slavery and the lack of evidence to support lurid tales of cannibalism all come as a bit of a shock.

""Museums provide almost a Trojan horse type of space to confront the official narratives we're told,"" says Procter, who started the tours in 2013.

""I started them out of a sense of frustration over the lack of self-awareness that white British people have over their pasts and history - and that lack of attention is part of the shadow of white supremacy and racism that's hanging over our heads right now.""

Museums provide a biased view of the past, she claims.

""While museums continue to argue that they are neutral spaces, the fact is that they are not. There is always one side of the story that has been privileged over the other in these spaces, and we need to be more honest and open about that.""

This challenge to the official narrative comes at a time when Europe is facing a renewed debate over returning African art, much of which was acquired as colonial-era loot.

Museums and galleries across Europe have faced repatriation claims for decades. The counter-argument has always been that these objects are now presented as part of a global history.

Our Britishness is based on an erasure of history, and the 'Great Britain' narrative is based on ignoring the bad in the past. It's important to look back to understand what's happening now. Kemi, Uncomfortable Art Tours visitor

Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Europe had a responsibility to return artefacts.

""African heritage can't just be in European private collections and museums,"" he said during a speech in Burkina Faso, later appointing two experts, one of whom is Senegalese, to oversee the repatriation process.

Other European nations followed suit.

In May this year, Germany's culture minister and the association of German museums released a ""code of conduct"" which included guidelines on how to research artefacts in collections, and how to repatriate colonial-era objects.

In the United Kingdom, the director of London's Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) made headlines when he suggested that the museum's Maqdala collection, around 80 artefacts looted from the palace of the Abyssinian Emperor Tewodros II in 1868 by British and colonial troops, could be returned to Ethiopia on a ""long-term loan"" basis. The country had filed a claim for their return in 2007.

""We believe that long-term loans are the quickest way to get these objects in front of the communities they came from,"" says Tristram Hunt, V&A director. ""The point about the Maqdala exhibition was to highlight the contentious provenance of the objects - and we decided to speak to the embassy about loaning these objects back because we need to be open and transparent about the collections.""

Formed in 2016, the Benin Dialogue Group, a consortium of European museums, discuss how best to return the Benin Bronzes, antiquities looted in 1897 during a punitive British military expedition to crush the dissenting West African Kingdom of Benin, in present-day Nigeria.

""There is great value in presenting objects from the Kingdom of Benin in a global context, alongside the stories of other cultures,"" a spokesperson for the British Museum, which is part of the group, told Al Jazeera.

""[The museum] will always consider loan requests subject to usual conditions.""

The British Museum currently possesses 700 artefacts from Benin which were plundered in 1897 and has faced restitution claims from both the Nigerian government and the Benin Royal Court.

Are long-term loans the solution?

Long-term loans have been greeted with reservation, due to the legal precedent they may set.

In order for a loan to go through, the country requesting the objects would first have to recognise the institute possessing the artefacts as being their legal owner - a contentious prospect when it comes to looted art.

This has fuelled concern over a potential whitewashing of the painful history behind how these artefacts were acquired by European nations during the ""Scramble for Africa"" in the 19th century.

Writing in the Modern Ghana journal, former UN legal adviser Kwame Opoku said long-term loans represented Europe's perceived ""God-given right and obligation to supervise Africans and their activities, including what obviously is African property and resource"".

Some activists, however, have conceded that the loans might be the best way for the artefacts to be returned for now.

""Many of my Ethiopian friends and colleagues are uneasy about a clear endorsement of a long-term loan on the grounds that that would be recognising the legitimacy of the loot,"" says Alula Pankhurst, a social anthropologist and member of AFROMET - The Association for the Return of The Maqdala Ethiopian Treasures. ""However, there are some who recognise the need for a pragmatic approach, building trust between museums in the UK and Ethiopia. Personally, I am more inclined to the latter view.""

Professor John Picton, emeritus professor of African art at London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), said repatriation sets an uncomfortable precedent that no museum will easily agree to, whatever the moral considerations.

""The ownership of the Benin Bronzes clearly lies with the Kings of Benin - but that argument won't convince museums to return them,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""What will is long-term loans, the construction of museums in Benin and increased cooperation between European museums and Africa to understand their collections better.""

Back on the Queen's House tour, visitors are forced to reflect on Britain's colonial past.

""Our Britishness is based on an erasure of history, and the 'Great Britain' narrative is based on ignoring the bad in the past,"" says Kemi, a journalist attending the tour. ""It's important to look back to understand what's happening now.""","londons school of oriental and african studies soas

The village, which has been home to Palestinian Bedouins for more than 60 years, doesn't appear on official maps.

It's easy to drive by without noticing it.

But now Khan al-Ahmar has become very visible both locally and internationally - a symbol of what's happening in the occupied West Bank.

Khan al-Ahmar is in Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under full Israeli control.

In order to build anything, Palestinians living in the area need a permit rarely issued by Israeli authorities.

In 2009, the Palestinians built a school in Khan al-Ahmar with Italian help. It's the village's only ""permanent"" structure. But this is an overstatement - the school is a ramshackle structure, just like the rest of the village.

As soon as it was erected, right-wing Israelis filed a court case asking for it to be demolished. After years of legal fights, Israel's High Court ruled last week in favour of demolishing not just the school, but the entire village.

Now, this decades-old village, which was never recognised, will be demolished by Israel.

Currently, Khan al-Ahmar's residents are in limbo, not knowing when the bulldozers will come.

Sara Abu Dahuk, 40, is one of them. She sits in her house, made of corrugated iron sheets and rope. It doesn't look like it could survive a breeze, let alone desert conditions, but it has - until now.

She is uncertain of her future and it sticks in her mind all day long.

""We are just really tired. Life has changed for us,"" she says.

""We used to go with our sheep and tend to them, but now we don't even leave the village unless there's an emergency. I am concerned about my children. What is their future? My son does not sleep at night, for fear of the Israelis. Whenever I think about the day the Israelis will come, I don't know how I will cope, or what I should pack.""

Abu Dahuk has a small bag already packed with the family's documents and other paperwork. Like many others, she doesn't know what else to pack. It's difficult to do so when you don't want to leave your home.

'The waiting is the most difficult thing'

Not knowing when the bulldozers will come, while knowing that the legal battle has been lost, has had an effect on the mindset of this community.

Nisreen, Abu Dahuk's 15-year-old daughter, wanted to be a teacher but those plans are now on hold.

{articleGUID}

""We go to sleep in fear of the Israelis coming. I don't even know if there will be school in the morning. The waiting is the most difficult thing.""

Despite the uncertainty, the village tries to keep to its routine.

Life here begins with the first morning light, when a man sings the Islamic call to prayer. There is no microphone to carry his voice, just the wind.

A rooster crows and horses and donkeys get up onto their legs, shaking away the sleep from their bodies. But for how long the routine will continue is unknown.

The Israelis have planned for a Jewish settlement, according to a plan known as E1, which has been around since 1994.

E1 seeks to expand the (illegal under international law) Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim. Israeli settlers are encouraged by the government to move to the occupied West Bank.

The settlements have all the services they need - water, gas, internet, and in some cases private roads running through Palestinian land.

In contrast, residents of villages such as Khan al-Ahmar don't have access to even basic services, are refused building permits, are subject to harassment by settlers and are governed not by civilian rule but by Israeli military rule.

As they wait for the bulldozers, Khan al-Ahmar's residents know the machines will destroy their homes quickly. They say they will fight them when they come, and the determined looks on their faces suggest that they will.

But there's also a resignation that time has run out; that it's not a matter of if, but when.

The only fight Khan al-Ahmar's residents have left is not saving the ramshackle structures housing them, but a refusal to leave this village, the only home they have known for more than six decades.

These are some of the experiences refugees and migrants stranded in western Bosnia report as they describe encounters with Croatian police.

The abuse, they say, takes place during attempts to pass through Croatia, an EU member, with most headed for Germany.

Bosnia has emerged as a new route to Western Europe, since the EU tightened its borders. This year, more than 13,000 refugees and migrants have so far arrived in the country, compared with only 755 in 2017.

In Velika Kladusa, Bosnia's most western town beside the Croatian border, hundreds have been living in makeshift tents on a field next to a dog kennel for the past four months.

When night falls, ""the game"" begins, a term used by refugees and migrants for the challenging journey to the EU through Croatia and Slovenia that involves treks through forests and crossing rivers.

However, many are caught in Slovenia or Croatia and are forced to return to Bosnia by Croatian police, who heavily patrol its EU borders.

Then, they have to start the mission all over again.

Some told Al Jazeera that they have attempted to cross as many as 20 times.

The use of violence is clearly not acceptable. It is possible to control borders in a strict matter without violence. Peter Van der Auweraert, Western Balkans coordinator for the International Organization for Migration

All 17 refugees and migrants interviewed by Al Jazeera said that they have been beaten by Croatian police - some with police batons, others punched or kicked.

According to their testimonies, Croatian police have stolen valuables and money, cut passports, and destroyed mobile phones, hindering their communication and navigation towards the EU.

""Why are they treating us like this?"" many asked as they narrated their ordeals.





""They have no mercy,"" said 26-year-old Mohammad from Raqqa, Syria, who said he was beaten all over his body with batons on the two occasions he crossed into the EU. Police also took his money and phone, he said.

""They treat babies and women the same. An officer pressed his boot against a woman's head [as she was lying on the ground],"" Mohammad said. ""Dogs are treated better than us … why are they beating us like this? We don't want to stay in Croatia; we want to go to Europe.""

Mohammad Abdullah, a 22-year-old Algerian, told Al Jazeera that officers laughed at a group of migrants as they took turns beating them.

""One of them would tell the other, 'You don't know how to hit' and would switch his place and continue beating us. Then, another officer would say, 'No, you don't know how to hit' and would take his place.

""While [one of them] was beating me, he kissed me and started laughing. They would keep taking turns beating us like this, laughing,"" Abdullah said.





Croatia's Interior Ministry told Al Jazeera that it ""strongly dismisses"" allegations of police brutality.

In an emailed statement, it said those attempting to cross borders know they are acting outside of the law, and claimed that ""no complaint so far has proved to be founded.""

At a meeting in late August with Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised Croatia for its control over its borders.

""You are doing a great job on the borders, and I wish to commend you for that,"" Merkel said.

But according to a new report, the UNHCR received information about 1,500 refugees being denied access to asylum procedures, including over 100 children. More than 700 people reported violence and theft by Croatian police.

Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify all of the claims against police, because many of the refugees and migrants said their phones - which held evidence - were confiscated or smashed. However, the 17 people interviewed separately reported similar patterns of abuse.

Shams and Hassan, parents of three, have been trying to reach Germany to apply for asylum, but Croatian authorities have turned them back seven times over the past few months.

Four years ago, they left their home in Deir Az Zor, Syria, after it was bombed.

Shams, who worked as a lawyer in Syria, said Croatian policemen strip-searched her and her 13-year-old daughter Rahma on one occasion after they were arrested.

The male officers handled the women's bodies, while repeating: ""Where's the money?""

They pulled off Shams' headscarf, threw it on the ground and forced her to undress, and took Rahma into a separate room.

""My daughter was very afraid,"" Shams said. ""They told her to take off all her clothes. She was shy, she told them, 'No.'

""They beat her up and stripped her clothes by force, even her underwear.

""She kept telling them 'No! No! There isn't [any money]!' She was embarrassed and was asking them to close the window and door so no one would see her. [The officer] then started yelling at her and pulled at her hair. They beat her up.""

Rahma screamed for her mother but Shams said she couldn't do anything.

""They took 1,500 euros ($1,745) from me and they took my husband's golden ring. They also broke five of our mobiles and took all the SIM cards … They detained us for two days in prison and didn't give us any food in the beginning,"" Shams said, adding they cut her Syrian passport into pieces.

""They put my husband in solitary confinement. I didn't see him for two days; I didn't know where he was.""

A senior policeman told Shams that she and her children could apply for asylum, but Hassan would have to return to Bosnia.

When she refused, she said the police drove the family for three hours to a forest at night and told them to walk back to Bosnia.

They did not have a torch or mobile phone.

She said they walked through the forest for two days until they reached a small town in western Bosnia.

""No nation has the right to treat people this way,"" Shams said.

In another instance, they said they were arrested in a forest with a group of refugees and migrants. All 15 of them were forced into a van for two hours, where it was difficult to breathe.

""It was closed like a box, but [the officer] refused to turn on the air conditioning so we could breathe. My younger son Mohammad - he's eight years old - he has asthma and allergies, he was suffocating. When we knocked on the window to ask if he could turn on the air conditioning, [the officer] beat my husband with the baton,"" Shams said.

No Name Kitchen, a volunteer organisation that provides assistance to refugees and migrants on the Balkan route, has been documenting serious injuries on Instagram.

In one post, the group alleges that Croatian police twice crushed a refugee's orthopaedic leg.

Peter Van der Auweraert, the Western Balkans coordinator for the International Organization for Migration, says he has heard stories of police brutality, but called for an independent investigation to judge how alleged victims sustained injuries.

""Given the fact that there are so many of these stories, I think it's in everyone's interest to have an independent inquiry to see what is going on, on the other side of the border,"" Van der Auweraert said.

""The use of violence is clearly not acceptable. It's not acceptable under European human rights law, it's not acceptable under international human rights law and it is to my mind also, not necessary. It is possible to control borders in a strict matter without violence.""

Shams' family journey from Syria was traumatic from the get-go, and they have spent and lost several thousand euros.

While travelling in dinghies from Turkey to Greece, they saw dead bodies along the way.

""We call upon Merkel to help us and open the borders for us. At least for those of us stuck at the borders,"" she said. ""Why is the EU paying Croatia to prevent our entry into the EU, yet once we reach Germany, after spending a fortune with lives lost on the way, we'll be granted asylum?""

""We have nothing,"" said her husband Hassan. ""Our houses have been destroyed. We didn't have any problems until the war started. We had peace in our homes. Is there a single country that accepts refugees?""

""There are countries but there's no way to reach them,"" Shams replied. ""This is our misery.""","international organization for migration

The last time that Russia mounted a military exercise the size of this week's Vostok 2018 event, ""Russia"" was the Soviet Union, Leonid Brezhnev was General Secretary, and Ronald Reagan had just been elected president of the United States. That was 1981, at the height of the Cold War. Now, with a distinct chill in relations with the United States well underway, the Russian Federation has put over 300,000 troops in the field—alongside tens of thousands of tanks, helicopters, and weapons of every sort—for a huge war game in Russia's far eastern reaches. And the country has invited the Chinese People's Liberation Army to play along, as well as the Mongolian General Purpose Force.

Vostok 2018 wrapped up on September 14, but it started a whole new wrinkle in international affairs. Russia and China have agreed to continue to conduct joint military exercises, as the interests of Russia and China (once far apart) begin to align in response to US military power and a bellicose President Donald Trump. The photos provided by the Russian Ministry of Defense illustrate a military bromance. Presidents Putin and Xi had a breakfast of blinis together in Vladivostok.

To calm nervous Europeans, the Russian Foreign Ministry reassured everyone that they were not pretending to fight NATO. ""In the exercise, the Russian forces playing the role of an opponent never use NATO uniform or weapons or selected English-speaking personnel, contrary to NATO's frequent practice of using Russian speakers wearing Soviet or Russian uniforms and armed with Russian weapons and equipment to impersonate a likely enemy,"" Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister, Colonel General Alexander Fomin said. ""Aware of how sensitive this aspect is and being open-hearted as we are, we will stick to our customary mode of action further on.""

Russia test-fired two Iskander short-range ballistic missiles during the maneuvers, and, if you believe Pravda, tested invisible missiles.

But not everything at Vostok 2018 may have gone off completely without a hitch:

Vostok 2018 gave the world a chance to get a look at some of the weapons that have been getting some use in Syria and eastern Ukraine. And it showed that Russia no longer sees China as an adversary but as a potential military ally, something that is sure to get NATO's (and Washington's) attention.

Finding new ways to say ""You should really go see this, it's not just about science"" is often a struggle.

Science Fair is a rare entry in the category because its human elements are so obvious. Teamwork, competition, obstacles to be overcome, and the ultimate high-stakes denouement. Humanity's at the forefront so often that it's easy to forget that the film is about science. In fact, all of the basic human issues nearly obscure what the movie's really about: teenagers on the edge of adulthood struggling through a world that often doesn't know what to do with them, yet they find their people—the kindred spirits they can finally feel at home with.

The movie is funny, emotional, and touching, with a universal theme that just happens to have science as a background. And it's really, really good.

The science fairs of my youth often featured kids struggled to come up with displays that actually did something, like baking-soda-powered volcanoes. But the competition at the center of Science Fair—the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair—is closer to things I did as a graduate student. The experiments are far too complex and require far too much replication to ever make sense doing in front of an audience. Instead, the data's all analyzed and laid out on a poster, and the experimenter(s) talk people through the details.

If the kids are successful at regional competitions, they earn the right to go to the finals. That week-long competition is judged by scientists and draws competitors from dozens of countries. It's a bit like a science olympiad with the exception that, in addition to awarding winners and placers in various disciplines, a single research project is named the overall winner each year.

How do you get a high school kid doing graduate level science? There's no one path to that, and that's one of the things the film makes clear by following a variety of students in the lead up to one year's competition.

The filmmakers behind Science Fair have chosen their subjects brilliantly. There's the remarkably mature over-achiever, two years younger than her classmates, who's just learning her first inklings of humility (in part by losing in these competitions). There's a Brazilian team from a community that still has dirt roads and whose teachers cry as they think of the doors that success at the competition would open. And there's the articulate goofball whose parents watch in bemusement as he nearly flunks trigonometry because he's distracted by number theory, which he's been teaching himself.

Adults also play an active role.

We spend time with the PhD-holding daughter of African immigrants who serves as the hyper-demanding den mother to a large high school that regularly sends a half-dozen teams to the final. And a South Dakota high school football coach who ends up mentoring one of the students—not because he understands her research but simply because he's willing to push her when her school's science teachers lose interest. (That disinterest is nearly school-wide: her fellow students don't even know she exists, despite her success in past years.)

Nearly every one of these characters (and many others I've not mentioned) is fascinating and could probably be the subject of a short film on their own. But the film's real impact comes from the picture that these characters are used to paint.

It's probably an overstatement to say that Science Fair humanizes scientists. These kids are as obsessive and quirky as a top-level athlete. But despite their quirkiness, the students form teams, support each other, get excited about each others' projects, and go to parties and form crushes once they all get together in one place for the final competition. For so many of them, coming from schools that don't know what to do with their brains and drive, this is probably the first time they really feel like they're among their peers, and it briefly makes the Intel International Science Fair seem secondary.

Most importantly, though, Science Fair makes clear that its subjects are humane, working on things like simple testing for arsenic in water, a defense against Zika virus, or a better understanding of at-risk teens. And, in making that point, the movie drives home why science is so important and deserves to be valued more than it is by people other than the ones obsessed by it.","intel international science

I feel that you, my dear reader, have not suffered enough during that drought. So, quantum physics it is. Even better, we are going to talk about entanglement and the strange case of one-way EPR steering. One-way EPR steering is an idea that has moved from a purely theoretical suggestion to something that might actually work in practice.

Let’s do some physics

The concept of entanglement in quantum mechanics expresses the idea that seemingly separate quantum particles can have correlations that are larger than would be possible in a purely classical world. When combined with superposition, in which particles have an indeterminate mix of two properties, it becomes pretty mind blowing.

Since the research in question used photons, let’s use photons for our examples. Imagine that I have a device that produces pairs of photons that are entangled in their polarization state. (Polarization describes the orientation of the photon’s electric field.) The polarization could involve oscillating in parallel with the lab table, or it could be oscillating vertically. But, whatever polarization one photon has, the entangled one has the opposite. As soon as I measure one, I know the other. So far, so not special.

I don’t have to measure the polarization along those two directions though. I could measure at 45 degrees. At that angle, the photons are in a superposition state of being at +45 degrees and -45 degrees. If I were to measure 10 photons in identical superposition states, I would get, on average, half of each polarization.

But my photons are part of an entangled pair. When I make a measurement on one photon, it randomly chooses a polarization. As soon as it does so, the state of the second photon is locked into place. This is despite the fact that the two photons may be separated by light years and have no way of knowing about the measurement made on either photon. This seemingly nonsensical result was pointed out by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (hence EPR). Experiments have since borne out that reality is, in fact, nonsensical.

If that did not disturb you, try the following. Our two entangled photons are sent in different directions. One is captured by Alice, and the other by Bob. Alice can change the results of Bob’s measurements by making her measurements first. And, if she knows what sequence of measurements Bob is going to make, she can steer the results of those measurements through her own choice of measurements. Of course, Bob can do the same to Alice. This is EPR steering.

A version of this called one-way EPR steering means that Alice can manipulate Bob’s results but Bob cannot manipulate Alice’s. This is what the researchers have demonstrated.

One-way steering

Or sort of demonstrated, as part of a larger collection of results. What the researchers really did was close some of the loopholes that allowed a bit of uncertainty about whether steering was really happening in previous experiments. But the experiments also show that not all quantum states are steerable. The states have to be relatively pure. A photon in an entangled state could also be mixed with a photon that is not in an entangled state, for instance. But one-way steering does not tolerate that very well.

The researchers also showed that the relative detection efficiency matters. The state can be less pure if Bob is less efficient at detecting photons than Alice. Or, to be more specific, the experiment uses a technique called heralding. Every entangled photon is accompanied by a second photon that can be split off. Bob and Alice use the arrival of this second photon as a signal to make their measurements. If Bob has difficulty detecting the herald photon, he can’t easily steer Alice’s measurements, while Alice can still steer his measurements.

Is the case for steering completely closed? Well, maybe not. The researchers were dissatisfied with how to distinguish between steering and non-steering states. So they dove into the theory and derived a new way to distinguish the two cases. Their new limit is more general than the previous result. That is really useful because it gives everyone else something to use. In their own words, though, their expression represents a sufficient condition but not a necessary condition. It may be possible to come up with an even stricter limit that is both necessary and sufficient.

I’m sure that if we all thought really hard about this, we might think of possible applications. And, yes, EPR steering has implications for quantum key distribution. But really I don’t care. This is quantum physics at its best: exploring the implications of the theory and twisting commonsense into knots.

NEW YORK—You have to hand it to BMW. Our first look at its new Vision iNext concept car—a production version of which arrives in 2021—was certainly memorable. I've seen concepts unveiled at auto shows and at design studios, but this was definitely the first time I've seen one introduced in the belly of a Boeing 777F parked under a cover at Kennedy Airport in New York. Ars was invited to get up close and personal with the iNext, which is an important vehicle for BMW. When the production version goes on sale in 2021, it will be the first use the company's new vehicle architecture and its first long-range battery electric vehicle.

BMW says we can think of the iNext as ""Project i 2.0,"" Project i being the sub-brand that has given us the rather good i3 and the sublime i8. But let's be honest: both of those EVs served rather limited niches; a crossover is always going to have mass appeal. And so a crossover is what we have; one with bold styling and some thoughtful ideas for the future of UI, UX, and interior cabin design that BMW will hopefully iterate into production.

Further Reading BMW i: An electric, autonomous, vehicular “Skunk Works”? But let's be clear: the Vision iNext is still a concept car, and all it takes is a walk through BMW's museum to see that a lot of cute concept details end up on the cutting-room floor between the design studio and the showroom.

It looks dramatic

The front of the Vision is dominated by a massive ""butterfly""-covered kidney grill. EVs don't need big front air intakes, but these corporate styling cues are now proving an ideal place to conceal the sensors necessary for autonomous driving, and BMW is running with it. The headlights are an extremely stylized version of the marque's traditional four-eye look and are embedded into a strip of belt line that separates the hood from the wings.

The Vision is most handsome in profile, with a two-box outline that's reminiscent of the new Volvo XC40. The touch-sensitive suicide doors make access to the interior a charm; the fact we all still call them suicide doors may be a marketing challenge, but it's one BMW has already tackled with the i3. As the doors open—and in common with the previous i cars—you can see parts of the iNext's naked carbon-fiber passenger cell.

Some of the more dramatic elements of the exterior design seem likely to change before 2021, though. Cameras instead of wing mirrors are a good idea as it significantly cuts wind noise—most noticeable in a battery EV with near-silent propulsion—but require some regulation changes in the US and abroad. And the prominent rear diffuser—complete with electroluminescent blue highlights on the trailing edge—looks great in a mood-lit cargo hold, but it also looks like the first point of contact for a rear-ender.

The interior makes a statement

If you look at the interior and think ""boutique hotel,"" congratulations: that was the look BMW's interior-design team was going for. The two displays stand proud of the dash like expensive flatscreen TVs. The center console takes this idea even further; its surface is a mix of wood and a turquoise jacquard carpet that's also used to upholster the rear bench seat. On the underside, a crystal bowl plays storage cubby.

User interfaces are concealed underneath fabrics or surface treatments in what BMW calls ""shy tech."" Touch sensors just underneath the rear seat fabric detect your finger's input and leave light trails; BMW imagines using user-defined gesture controls like touches, swipes, and drawing shapes or glyphs to interact with the infotainment system, and instead of display screens for rear passengers, there's an intelligent beam projector that can display an interface onto physical objects. (BMW demonstrated this with a book.) As well as that touch-based interaction, the iNext features an onboard personal AI assistant, which BMW says should ideally be able anticipate most of what you want to do even before you ask it.

We first heard about a new BMW called the iNext in 2016. That's when the company announced it was partnering with Intel and Mobileye to work on such a vehicle, which would be autonomous and go on sale in 2021. That still appears to be the plan; if the hidden sensors weren't a clue, the retracting steering wheel and pedals should be. BMW told me that it is planning to launch the iNext with level 3 autonomy. Interestingly, this bucks the industry trend of skipping this kind of conditional self-driving because it runs the greatest risk of mode confusion. And even when level 4 systems become practical, the idea is still to sell them as options on customer cars, not run a fleet of robo-taxis.

As with the Volvo 360c we looked at earlier this week, it's hard to judge much of what I saw. The UX demos were definitely thought-provoking, but none seemed mature enough to be on sale within the next three years. Likewise, the self-driving stuff still has a way to go before it's ready for deployment. And we're still too far from production for BMW to comment on the stuff I do want to know about, like the batteries, motor output, and range.

BART is one of the largest mass transit agencies in northern California, with a system that stretches from the San Francisco International Airport, through San Francisco itself, across to Oakland, north to Antioch and south to Fremont—adjacent to Silicon Valley. This new policy puts it in line with a number of other regional cities that impose community oversight on the acquisition and use of surveillance technology. It is believed to be one of the first, if not the first, such policies for a transportation agency in the nation.

Santa Clara County, in addition to the cities of Oakland, Berkeley, Davis, and most recently, Palo Alto, have also passed similar measures.

The new BART policy was approved just one day after the Bay Area News Group reported that BART police had been using license plate readers at the parking garage at MacArthur station in Oakland for several months beginning in January 2017. The data collected was, in turn, shared with a ""fusion center"" of federal law enforcement data known as the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center.

Somehow, the MacArthur license plate reader (LPR) system was installed months after the Board had voted in 2016 to delay installation of the high-speed scanners until a policy for their use could be drafted.

Numerous Bay Area cities are concerned about the sharing of data collected by local law enforcement with federal immigration agencies. California, after all, is a ""sanctuary state,"" under a recent state law that took effect in January, which forbids local police from enforcing federal immigration law or aiding in deportations unless that person has been convicted of one of hundreds of approved crimes.

A tricky balance

Further Reading Silicon Valley county passes new law requiring approval before cops buy spy kit The agency has been under renewed pressure to expand surveillance in the wake of a July 2018 stabbing death of a woman named Nia Wilson, also at the MacArthur BART station.

By June 2017, every car on all the trains in the fleet were equipped with in-car video monitoring. That move only took place after the San Francisco Chronicle revealed in February 2016 that 77 percent of the in-car cameras were decoys or non-functional.

Local civil liberties groups applauded the new policy.

""Today's decision will help BART staff and law enforcement officials begin to earn back the community's trust by asking us for feedback about how they navigate the city,"" Sameena Usman, of the Council on American Islamic Relations in San Francisco, which lobbied for the policy, said in a Thursday statement.

""Further, the passage of this ordinance will empower community members to have a say in the spaces they occupy—which will increase public safety in and of itself.""

Meanwhile, Shahid Buttar, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that, while his group supports the policy overall, it’s not flawless.

""It includes a potentially dangerous exception for law enforcement to conduct a 'trial' period use of unapproved spy tech for up to 60 days at a single station,"" he wrote on Friday.

""We hope the limited duration for a trial suggests that it will not become a back door to permanence. The BART Board will need to actively ensure that potential trials remain truly temporary.""","macarthur license plate reader lpr

Jennifer Ouellette,Enlarge / Finding a distraction is key for young children trying to resist the marshmallow. reader comments 72 The psychologist who famously demonstrated the importance of being able to delay gratification to achieving later success in life died on September … [+3814 chars],Columbia University psychologist was best known for his work on delayed gratification.,2018-09-14T23:15:32+00:00,ars-technica,"R.I.P.

Walter Mischel, emeritus professor of psychology at Columbia University and self-proclaimed ""Marshmallow Man,"" was 88.

Per Columbia University's announcement:

""Professor Mischel is revered for his work in self-regulation. He is the author of the popular book The Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control. In it, he describes his groundbreaking studies of young children in the 1960s and 1970s, during which they were given the choice between receiving one immediate treat and receiving two treats 15 minutes later. The tactics used by the youngsters to distract themselves had implications for delayed gratification in adults. For example, when faced with the urge to smoke or a choice between arguing versus compromise, Mischel recommended keeping a goal in mind and focusing on the consequences of losing self-control.""

Mischel's landmark behavioral study involved 600 kids between the ages of four and six, all culled from Stanford University's Bing Nursery School. He would give each child a marshmallow and gave them the option of eating it immediately if they chose. But if they could wait 15 minutes, they would get a second marshmallow as a reward. Then Mischel would leave the room and a hidden video camera would tape what happened next.

Some kids just ate the marshmallow right away. Others found a handy distraction: covering their eyes, kicking the desk, or poking at the marshmallow with their fingers. Some smelled it, licked it, or took tiny nibbles around the edges, hoping the examiner wouldn't notice. Roughly one-third of the kids held out long enough to earn a second marshmallow. Several years later, Mischel noticed a strong correlation between the success of some of those kids later in life (better grades, higher self confidence) and their ability to delay gratification in nursery school. Mischel's follow-up study confirmed the correlation.

""The capacity to hold out for a second marshmallow is shaped in large part by a child's social and economic background.""

Earlier this year, a study published in the journal Psychological Science that replicated the marshmallow test with preschoolers concluded the picture is a bit more nuanced. It found the same correlation between later achievement and the ability to resist temptation in preschool, but it was much less significant after the researchers factored in such aspects as family background, home environment, and so forth. ""The capacity to hold out for a second marshmallow is shaped in large part by a child's social and economic background—and, in turn, that that background, not the ability to delay gratification, is what's behind kids' long-term success,"" co-author Jessica McCrory Calarco of Indiana University wrote in The Atlantic in July.

Mischel himself advised caution when interpreting his original findings. “The idea that your child is doomed if she chooses not to wait for her marshmallows is really a serious misinterpretation,” he told PBS in 2015.

Mischel was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1930; his family fled the Nazi occupation in 1938 and moved to the United States. He went on to earn his PhD in clinical psychology from Ohio State University, teaching at the University of Colorado, Harvard, and Stanford (where he conducted his famous Marshmallow Test) before moving to Columbia in 1983. He is among the most cited psychologists of the 20th century. Part of his interest in delayed gratification stemmed from his own three-pack-a-day smoking habit; he kept trying, and failing, to quit.

Mischel is survived by his wife, Michele Tolela Myers, three daughters, and several grandchildren. ""Walter was a living legend in psychology yet a humble mentor and colleague. We will miss him dearly."" said Carl Hart, chair of Columbia's Department of Psychology and the Ziff Professor of Psychology.","columbias department of psychology

Overclocking is typically a trial-and-error process: increase the clock speed, run some intensive workloads to make sure everything works OK, maybe fiddle with the GPU voltage to eke out a bit more stability. Push the clock speed too high, and the system stands a good chance of locking up and crashing. This means that finding the optimal settings can cause lots of rebooting and adjustment. Verifying that the GPU really is stable at a given speed is also a challenge, as not all workloads use all parts of the chip. A given clock speed might be fine for some kinds of software but not others.

Scanner will make this process a lot more automatic and trustworthy. It will run incrementally and increase the clock speed and voltage of the GPU to build a profile of a specific card's capabilities, testing the GPU's computing ability at each speed to make sure that it's operating properly. Generally there will be arithmetic errors, rather than outright crashes, when the GPU is being operated only very slightly faster than it can support. So by making only small adjustments, Scanner can probe the limits of what the chip can handle without the crashes and reboots, and without human intervention. The whole process takes about 20 minutes.

The overclocking performed by Scanner only applies to the GPU; for memory overclocking you'll need to stick with traditional methods. If you prefer to use those traditional methods for the GPU itself, that's still going to be possible, too.

Scanner isn't an application; rather it's an API. Scanner support will be integrated into the various overclocking apps built and shipped by GPU vendors. At launch, it will support only the new 20-series parts, but support for older chips is expected to ship later.

This is a smart approach to overclocking, so much so that it's a bit surprising that it's taken so long to arrive. Nvidia knows how best to induce hot-spots and thermal instability in its chips, so in principle at least, Scanner's determination that a given speed is stable should be a lot more accurate than the kind of ""3DMark runs OK so it's probably good"" testing that end-users normally use. Because it's automated, Scanner can make smaller incremental changes than a human would, without being overwhelmed by the tedium of the trial and error testing. One wonders if all overclocking software shouldn't work the same way.

We'll be giving Scanner a test ourselves to see if it really does make effective overclocking easier; you'll be able to find out how we got on in our review next Wednesday.

WannaCry leveraged an exploit called EternalBlue, software that leveraged Windows' Server Message Block (SMB) network file sharing protocol to move across networks, wreaking havoc as it spread quickly across affected networks.

The core exploit used by WannaCry has been leveraged by other malware authors, including the NotPetya attack that affected companies worldwide a month later, and Adylkuzz, a cryptocurrency-mining worm that began to spread even before WannaCry. Other cryptocurrency-mining worms followed, including WannaMine—a fileless, all-PowerShell based, Monero-mining malware attack that threat researchers have been tracking since at least last October. The servers behind the attack were widely published, and some of them went away.

But a year later, WannaMine is still spreading. Amit Serper, head of security research at Cybereason, has just published research into a recent attack on one of his company's clients—a Fortune 500 company that Serper told Ars was heavily hit by WannaMine. The malware affected ""dozens of domain controllers and about 2,000 endpoints,"" Serper said, after gaining access through an unpatched SMB server.

WannaMine is ""fileless,"" sort of. It uses PowerShell scripts pulled from remote servers to establish a foothold on computers and run all of its components. But WannaMine isn't purely fileless by any means—the PowerShell script that establishes its foothold downloads a huge file full of base64-encoded text. ""In fact, the downloaded payload is so large (thanks to all of the obfuscation) that it makes most of the text editors hang and it’s quite impossible to load the entire base64’d string into an interactive ipython session,"" Serper wrote in his post.

Inside that file is more PowerShell code, including a PowerShell version of the Mimikatz credential-stealing tool copied directly from a GitHub repository. There's also a huge binary blob—a Windows .NET compiler—which the malware uses to compile a dynamic-link library version of the PingCastle network scanning tool for locating potentially vulnerable targets elsewhere on the network. The harvested credentials and network data are then used to attempt to connect to other computers and install more copies of the malware. The DLL is given a random name, so it's different on every infected system.

WannaMine's PowerShell code does a number of things to make itself at home. It uses the Windows Management Instrumentation to detect whether it has landed on a 32-bit or 64-bit system to pick which version of its payload to download. It configures itself as a scheduled process to ensure it persists after a system shutdown, and it changes the power management settings of the infected computer to make sure the machine doesn't go to sleep and its mining activities go uninterrupted. This code shuts down any process using Internet Protocol ports associated with cryptocurrency-mining pools (3333, 5555, and 7777). And then it runs PowerShell-based miners of its own, connecting to mining pools on port 14444.

The thing that is perhaps the most aggravating about the continued spread of WannaMine is that the malware continues to use some of the same servers that were originally reported to be associated with it. Serper reached out to all of the hosting providers he could identify from the addresses and got no response. The command and control servers are:

118.184.48.95, hosted by Shanghai Anchnet Network Technology Stock Co., Ltd in Shanghai.

104.148.42.153 and 107.179.67.243, both hosted by the DDoS mitigation hosting company Global Frag Servers in Los Angeles (though the company also appears to be a Chinese network operator).

172.247.116.8 and 172.247.166.87, both hosted by CloudRadium L.L.C., a company with a disconnected phone number and a Los Angeles address shared with a number of other hosting and co-location service providers.

45.199.154.141, hosted in the US by CloudInnovation, which claims to be based in South Africa but gives a Seychelles address in its network registration.

Oakland Raiders wide receiver Martavis Bryant is eligible to play in games while he appeals his yearlong suspension.

Per ESPN.com's Adam Schefter, the NFL is allowing Bryant to play as he goes through the appeals process, and his case is expected to be heard ""in the next couple of weeks.""

The Raiders re-signed Bryant on Wednesday, giving the talented wideout a one-year deal after they released him on Sept. 1.

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo reported at the time Bryant was facing another suspension from the league.

Schefter noted Bryant's camp is ""confident"" he has a chance to win the appeal, which was one of the reasons the Raiders decided to bring back the 26-year-old.

Oakland acquired Bryant from the Pittsburgh Steelers in April for a third-round draft pick. The former Clemson star was suspended for a minimum of one year in 2016 for violating the NFL's substance-abuse policy.

Bryant appeared in eight games with the Steelers last season after the NFL conditionally reinstated him. He finished 2017 with 603 receiving yards and three touchdowns on 50 receptions in eight games.","daniel gluskoterassociated

Barcelona captain Lionel Messi has reportedly emerged as a future transfer target for David Beckham's Major League Soccer side Inter Miami.

The club want to make a signature signing ahead of their first season in MLS in 2020 and feel they could tempt the Argentine superstar away from the Camp Nou, according to Oliver Holt for the Mail on Sunday.

Inter Miami have not yet made contact with Messi, but there is hope a ""huge bid"" and a move to the United States may appeal to the player and his family, per the report.

Signing Messi would be a huge statement of intent, and ""executives at several MLS clubs"" are said to be convinced Inter will try to land the forward, according to Holt.

Messi signed a new contract with Barcelona in November which runs until the end of the 2020/21 season, when he will be 33. He has a release clause of €700 million, per the club's official website.

The Barcelona star joined the club when he was 13 and wants to finish his career with the Catalan giants, per BBC Sport. He said: ""I'm happy to continue with the club, which is my home. My dream was to finish my career at Barca and we are moving down that path.""

Messi has enjoyed great success at Barcelona and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players ever to have graced the game. He was won nine league titles, picked up six Copa del Rey trophies and claimed the UEFA Champions League four times.

He replaced Andres Iniesta as club captain ahead of the season after the midfielder's departure to Japanese side Vissel Kobe. Messi said it was a ""source of great pride"" to wear the armband, per the club's official website.

Francisco Seco/Associated Press

Messi seems highly unlikely to play for another European club, but he has mentioned the possibility of playing back in his native Argentina at the end of his career in an interview with Argentine television station El Trece (h/t Rik Sharma at The Independent).

""I’m increasingly sure that in Europe, Barcelona will be my only club,"" he said. ""I always said I wanted to play in Argentine football one day, I don’t know if it will happen but I have it in my mind. It would be at Newell’s, nowhere else. I would like to do that for at least six months, but you never know what will happen.""

It remains to be seen if Messi could be lured to MLS. He did send a congratulatory message to Beckham in January 2017 which may give the Englishman hope he can be persuaded to move.

According to Marca, he said: ""Hi David, first of all congratulations, I hope all goes well with the new project, in this new step you are taking and who knows, in a few years maybe you will give me a call.""

Messi is not the first player to be linked with Beckham's franchise. According to the Mirror's John Richardson, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney have also emerged as possible targets.","soccrates imagesgetty images barcelona

With Josh Gordon's imminent departure from the Cleveland Browns, teams in need of help at wide receiver have to decide if they want to take a chance on the troubled playmaker.

Per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Gordon has the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers atop his wish list.

Browns general manager John Dorsey announced Saturday that Gordon was going to be released:

""This afternoon we informed Josh Gordon and his representatives that we are going to release him on Monday. For the past six years, the Browns have fully supported and invested in Josh, both personally and professionally, and wanted the best for him, but unfortunately we've reached a point where we feel it's best to part ways and move forward. We wish Josh well.""

Per Cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot, Gordon was ""not himself"" after showing up late to the team's facilities Saturday.

""Team doctors examined him, and in addition to the tweaked hamstring, there was concern that perhaps he was struggling again with his sobriety or on the verge of relapsing, sources said,"" Cabot wrote.

Schefter noted teams were calling the Browns about potentially trading for Gordon after they announced he would be released. The 49ers and Cowboys would make sense.

The 2013 Pro Bowler is from Texas and played college football at Baylor, and Dallas needs help at receiver after releasing Dez Bryant in April. San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan, meanwhile, worked with Gordon during the 2014 season when he was Cleveland's offensive coordinator.

Gordon has 3,106 receiving yards and 16 touchdowns in 41 games since 2012. He missed the entire 2015 and 2016 seasons and only played 10 games total in 2014 and 2017.","david richardassociated

Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is officially active for Sunday's game against the Minnesota Vikings, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Schefter reported the Packers QB suffered what one source called a ""pretty unusual injury that would keep most people out awhile."" Schefter added the injury is described as a ""compression injury from blunt force while bent"" that could take up to a couple of months to completely heal.

""He shouldn't have played last week and shouldn't play now, but he likely will,"" one source told Schefter. ""There will certainly be a short leash, like there was last week, but we saw what happened.""

While Schefter indicated there was no ligament damage, Jay Glazer of Fox Sports reported Rodgers has a ligament sprain in addition to a bone bruise, per Mike Florio of NBC Sports. Rodgers is experiencing pain and swelling and will be monitored Sunday, according to Glazer.

Rodgers was seen wearing a knee brace before Sunday's game, per Tom Pelissero of NFL Network:

Rodgers, 34, suffered what he's called a sprained knee in Week 1's win over the Chicago Bears. He was injured in the first half but came back into the game, leading a 20-point comeback despite dealing with considerable pain.

Rodgers missed practice the entire week. However, head coach Mike McCarthy said Rodgers did not need to practice to play but acknowledged his status for Saturday's practice would be a factor. ""He feels better than he did at the beginning of the week,"" McCarthy said. ""Tomorrow's practice will be a big indicator.

""He can play with no reps. We've established that point some time ago in his career. You'd like to walk off the field Saturday and have your plan set, but this is the NFL. Things happen. We'll be ready for anything. I know he wants to play. We'll see how it goes.""

Rodgers missed nine games last season because of a broken collarbone, and the Packers went 3-6 in those games and have historically struggled in games he has missed.

DeShone Kizer would have gotten the start for the Packers. Yet he turned the ball over twice in three possessions against the Bears and had one of the worst rookie seasons for a quarterback in recent history in 2017 with the Cleveland Browns. The Notre Dame product threw for 2,894 yards and 11 touchdowns against 22 interceptions.

Rodgers will face a Vikings defense that recorded three sacks and hit Jimmy Garoppolo nine times last week.","adam schefter schefter

The tariff level will probably be about 10%, the Wall Street Journal reported, quoting people familiar with the matter. This is below the 25% the administration said it was considering for this possible round of tariffs.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The upcoming tariffs will be on a list of items that included $200 billion worth of internet technology products and other electronics, printed circuit boards, and consumer goods including Chinese seafood, furniture, and lighting products, tires, chemicals, plastics, bicycles, and car seats for babies. It was unclear if the administration will exempt any of the products that were on the list, which was announced in July.

On Friday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump ""has been clear that he and his administration will continue to take action to address China's unfair trade practices. We encourage China to address the long-standing concerns raised by the United States.""

Trump had already directed aides to proceed with tariffs, despite Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's attempts to restart trade talks with China.

One observer in the business sector said the administration may have reduced its planned tariff level after hearing public comments, hoping companies would not immediately hike prices for consumer goods to pass along the costs. Still, the additional tariffs could complicate trade talks with China expected later this month.

Trump has demanded that China cut its $375 billion trade surplus with the United States, end policies aimed at acquiring US technologies and intellectual property and roll back high-tech industrial subsidies.

This week, the world's two largest economies appeared to be making progress on trade. The Treasury invited senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Liu He, for more talks.

The administration has already levied duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods following a study on China's intellectual property practices released earlier this year.

On September 7, Trump warned that he had further tariffs ready to go on $267 billion worth of Chinese imports beyond those that will be targeted this week. If all of the tariffs were invoked, total imports from China facing tariffs would exceed the $505 billion in goods that the United States imported from China last year.

This year, imports from China through July were up nearly 9% from the same period of 2017, according to US Census Bureau data.

But when that figure is compared to actual US household income, things look decidedly less rosy. The latter has only recently climbed back to levels seen in 2007, before the financial crisis caused it to decline.

In other words, there's been a sharp divergence between the two measures over the past decade — one that will create an increasingly untenable situation as it gets more distorted.

It's a dynamic that played out before the last two market crashes. And experts at AJ Bell warn that we're currently dealing with similarly excessive conditions.

""Household net worth cannot sustainably grow this much faster than incomes,"" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, wrote in a note to clients. ""Assets have been bid up (and up) and at some stage there has to be chance that they correct, just as happened in 2000 and 2007.""

The chart below shows US household net worth over history. Note how its two most glaring pullbacks occurred around the past two stock-market bubbles.

Business Insider / Joe Ciolli, data from Bloomberg

The swelling of US household wealth to unprecedented levels is directly linked to the surging valuations in the stock and housing markets, which many experts say are exhibiting bubble-like behavior.

Mould says this is why the discrepancy between wealth and income has widened to such an alarming degree.

""The difference is likely to be accounted for by the surge in the value of financial and other assets — equities, bonds, property and frankly everything from vintage cars to art to wine to baseball cards,"" he said. ""And this is one warning that at some stage another collapse in financial markets will sweep around the globe.""

In addition to stretched valuations through the market, Mould is wary of rising debt levels. Not only are global debt burdens higher than they were before the last two crashes, they also make up a larger percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).

AJ Bell

So with all of these troubling elements in place, what could end up striking the death blow for markets? Mould raises the prospect of a Federal Reserve policy error as the central bank looks to increase interest rates from historically low levels.

He argues that more borrowing, combined with net worth being more linked to financial-market exposure, could make any negative impact of Fed rate hikes even worse. And that, in turn, puts increased pressure on the Fed to make the right decisions.

So as the central bank continues to tighten monetary conditions as a response to rising inflation, the risk of a mistake will continue to mount.

""The Fed seems determined to press ahead with rate hikes and the danger is that they overdo it,"" Mould said. ""Hence, Fed policy error remains the most likely candidate for a fresh tumble in markets.""","household

HONG KONG (AP) — Typhoon Mangkhut barreled into southern China on Sunday after lashing the northern Philippines with strong winds and heavy rain that left at least 36 people dead and dozens more feared buried in a landslide.

More than 2.4 million people had been relocated in southern China's Guangdong province by Sunday evening to flee the massive typhoon and nearly 50,000 fishing boats were called back to port, state media reported.

The gambling enclave of Macau closed casinos for the first time and the Hong Kong Observatory warned people to stay away from the Victoria Harbour landmark, where storm surges battered the sandbag-reinforced waterfront.

Mangkhut made landfall in the Guangdong city of Taishan at 5 p.m., packing wind speeds of 162 kilometers (100 miles) per hour. State television broadcaster CGTN reported that surging waves flooded a seaside hotel in the city of Shenzhen.

Groceries flew off the shelves of supermarkets in the provincial capital of Guangzhou as residents stocked up in preparation for being confined at home by the typhoon, China's official Xinhua News Agency said.

Authorities in southern China had issued a red alert, the most severe warning, as the national meteorological center said the densely populated region would face a ""severe test caused by wind and rain"" and urged officials to prepare for possible disasters.

Hundreds of flights were canceled. All high-speed and some normal rail services in Guangdong and Hainan provinces were also halted, the China Railway Guangzhou Group Co. said.

In Hong Kong, a video posted online by residents showed the top corner of an old building break and fall off while in another video, a tall building swayed as strong winds blew.

The storm also broke windows, felled trees, tore bamboo scaffolding off buildings under construction and flooded areas with sometimes waist-high waters, according to the South China Morning Post.

The paper said the heavy rains brought storm surges of 3 meters (10 feet) around Hong Kong.

Hong Kong Security Minister John Lee Ka-chiu urged residents to prepare for the worst.

""Because Mangkhut will bring winds and rains of extraordinary speeds, scope and severity, our preparation and response efforts will be greater than in the past,"" Lee said. ""Each department must have a sense of crisis, make a comprehensive assessment and plan, and prepare for the worst.""

Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific said all of its flights would be canceled between 2:30 a.m. Sunday and 4 a.m. Monday. The city of Shenzhen also canceled all flights between Sunday and early Monday morning. Hainan Airlines canceled 234 flights in the cities of Haikou, Sanya, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai scheduled this weekend.

In Macau, next door to Hong Kong, casinos were ordered to close from 11 p.m. Saturday, the first time such action was taken in the city, the South China Morning Post reported. Macau suffered catastrophic flooding during Typhoon Hato last year, leading to accusations of corruption and incompetence at its meteorological office.

In Macau's inner harbor district on Sunday, the water level reached 1.5 meters (5 feet) and was expected to rise further. The district was one of the most affected by floods from Typhoon Hato, which left 10 people dead.

40-50 people feared trapped in landslide

In the northern Philippines, about 40 to 50 people, mostly small-scale miners and their families, were feared to have been trapped by a landslide in the far-flung village of Ucab in Itogon town in Benguet province, Itogon Mayor Victorio Palangdan said by phone.

Palangdan said three villagers who nearly got buried by the huge pile of mud and rocks told authorities they saw residents rush into an old three-story building, a former mining bunkhouse that has been transformed into a chapel, at the height of the typhoon's onslaught Saturday afternoon.

""That was not an authorized evacuation center,"" Palangdan said, but expressed sadness that the villagers, many of them poor miners, had few options to survive in a region where big corporations have profited immensely from gold mines.

Police Superintendent Pelita Tacio said rescuers pulled out seven bodies from the huge mound of mud and rocks. She said they were scrambling to pull out the body of another victim before she left the area Sunday.

""It's very sad. I could hear villagers wailing in their homes near the site of the accident,"" Tacio said by phone.

Rescuers stopped their search intermittently because of heavy rain, and the search and rescue operation was suspended at nightfall and will resume at daybreak Monday, Palangdan said.

Overall, at least 36 people have died in typhoon-related incidents in the Philippines, mostly from landslides and collapsed houses.

Mangkhut made landfall on Saturday on the northeastern tip of Luzon island in the Philippines with sustained winds of 205 kilometers (127 mph) and gusts of 255 kph (158 mph).

The Philippines appeared to have been spared the high number of casualties many had feared. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened villages and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines. A massive evacuation ahead of Mangkhut helped lessen potential casualties, with about 87,000 people evacuating from high-risk areas, officials said.

Philippine National Police Director General Oscar Albayalde told The Associated Press that 20 people died in the Cordillera mountain region, four in nearby Nueva Vizcaya province and another outside of the two regions. Three more deaths were reported in northeastern Cagayan province, where the typhoon made landfall.

The typhoon struck at the start of the rice and corn harvesting season in the Philippines' northern breadbasket, prompting farmers to scramble to save what they could of their crops, Cagayan Gov. Manuel Mamba said.","haikou sanya guangzhou shenzhen

Its move this week to revamp its device lineup by doubling down on thousand-dollar phones, and simultaneously dropping its least expensive model, made clear that it's no longer overly concerned with appealing to customers of more limited means. Instead, the iPhone maker seems to believe that the way forward is to be the Louis Vuitton of consumer electronics.

That focus on the high-end has already started to pay off for the company in the form of near-term profits, even as it recently surged past a trillion-dollar market cap. But it could prove to be a bad bet in the longer term, particularly if it means that fewer consumers turn to Apple to purchase their first phone or other device.

Apple has always commanded a premium

Apple, of course, has always played in the more affluent end of the market. Its Mac computers have typically been more expensive than their Windows-based rivals. And its new iPhones have always carried a premium price over competing smartphones with similar performance.

But for years, particularly under former CEO Steve Jobs, the company made an effort to appeal to more mainstream consumers. When the iPod was its primary product, Apple offered models such as the Shuffle and the Nano, that had prices that put them within reach of average consumers. The iPad's $500 price was considered a bargain when it first launched. And when Apple has introduced new iPhone models, it has consistently discounted older ones, making them more accessible to a wider range of consumers.

The company seemed to be decidedly turning away from that strategy of late. Indeed, its turn to the top of the market was clear at the company's press event on Wednesday. A year after launching its first phone with a $1,000 starting price, the iPhone X, Apple introduced another thousand-dollar model to replace it, the XS, and a jumbo-sized version, the XS Max, which comes with an $1,100 starting price.

The company's other new phone, the XR, starts at $750, which looks like a bargain compared with the other two models. That appearance fades when you compare the iPhone XR with last year's lineup. The iPhone 8, which launched then as a step-down from the iPhone X, had a starting price of $700.

But Apple's move to the high-end was as pronounced by what it did behind the scenes as what it did on stage at the Steve Jobs Theater at its Cupertino, California, headquarters. While launching the new phones, Apple discontinued the iPhone SE. Its least expensive model to that point, the SE had a $350 price. Now, the least expensive phone Apple offers is the iPhone 7, which starts at $450.

Apple's move to the high-end could boost revenue

Apple's new iPhone XS models start at $1,000. Apple This boosting of prices could benefit Apple in the short term, if its recent experience is any guide. Over the last year, the revenue it saw from its smartphone sales jumped 13% from the same period a year earlier, thanks almost entirely to the higher price points on the iPhone X and other models. The average revenue Apple saw per iPhone sold in its most recent quarter was $724; two years ago, it was less than $600.

Longer term, though, this focus on the high end could weigh heavily on the company. With iPhones costing more, Apple fans are likely to hold on to their phones longer, upgrade less often, and trade down for lower priced models when they do replace their devices.

Apple has already seen stagnating demand. On an annual basis, it's sold about the same number of phones in each of the last four years. In fact, the number of phones it sold in the year-long period that ended in June was 2% fewer than the number it sold in the same period that ended in June 2015.

That stagnation has come in the middle of a booming economy with low unemployment. When the next downturn hits, that focus on the high-end could leave Apple exposed. When they're worried about their next paycheck, consumers tend to forgo luxury items.

But the bigger problem for Apple in the future could come from its decision to kill its low-end SE, rather than its introduction of higher-priced phones.

$100 matters a lot in the consumer electronics business

The $100 price difference between what Apple charged for the SE and what it now charges for the iPhone 7 may not seem like it should matter that much, but it does. As just about any market analyst will tell you, when it comes to consumer electronics products, the relationship between price and demand is generally exponential, not proportional.

The iPhone SE has been Apple's entry-level phone for the last two years. Apple In other words, if you cut the price of a given gadget in half, you'll typically see sales do a lot more than double for it. Conversely, if you double the price of a gadget, sales will fall by more than half.

Another way of putting that is that the number of consumers around the world who can afford a $450 device is a lot smaller than the number who can afford a $350 one — much smaller, in fact, than the $100 difference might indicate. Thus, by raising the price of its entry-level model, the company is writing off a large segment of potential consumers.

That could have numerous consequences, none of them good for Apple.

The smartphone market in the United States and other developed nations and even in China is fairly mature at this point. Where the market is growing is in developing countries, particularly in India.

To play in those markets, where consumers' incomes tend to be a small fraction of what they are in the US, vendors have to offer affordable phones. Even a $350 phone is priced above what many consumers in India can pay. A $450 gadget is even more out of reach.

Apple can't upsell customers if it doesn't get them in the door

But Apple's move to drop the SE could give it trouble even closer to home. As most retailers know, low-priced items can often be a good way to get customers in the door. Those devices themselves may not be terribly profitable and the retailer may not really want to sell them, but they can use them as a lure. Once they've drawn a customer in, the company has the opportunity to upsell them on pricier, more profitable items. Without them, the company never has that chance with some consumers.

One of the fastest growing parts of Apple's business in recent years has come from convincing customers to sign up for services such as Apple Music. Nick Vega That's important because Apple — as much as just about any company — relies on repeat customers. Much of its business model is about getting consumers into its ecosystem. Once they buy one Apple product, say an iPhone, they're much more likely to buy another Apple product, such as another iPhone or a Mac or an Apple Watch.

Increasingly, the company's business has been driven by convincing owners of its hardware devices to sign up for its internet-delivered services, such as Apple Music, or additional storage on its iCloud cloud offering. Apple's services business now accounts for about 14% of its total sales, and grew at a 31% clip in its most recent quarter.

If Apple fails to convinces a customer to buy that first product, the company loses out not just on that initial sale, but on all the subsequent products and services it could have sold them after the fact.

To be sure, the SE might seem like a relatively minor device. It had a small screen compared to more recent iPhones, and was based on a years-old design. But Apple really doesn't have any comparable entry-level products in its lineup right now to replace it.

Sure, you can get an Apple Watch from the company for $280 or its AirPod headphones for $160, but those are accessories. You're not going to buy either device unless you already own an iPhone — in fact, the Apple Watch requires an iPhone just to set up.

While you can now get a new iPad for $330, you're also likely not going to buy that unless you're already into Apple's ecosystem. If you really want a low-cost tablet and aren't already an Apple fan, you're much more likely to buy one of Amazon's low-cost $50 Fire devices.

So don't be surprised if Apple's move to become a luxury brand boosts its profits in the next quarter or so. But also, don't be shocked if the move ends up biting the company down the line.","cupertino california

The storm has already left at least a reported 14 people dead and knocked out power for more than a million residents.

As of Sunday morning, Florence was moving west at 8 mph, with winds at a speed of 35 mph. Hurricane categories are based on wind speed, so Florence's downgrade to a tropical depression doesn't express how dangerous the storm could be.

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned in a briefing Saturday morning that more people in the state are in danger now than when Florence made landfall there on Friday.

""The rainfall is epic and will continue to be,"" Cooper said. ""We just don't want people to think this is over, because it's not. It's not anywhere.""

Cooper warned on Sunday: ""I cannot overstate it: Floodwaters are rising, and if you aren't watching for them, you are risking your life.""

According to Duke Energy, North Carolina's main energy provider, 472,000 customers remain without power across the state as of Saturday night.

""Our crews during the past 24 hours have made significant progress restoring power in areas of the Carolinas where it is safe to do,"" said Duke Energy incident commander Howard Fowler.

""However, we unfortunately have been unable to make repairs in some of the hardest-hit coastal areas due to continuing high winds and road access problems caused by major flooding,"" he added.

The death toll rises

The storm has killed at least 14 people, according to The New York Times. Authorities expect the death toll to rise in the coming days.

A mother and baby died when a tree crashed into their home, the Wilmington Police Department said on Twitter Friday afternoon. A 78-year-old man was killed while trying to connect extension cords outside in the rain, ABC News reported, citing Lenoir County Emergency Services Director Roger Dail.

Another man was blown away by strong winds while outside checking on his dogs. The man's family found his body Friday morning, according to Dail.

The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Raleigh, North Carolina, also confirmed Saturday that an 81-year-old man in Wayne County fell and fatally struck his head while packing to evacuate the previous day, according to the Associated Press.

The office also said a husband and wife died in a house fire on Friday in Cumberland County.

President Donald Trump tweeted out condolences to the families of the dead on Saturday, mistakenly saying there were only five deaths after authorities had already raised the toll.

""Five deaths have been recorded thus far with regard to hurricane Florence! Deepest sympathies and warmth go out to the families and friends of the victims. May God be with them!"" Trump tweeted.

The storm was also a factor in the death of a woman who suffered a heart attack since emergency crews couldn't reach her due to a fallen tree, as The Wall Street Journal reported.

The water is the biggest threat

On Sunday, the center of the storm is hovering over central South Carolina, after making landfall at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, on Friday.

But the wind is not the main threat to people and property from the storm; it's the storm surge and rainfall, which combined have caused serious flooding in the low-lying coastal regions of the Carolinas.

""The flood danger from storm is more immediate today than when it made landfall 24 hrs ago,"" North Carolina Emergency Management said on Twitter Saturday. ""We face walls of water. More ppl now face a threat than when the storm was offshore. Flood waters are rising, & if you aren't watching for them, you are risking life.""

In total, Florence is forecast to dump about 18 trillion gallons of rain over North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Maryland before the storm is over. That's enough water to fill the Chesapeake Bay or to cover the state of Texas in 4 inches.

And the deluge is not even close to over — parts of North Carolina are set to receive another 15 inches of rain in the coming days, according to The National Weather Service. That means the storm could easily drop 40 inches of rain in some spots.

As of Sunday morning, the storm had dumped over 30 inches of rain in parts of North Carolina. Swansboro, a town near North Carolina's coast, received 30.59 inches of rainfall, setting a record for tropical storm-associated rainfall in the state, meteorologist David Roth said.

After hundreds were trapped in New Bern, a town on the Neuse River that was hit hard by rain and flooding, 455 people were rescued on Saturday, NBC reported.

""Nobody expected this,"" a rescued resident, Tom Ballance, told The Weather Channel. ""We were fools.""

Flash flooding risk

Life-threatening, catastrophic flash floods and prolonged, significant river flooding will continue to be the greatest risk in the coming days, according to The National Hurricane Center.

In addition to flash flooding, The National Hurricane Center warned on Sunday that landslides are also possible in the mountainous areas across Western North Carolina and Virginia.

The map below shows where the greatest risk of flooding is:

The agent, Juan David Ortiz, was captured after a woman whom he tried to abduct escaped, Webb County District Attorney Isidro Alaniz said at a news conference. Sheriff Martin Cuellar said Ortiz fled from state troopers and was found hiding in the parking lot of a hotel in Laredo, a border city about 145 miles southwest of San Antonio.

""We do consider this to be a serial killer,"" Alaniz said.

Ortiz has confessed to the four murders and one abduction, according to Eduardo Chapa, a spokesman for the Webb County Sheriff's Office. Customs and Border Protection officials have confirmed Ortiz is a supervisory Border Patrol agent.

Alaniz said investigators are still trying to determine a motive for the killings. He said all of the women worked as prostitutes.

Cuellar said investigators have ""very strong evidence"" that Ortiz is responsible for the deaths of the four women. But authorities declined to discuss the evidence or say how the women were killed.

The Texas Rangers began investigating after the body of 29-year-old Melissa Ramirez was found September 4, according to the Laredo Morning Times.

Then, on Thursday, 42-year-old Claudine Anne Luera was found in critical condition just off a roadway, close to where Ramirez's was found. Authorities found the third and fourth bodies Friday night and Saturday afternoon, respectively.

Alaniz said authorities were planning on filing four murder charges and one charge of aggravated kidnapping against Ortiz.

Andrew Meehan, CBP's assistant commissioner for public affairs, said in a statement that the agency is fully cooperating with investigators.

""Our sincerest condolences go out to the victims' family and friends,"" Meehan said. ""While it is CBP policy to not comment on the details of an ongoing investigation, criminal action by our employees is not, and will not be tolerated.""","webb county sheriffs office

Ever since his infamous go-private tweet broke, however, an alarming new element has been added to the criticism of Musk. The argument edges into suggesting that he's done things that are somehow morally wrong, rather than ethically questionable. He should, therefore, be punished, perhaps by the SEC, certainly by the markets.

This is nonsense. If Musk wanted to attempt to take Tesla private, as the CEO and owner of 20% of the company, he was entitled to both give it a shot and fail trying. That's just business. The scoldings look pretty Church Lady, as if Musk should go on TV an profess contrition and promise to never be bad again.

As an early investor in companies like Uber and Airbnb, Ashton Kutcher is used to entrepreneurs asking him, or at least his firm Sound Ventures, for some investment capital.

At TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco, Kutcher explained onstage the key to piquing his interest -- and it largely has to do with how well an entrepreneur can spin a compelling narrative.

""One of the critical tests that I try to run when I'm sitting across from a founder is: Can you sell me your idea?"" said Kutcher.

For Kutcher, the ability to convey a company's mission determines whether or not they'll be able to snag the best talent in a competitive job market.

""If you can't sell me, how are you going to sell your first hire, your second hire, your third hire?"" Kutcher asked. ""How are you going to create the capacity for the rest of your team to sell those next hires?""

He continued, ""For early stage companies, generally the CEO of the company has to hire the first 40 people ... If you're competing for the best talent in the world and you can't sell your idea to the best talent in the world, how are you going to get all A players around you to turn this into an explosive company? If at the end of the conversation [you] can't sell me to work for you, how are you going to sell your first 50 employees?""

Kutcher described this ability to tell the story of an early stage company as integral to its future growth.

""I think the storytelling piece has to happen,"" he said. ""You can refine it and make it better and improve it and figure out how to communicate it to a consumer over time, but [for] early stage companies, that person has to do all of those things.""","airbnb ashton kutcher

Business Insider/Mary Hanbury

Zara may have grown up, but it never really left home.

The clothing chain has been based in Galicia, on the northwest coast of Spain, since 1975. But what started out as just one store has grown into an enormous, multi-national business that is considered to be the largest fashion retailer on the planet, turning out over $30 billion in sales a year.

Despite this, Zara has always stayed true to its roots, and its billionaire founder, Amancio Ortega, has continued to expand its global headquarters in Galicia to accommodate its growth.

To do so, the company has brought in thousands of employees from different parts of the world to work on its design, photography, sales, and e-commerce strategy. This has had a dramatic impact on the culture of the nearby city of La Coruña, where many of these employees choose to live.

The locals call it the ""Impacto Inditex,"" and it's felt in all areas of the city. Whether it be the fashionistas that roam the streets, dipping in and out of its trendy stores, cafes, and bars, or the disgruntled residents who say they face rising living costs, it's clear that Inditex is having a profound impact on life in La Coruña, for better or worse.

We visited the city in August to see how much it has changed with the rise of Zara:","impacto inditex

But it's not through with us yet. From drinking milk to fending off disease, humans are still evolving new traits that help us survive and thrive in a changing world. Following is a transcript of the video.

On the outside, it may seem like we haven't changed much from our early ancestors. But take a closer look and you'll discover that humans are still evolving in some fascinating new ways.

HOLDING YOUR BREATH

The average person can hold their breath for 30 seconds. But Bajau people in Southeast Asia can hold it up to 12 minutes! Which comes in handy when they freedive over 230 feet for food.

Part of the reason is simply training and experience, since they spend over half their work day underwater But it turns out the Bajau also have a genetic mutation that makes their spleens 50% larger than average.

Our spleens are what filter and store oxygen-rich red blood cells. So, when the Bajau dive underwater their larger spleens contract, which boosts oxygen levels in the blood by up to 10%, allowing them more time to collect food. It's a handy adaptation that probably came from living on houseboats for the last 1,000 years.

DRINKING MILK

About 35% of the world's population has the equivalent of a genetic superpower: They can digest milk as adults. Not impressed? Then consider this: humans are the ONLY mammals on the planet with this ability.

Thanks to a genetic mutation that popped up in Europe around 5 to 10 thousand years ago. Those with the mutation produce lactase throughout their lives. That's the enzyme that breaks down milk sugars for easy digestion.

All other mammals, and humans for most of history, stop producing it after childhood.

But once those lucky few Europeans could drink milk as adults, that suddenly meant extra nutrition and ultimately healthier, longer lives so that they could pass their superpower on to future generations.

Today, roughly 95% of Northern Europeans have the mutation.

FENDING OFF DISEASE

The human body has an estimated 20 to 30 thousand genes. And while some mutations can change our spleens and diet others can protect us against deadly conditions, like AIDS.

Nearly 50% of women in parts of South Africa have HIV. But researchers found that some show a stronger resistance to the virus taking longer to develop AIDS, or sometimes never getting it at all.

Turns out, these women also share a mutation in a gene called HLA-B27, that the others lack.

Does this mean we're going to evolve our way to HIV immunity? It's too early to say. But one thing's clear:

Evolution's not done with us yet.","southeast asia

Gov. Charlie Baker and other officials announced the move at a morning news conference and said electricity was restored to nearly all affected homes and businesses in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover. Gas service will remain shut off while officials continue investigating what caused Thursday's explosions and fires, and crews inspect the gas lines and connections to homes.

Dozens of homes were destroyed or damaged, a teenager was killed and dozens of people were injured. Thousands of residents were forced to evacuate. Crews have shut off nearly 8,600 gas meters in the area and cleared homes of any gas.

Officials said gas company technicians will turn all the meters back after safety inspections of the entire system are complete — a process expected to take several weeks. They warned residents not to turn the meters back on themselves, not to turn on gas appliances until service is restored and to call 911 and leave their homes if they smell gas.

""It's evident to me and to all of us the Merrimack Valley and the residents of our state are being as supportive as they can be and as kind as they can be to one another during this most difficult time,"" the Republican governor said. ""We still have a very long way to go but we're very happy that people can return to their homes this morning.""

WBZ-TV

Firefighters in Lawrence responded to a fire at an apartment complex Sunday morning after residents had returned, but officials said it wasn't related to the gas problem.

National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt said Saturday that there was no evidence to suggest the explosions were intentional.

He said investigators will be looking at how local Columbia Gas officials responded to a ""pressure increase"" in the Lawrence area that was detected at the company's pipeline control center in Columbus, Ohio, prior to the explosions and fires.

Government records reveal at least three other serious explosions in Massachusetts, West Virginia and Ohio have been linked to Columbia Gas. The company a subsidiary of NiSource, a utility company that serves more than three million customers in seven states.

Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera became emotional at the news conference while thanking people for support and donations to the Lawrence Emergency Fund.

""People have been very generous,"" he said. ""And usually, when we have issues like this, it's really hard to come up with cash because it's mostly stuff out of people's hands. So the fact that we were able to raise $100,000 in two days is heartwarming. It makes us very thankful.""","gas problem national transportation safety board

""We are aware of the offensive video on twitter - the Coast Guard has identified the member and removed him from the response,"" the agency wrote on Twitter after a clip of the gesture caused social media uproar. ""His actions do not reflect those of the United States Coast Guard.""

The employee, who hasn't been identified, made the sign during an MSNBC interview Friday with another Coast Guard member. The man can be seen in the background of an aid center staring directly into the camera before shaping his hands to make an ""OK"" sign — a move that has recently been adopted by white supremacists. He appeared to try hiding the gesture by making it look like he was scratching his face or hair.

@AngryBlackLady Just saw this on MSNBC during interview with Coast Guard. Check out white-power in background. @uscoastguard pic.twitter.com/G7HcgDb649 — Eunice Burns (@TheEuniceBurns) September 14, 2018

The Coast Guard has not denied that the officer intentionally made the white supremacist sign. The agency did not immediately return messages from CBS News.

The hand signal gained popularity in 2017 as an inside joke among white supremacists online, who wrote about tricking liberals and the media into thinking the popular ""OK"" gesture had been co-opted by far-right groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League. But the joke eventually turned serious as white supremacists groups and figures, such as Richard Spencer, continued to pose with the gesture in photos and spread its use on social media.

The Coast Guard controversy comes just days after social media users accused Zina Bash, an attorney and Republican operative, of making the gesture on camera while sitting behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings. Bash's husband John Bash, a U.S. Attorney in Texas, said she was simply resting her hand and called the accusation ""repulsive.""

""Everyone tweeting this vicious conspiracy theory should be ashamed of themselves,"" Bash wrote in a now-deleted tweet. ""We weren't even familiar with the hateful symbol being attributed to her for the random way she rested her hand during a long hearing.""","united states coast guard

An independent study by researchers at George Washington University commissioned by the Puerto Rican government estimated nearly 3,000 people died because of the storm, a figure the president has disputed.

""There's a big discrepancy, whether it's direct deaths or indirect deaths. If you look at the root cause of any problem, is one, around here, one death is a death too many. We work everyday to try to prevent that,"" Long said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""But if you want to get into Puerto Rico from the standpoint of what needs to happen next, you've got to fix aging infrastructure that wasn't ready to support the commonwealth before that storm hit, and when they were blown out it exponentially causes problems on the back end.""

According to the independent analysis by researchers at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, an estimated 2,975 more deaths than normal were recorded on the island from September 2017 to February 2018. The government had previously put the official death toll at 64. A study by Harvard University released in May estimated that Maria was responsible for the deaths of more than 4,600 people.

Mr. Trump defended his administration's response Maria in a tweet last week, disputing the latest study's findings. Mr. Trump claimed that the study was ""done by the Democrats"" in order to make him look ""as bad as possible."" His comments received widespread backlash from leaders in Puerto Rico and on Capitol Hill.

""Puerto Rico is a very vulnerable place right now. We're focused on putting billions of dollars of work to prevent this and build it more resilient sure it doesn't happen again,"" he said.

Long is spearheading recovery efforts from Hurricane Florence as it continues to batter the Carolinas. He's also weathering his own storm stemming from an internal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) inspector general over his use of government vehicles for commuting between North Carolina and Washington.

Reports by Politico and the Wall Street Journal claimed that DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had asked for Long's resignation amid concerns over his lengthy commutes back home, something Long disputes ever happened.

""I've never been asked to resign. Secretary Nielsen and I talk everyday, we have a very professional functional relationship,"" said Long, noting that the vehicles he used were equipped with ""secure comms"" under a program developed long before he became FEMA chief.

""We comply every day. We'll make meaningful changes,"" Long said. ""I have never made — I would never intentionally violate any rules that I was aware of.""","department of homeland securitys dhs

Thom Tillis says he's ""shocked"" that the allegations of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett Kavanaugh did not come up in his days-long Supreme Court confirmation hearings.

On ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Tillis, who is on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he had not seen a letter sent by an unnamed female accuser to her congresswoman, Rep. Anna Eshoo. On Thursday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, confirmed the existence of the letter.

According to The New Yorker, the letter described an alleged incident when Kavanaugh and the woman were both minors at different high schools in the D.C. area in the 1980s. The New Yorker reported the letter claims that Kavanaugh unsuccessfully attempted to force himself on her at a high school party.

""I believe that the member that first received that letter was as late as July, and quite honestly, I'm shocked that the matter didn't come up in the nearly 32 hours of testimony that Judge Kavanaugh was before us, in the open sessions or the nearly hour, hour and a half session that we had in a closed session,"" Tillis said Sunday. ""That information never came up.""

Tillis said that that committee intends to look into the matter upon returning to Washington this week, but ""it really raises a question in my mind about, if this was material to the confirmation process, why on Earth, over the past four to six weeks, hasn't it been discussed among the committee members?""

Tillis also questioned the timing of the letter's existence becoming public, and why the letter's author would not come forward in a confidential setting.

Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations against him. Tillis said he still expects the Senate to move forward with Kavanaugh's confirmation before October. The committee moved to delay the first round of votes on his confirmation for one week.

Meanwhile, Tillis says his home state of North Carolina is ""doing as well as it can"" to deal with record-breaking rain from Florence, a weather event that he believes will exceed the damage Hurricane Matthew inflicted just two years ago.

Tillis said as rain bands continue to pummel the Charlotte area and move up through the mountain region, and that it will be ""matter of days before we see the full effects of this storm."" The senator said FEMA assets were ""positioned as well as they could be"" in advance of Florence's landfall and commended the efforts of organizations like the Red Cross to provide assistance to displaced residents.","senate judiciary committee

More recently she's faced, and overcome, a daunting series of misfortunes and disappointments. She talks with our Tracy Smith For The Record:

She's only 35, but Carrie Underwood has already had a lifetime of success. She's sold 64 million records and won seven Grammys, with a voice that's been called the best of her generation.

Smith met her last month at the high church of country music, Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, and the place was packed to the rafters.

""See, this makes me nervous – not you?"" Smith said.

""You can go sing, if you want,"" said Underwood.

""No, thank you. I'll leave that to you.""

Underwood is expecting her second child, but she still did two shows that night, and as always, she managed to make it all look easy.

Smith asked, ""Was there a point where you thought, 'This has gotta stop, like, this winning streak has to end at some point'?""

""I've had a good life, and you can't win all the time,"" Underwood replied. ""You gotta have some downs to realize when you're up.""

And she's definitely had her share of downs.

Her story began in the ""single stoplight town"" of Checotah, Oklahoma, population around 3,000. It's typical enough, except for that big green sign just off the interstate that reads, ""Checotah, home of CARRIE UNDERWOOD American Idol 2005.""

Underwood grew up here, the youngest of three girls. She's always loved animals, even helped build a local shelter, Happy Paws, where her mom Carole's a volunteer. ""We don't have a bad dog here,"" Carole said. ""We hardly have ever had a bad dog here.""

Though she's been gone since 2001, it seems a part of her never left. When asked if there are things she's missed about Checotah, she replied, ""Oh, yeah. I feel like this is the only place that my soul can rest.

CBS News

""It's just when I come here, I can turn off. And there's no other place in world that's like that. And I feel like everybody's got that place. Everybody's got that home feel. But it's like, I sleep when I'm here. Like, I sleep. And I don't get that anyplace else.""

Still, there was a world beyond Checotah. At Northeastern State University she sang a bit with a country music group, and majored in journalism, with her sights on a career in TV news.

But that all changed in the summer of 2004, when she tried out for ""American Idol."" Her mom, Carole, said, ""I was hoping through 'American Idol' that at least she would get some face recognition, so she might get a job at one of the news stations or something in Tulsa.""

That was the hope. And then, this happened:

Winning ""American Idol"" was like launching a country music moon-rocket. She made a hit album, and then a few more. She toured the world, and the awards started piling up.

She also got married, in 2010, to NHL hockey star Mike Fisher; had a little boy, Isaiah; started a workout wear line, Calia; and learned to enjoy her stardom, and all that went with it.

But just when it seemed that all was perfect, life threw her a curve. Last November she tripped outside her Nashville home, and landed on her face.

""My face broke my fall,"" Underwood said.

""You joke about it now,"" said Smith. ""But it was how many stitches?""

""They said between 40 and 50.""

But as bad as that fall was, it was almost trivial compared to the personal agony she endured last year, all while working on a new album called, appropriately enough, ""Cry Pretty.""

Capitol Nashville

She told her fans she'd wanted to get the title track right because, ""It speaks to a lot of things that have happened in this past year.""

Smith asked, ""What'd you mean by that?""

""Here we go. Oh, lawdy! 2017 just wasn't how I imagined it,"" she said.

In what way? ""I'd kind of planned that 2017 was, you know, going to be the year that I work on new music, and I have a baby. We got pregnant early 2017, and didn't work out.""

""Oh, I'm so sorry.""

""Yeah. It happens. And that was the thing, in the beginning it was like, 'Okay, God, we know this is, just wasn't Your timing. And that is all right. We will bounce back and figure our way through it.' And got pregnant again in the spring, and it didn't work out.

""Got pregnant again, early 2018. Didn't work out. So, at that point, it was just kind of like, 'Okay, like, what's the deal? What is all of this?'

""And throughout the whole process, you know, I'm writing and, like, literally right after finding out that I would lose a baby, I'd have a writing session, I'd be like, 'Let's go. You know, I can't just sit around thinking about this. Like, I wanna work, I wanna do this.'

""'Cause I would literally have these horrible things going on in my life, and then have to go smile and, like, do some interviews or, like, do a photo shoot or something, you know? So it was just kind of, like, therapeutic, I guess.""

And, Underwood says, it could also be excruciating.

""This is what the song's about – that you put this face on for the world,"" said Smith.

""And sometimes you just can't,"" she laughed.

I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl

Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world

I'm pretty good at keeping it together

I hold my composure, for worse or for better

So I apologize if you don't like what you see

But sometimes my emotions get the best of me

And falling apart is as human as it gets

You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

– ""Cry Pretty""

Smith asked, ""Was there a point when you're like, looking up, going, 'What are you doing to me?'""

""I had always been afraid to be angry,"" Underwood said. ""Because we are so blessed. And my son, Isaiah, is the sweetest thing. And he's the best thing in the world. And I'm like, 'If we can never have any other kids, that's okay, because he's amazing.' And I have this amazing life. Like, really, what can I complain about? I can't. I have an incredible husband, incredible friends, an incredible job, an incredible kid. Can I be mad? No.

""And I got mad.""

Then one night, after what she thought was another miscarriage, she says she prayed like never before.

""Mike was away just for the evening, and I texted him, and I was like, 'I don't really want to be alone, so I'm just gonna go snuggle with Isaiah.' And I don't know how I didn't wake him up, but I was just sobbing,"" Underwood said. ""And I was like, 'Why on Earth do I keep getting pregnant if I can't have a kid? Like, what is this? Shut the door. Like, do something. Either shut the door or let me have a kid.'

""And for the first time, I feel like I actually I told God how I felt. And I feel, like, we're supposed to do that. That was like a Saturday – and the Monday I went to the doctor to, like, confirm, another miscarriage. And they told me everything was great!

""And I was like, 'You heard me.' Not that He hasn't in the past. But maybe, I don't know, He heard me.""

""God heard your prayer?""

""He did.""

Looking at her now, you'd never guess anything was ever wrong.

She'll go on tour this spring – hopefully, she says, with her new baby in tow. It seems Carrie Underwood waded through a year of despair, and found something beautiful.

""I feel like there's a lot of songs, there's several songs on the album that came from that, you know, or I connect with in a totally different way because of those experiences that we went through,"" she said. ""And they were hard. And it sucked so much! But things are looking better.""

It's not uncommon to see that people in New York City have left their marks on the side of a building … until you realize where that building is.

""I'm literally living out every graffiti artist's dream,"" said Dylan Bauvez. ""I'm up there painting what I hold closest to myself legally here in the heart of New York City, where New York's heart was broken.""

The World Trade Center is undergoing a transformation, by way of street art. Bauvez calls his mural ""Wild Things,"" and dedicates it to his sister and mother who are fighting cancer.

CBS News

He showed Salie his Twin Towers tattoo. ""I was in the fourth grade when it happened. And my mother was supposed to be here that day, but she called in sick and she didn't show up. And then the next time she ever showed up to the World Trade Center grounds was to see my painting on the fence. She got to come see it, and it was an emotional thing.""

All across this construction zone – more than 20,000 square feet of corrugated metal – every surface tells a story of mystery, acceptance, and love.

CBS News

One, painted by artists Chinon Maria and Sebastian Mitre, blooms audaciously in the shadow of the 9/11 Memorial. Its flowers suggest new life and hope. ""You want to do something that honors the area, that brings hope, that brings life to a place that has gone through such tragedy,"" said Maria.

""That is a key word: rebirth,"" added Mitre.

CBS News

Reviving this site, one can of spray paint at a time, even from 30 feet in the air.

CBS News

For developer Larry Silverstein, the images that bathe his buildings illustrate just how far he's come … and how much further he has to go. The graffiti, he told Salie, ""brings life, it brings zest, it brings activity, it brings a feeling of togetherness: Hey, we're part of something that's wonderful.""

The art project started when earlier this year the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey asked Silverstein to liven up his construction zone.

""You could have hired anyone – why did you choose street art?"" Salie asked.

""Maybe because it was the coolest kind of art we could find!"" Silverstein laughed. ""And I'm saying this to you as an 87-year-old guy!""

CBS News

""What is it, Larry? What's 'cool'?""

""It's this art. Look at it, enjoy it, take from it, and be blessed by it.""

""Decades ago, businesses would never want someone spray painting their construction sites, right? That would be vandalism. And you're going out and buying the spray paint cans for these artists?""

""And saying, 'You all come!'""

CBS News

""The things that we previously were scared about, we now embrace for its beauty,"" said Alejandro Velasco, who teaches an ""Art and Politics in the City"" course at New York University's Gallatin School. ""The question is, how can we preserve the aesthetics without using some of its politics? That's the real challenge of street art in the 21st century.""

Velasco says graffiti emerged in New York City in the 1960s as a way for impoverished groups to find visibility, to literally make their mark in society.

Turns out, graffiti goes way back. Velasco says that when Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés was plundering the Americas in the 1500s, graffiti offered expression to his otherwise silenced soldiers.

""They would paint messages on the walls of his palace,"" Velasco said. ""And he would write back on the wall. So, this became a site where they would exchange opinions.""

And closer to our own time, remember those pictures of New York in the 1960s, when impoverished artists quite literally used almost anything to make their mark?

CBS News

""It's fascinating to realize that graffiti is sort of like an early version of social media: Hear me. I get to have a voice,"" said Salie.

And it's social media, say artists Stickymonger, Boogie, and Todd Gray, that's helping spread the popularity of this public palette. ""The pictures that they take with it, they jump with it. The action, the motions that they give. It's everybody's artwork. We all made it together,"" Boogie said.

Still, for all the joy their art brings, the artists say they haven't forgotten their canvas is hallowed ground.

For all the joy this art brings to its audience, the artists will never forget the history of their canvas.

""To have all these murals, to me they're just these metaphors of wildflowers, just kind of growing through the rubble,"" said Gray.

Chinon Maria got emotional saying, ""You think about the location and how it is our job to really focus in and create something to respect all the lives that were lost, and to know that there is hope and there is a way for us to all unite together, and that is through the arts.""

Salie asked, ""Does art heal?""

""Absolutely,"" said Bauvez.

""In so many ways,"" added Boogie. ""Mind, body and soul.""

Robert Redford just wouldn't look right … [+6778 chars]","The Academy Award winner – whose latest film, ""The Old Man & the Gun,"" is his last as an actor – says he doesn't relish the word ""retirement""",2018-09-15T17:46:44+00:00,cbs-news,"Robert Redford: ""There's only the trying""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/robert-redford-theres-only-the-trying/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/09/16/28a1b6ef-79a7-4efb-a95f-6a7fb5f22830/thumbnail/1200x630/bc9e11653a668e176072fdcb1a6d4212/robert-redford-sunglasses-promo.jpg,general,2018-09-16 14:23:31.214622,"He's a Hollywood Legend. Those of you who tuned in for our Friday night special, saw some of Lee Cowan's chat with Robert Redford. But we wanted more. Which is why, happily, this morning their conversation continues...

Robert Redford just wouldn't look right in a city. He's spent most of his life in places with more rocks than people, like his 250-acre ranch outside Santa Fe, New Mexico.

""You can see why this had impact on me,"" he said. ""When I saw that and I realized, well, there was a great part of America that used to look that way. But there's less and less of it now. So, why don't I buy some land here where I can preserve at least this view?""

His love of nature is as much his signature as his windswept hair.

But it's perhaps one scene from one of his most famous movies, ""Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid,"" that best sums up how Redford has lived his life:

Sundance Kid, gunfighter: ""Can I move?

Man: ""Move? What the hell ya' mean, move?""

Sundance shoots, hits his target.

""Sundance Kid: ""I'm better when I move.""

Cowan asked, ""Is that true for you in real life?""

""Yeah, I think so. I like movement. I always have.""

At 82, he says it's time to move on from acting. ""It's hard for me to hear that when you say it might be your last [role],"" Cowan said.

""It's hard for me to say it!"" Redford replied. ""You don't like talking about your end. I mean, who does? I can't do this forever. I've been doing it since I was 21. As you move into your 80s, you say, hey, that's enough, that's enough.""

It's not exactly retirement; he'll still direct and produce. But as far as big screen performances, he says, it's time to go.

His last role offers one more chance to show off his charm and wry smile.

In ""The Old Man & the Gun,"" he plays an aging bank robber on the run. The story is based on a real man, Forrest Tucker, who started robbing banks as a teenager in the late 1930s and never stopped.

""This is not only a true story, but I can connect with it very, very easily, because of the whole idea of an outlaw,"" Redford said. ""I think probably I must've been born with an outlaw sensibility, in terms of my nature, yeah. Because from the time I was just a little kid, I was always wanting to go away from the rules. I wanted to – I didn't want to break any, I just didn't want to be held by them. In kindergarten, I ran away three times!""

He was born in Santa Monica, Calif., in the shadow of Hollywood, but had no interest in movies as a career.

""I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood,"" he said. ""We'd go to matinees, any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, 'Oh boo, you tell 'em lover,' you know, and make fun of the scene. Suddenly, the idea that I would be that guy is just too much for me to take!""

He, of course, came to define what a leading man was – full of character and charisma. The camera loved him.

Cowan said, ""I'd read where you said, as the success got bigger and bigger, that you felt a certain danger in the air. What was the danger?""

""Success,"" said Redford. ""I think success is a double-edged sword. You want to shadowbox with it, but you don't want to embrace it or dance too close.""

""Obviously, good looks are not something to be shy about, but did you feel that sometimes people were looking at that instead of looking at the work?""

""Yeah. I did. And in the beginning, it was a surprise to me, because I didn't see myself that way.""

""You didn't see yourself as good-looking?""

""No, no, no, I didn't.""

""Really?""

""So therefore, when it happened, I was kind of taken back. And I thought, well, I guess it could be worse.""

Redford starred in hit after hit, but many of those films he's never watched. Cowan asked, ""How many have you not seen?""

""I don't know. I haven't ever counted 'em, but a lot. 'Cause I thought if I look at myself too much, I'm gonna be too aware of myself and that means when I go to do something new, I won't be able to do it without being slightly aware of what I'm doing rather than just being free. How about you? How do you feel about it? You must see yourself on these shows as the interviewer.""

""You know, I've got to be honest, I don't watch myself, either,"" Cowan said.

""Then we have that in common. This is really great!""

""You really don't like anything you've done?""

""Not much,"" Redford said.

""Really?""

""Uh-huh.""

""Because?""

""I guess it has a lot to do with, you do something, then move on.""

He moved on to directing, where he won an Oscar for ""Ordinary People."" Its tale of depression wasn't an easy lift, but that's what Redford was looking for – something different.

He produced and acted in ""All the President's Men,"" which was another hard sell. ""Watergate: The Movies"" was an idea few relished, including the publisher of The Washington Post, Katharine Graham, who begged Redford not to make it. ""She said, 'Okay, I can't stop you from making the film, but, please, do not have me in it. You have to honor me that.' So I said, 'Okay, I will.'

""When she saw the film, she said, 'I'm sorry I told you not to have me in the film!'"" he laughed.

Cowan asked, ""With all the political involvement that you've had over your career, I've never seen you stump for any individual candidate.""

""No.""

""Why is that?""

""I think I first learned that when I was just starting out. I was an actor who was suddenly being asked to appear with candidates that were political. I thought, 'Wow, that's an honor, somebody wants to have me stand up there with them.' No; they wanted me there to attract a crowd. I realized I was being used. So, okay, no more of this.""

""Did you ever think of running for anything yourself?""

""No. That would be a disaster!""

He's had great success as a protector of independent film. His Sundance Institute, in Utah, and later the Sundance Film festival, became the garden from which many Oscar-winning independent films grew.

Redford says he didn't expect Sundance to grow into what it has become: ""I didn't think it would last past two or three years.""

It's almost too big now, he confesses, at least for a man as private as Redford. Like most things, he's proud of it, but that's about as far as he'll go.

He's fond of a saying by T.S. Eliot: ""'There's only the trying. The rest is not our business.' It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.""

For a man so at home in the mountains, it seems he's enjoyed the climb more than his time at the summit, but easing into retirement, he admits the view from the top wasn't half-bad.

""At a certain point, I was getting so much attention that I began to think, Hey, I guess maybe I am a pretty big deal!"" he laughed.

When we first met way back in 1987, my hair was bright red and my children were, well, actual children. You've met my daughter, Libby … my son, Willie … my wife, Jody … my grandkids … my dog … even my brother-in-law. (""How'd he get in there?"")

Over the past 31 years we've become quite close, you and I.

You've joined us for the holidays, like members of the family. We donned our holiday fashions … took our cats to have their Christmas photos taken with Santa … and made Christmas decorations, just like Martha!

But mainly, we've been on the road together, hitting major attractions, venturing far off the beaten path, for competitive stone skipping.

We went to the Four Corners, where Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado meet.

Together we took a 5,600-mile cross-country RV trip. And how could we pass up the opportunity to see Albert, the world's largest bull? Or the chance to taste the worst apple pie?

And there was our stop at a brothel in Pahrump, Nevada! My fantasy: to get the bugs off the windshield. $300 for them to scrub away, plus a $1.50 for Windex.

CBS News

We've visited fine museums you may have missed in your own travels, and introduced you to American art nouveau, like a ""Last Supper"" made entirely of dryer lint.

CBS News

And to cutting-edge artists. In Iowa we met Duffy Lyon, who sculpted in butter; and in Wisconsin we watched professional cow photographer Kathy DeBruin at work.

When critics say the media doesn't cover rural America, don't look at us. We've gone to skads of small towns!

How small? The sign at Monowi, Nebraska, boasted a population of 2! But they exaggerated. It was really just one, Elsie.

In Hanlontown, Iowa, we joined in as they celebrated the day the sun sets in the middle of the railroad tracks, and the rails glowed like molten steel.

When tragedy struck on September 11, together we grieved the loss of family and friends and neighbors in my hometown.

The town of Hendersonville, North Carolina, came together to send aging World War II veterans on free trips to Washington, D.C., to set eyes on the monument built to them for saving the world.

We were in Ketchum, Idaho, as the sheep came down from the mountains, through the town, as they do every year.

Along the way met people who pass the time with some odd hobbies, like collecting old washing machines, or toasters!

And while we're on the subject of appliances, remember the vacuum cleaner collectors?

In Fruita, Colorado, we celebrated Mike the Headless Chicken, who survived nearly two years without his noggin, and went on a nationwide tour.

In Nederland, Colorado, we paid tribute to a grandfather buried under a big pile of ice in a backyard shed, at Frozen Dead Guy Days.

America loves contests and competitions. Punkin Chunkin, in Lewes, Delaware, where contestants vied to see who can shoot pumpkins the farthest.

In Luling, Texas, it was who can eat watermelons the fastest. (Not me!) Beaver, Oklahoma, the Napa Valley of cow chips, held the World Cow Chip tossing Championship. Buda, Texas, where we saw thoroughbred weiner dogs at the races, with all their speed and grace. And who can forget figure eight school bus racing in Bithlo, Florida?

We were happy to introduce you to sports that have been slow to catch on, frankly – Donkey Basketball (a little-known fact: The Amish love donkey basketball!); extreme ironing; and in San Jose, Calif., underwater hockey.

Sure, we spent a lot of time on the road. But I can't complain. There was that night in a Wigwam motel, and in a hotel made of ice. (It's cool!)

And who can forget our romantic stay in a room with a giant champagne-glass tub?

And we traveled by every conceivable mode of transportation: Micro cars, that were cramped, yes, but no more searching for a parking spot at the supermarket.

And we took to the skies in Loyalton, California, where 93-year-old pilot and paperboy Hal Wright jump-started his old plane and took us along on his paper route. We delivered mail, too, by horseback, down the walls of the Grand Canyon.

And wherever we went, we sampled the local cuisine – road kill stew in Lawrence, Kansas; in Madison, Minnesota, Lutefiske (fish soaked in Lye). It's a wonder those people are still alive!

Not to mention the customers of this place: the Heart Attack Grill in Tempe, Arizona.

We went to State Fairs, where you can always find the latest breakthroughs in fatal foods. Who knew that ""deep fat fried butter"" was even possible?

In 1987 Charles Kuralt called me and said, ""Come on and join us, it'll be fun."" He was so right! I hope it's been fun for all of you, too.

U.S. Marshals, the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service have been searching for 27-year-old Shawn Christy of McAdoo for more than two months, saying he has threatened to use ""full lethal force on any law enforcement officer that tries to detain me.""

State police in Luzerne County said the truck was reported stolen at 12:30 a.m. Sunday from the Skitco Iron Works in Hazle Township, from which Christy is believed to have stolen food, money and a shotgun.

""Federal agents are considering Christy a suspect in this vehicle theft because Christy is believed to have burglarized the same business on Sept. 5th and was known to still be in the immediate area,"" the U.S. Marshals said in a statement Sunday.

A federal warrant was issued June 19 for Christy in relation to Facebook threats against Northampton County's district attorney, alleging that he posted ""I promise I'll put a bullet in your head as soon as I put one in the head of President Donald J. Trump.""

Christy is also wanted in Pennsylvania on arrest warrants for burglary, probation violation, and failure to appear for an aggravated assault case.

The Maple Shade, New Jersey native's parents said Thursday that Christy sent a Facebook message to them saying he ""was slowed down a bit"" after he may have broken his knee during a Maryland ""getaway."" The message ends: ""Stay safe, I have a mission to complete.""

Federal authorities have asked for help for the public, offering a reward of up to $20,000, but warn that Christy should be considered armed and dangerous.","donald j trump christy

In a post-Labor Day briefing at the White House, a top Republican pollster told senior staff that the determining factor in the election wouldn't be the improving economy or the steady increase in job creation. It would be how voters feel about Trump.

And the majority of the electorate, including a sizable percentage of Republican-leaning voters, doesn't feel good about the president, according to a presentation from pollster Neil Newhouse that spanned dozens of pages.

Newhouse's briefing came amid a darkening mood among Republican officials as the November election nears. Party leaders were already worried that a surge in enthusiasm among Democrats and disdain for Trump by moderate Republicans would put the House out of reach. But some Republicans now fear their Senate majority is also in peril -- a scenario that was unthinkable a few months ago given the favorable Senate map for the GOP.

""For Republican candidates to win in swing states, they need all of the voters who support President Trump, plus a chunk of those who do not,"" said Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster. ""That is threading a very narrow strategic needle.""

Operatives in both parties say Republicans still have the edge in the fight for control of the Senate. But GOP officials are increasingly worried that nominees in conservative-leaning states like Missouri and Indiana are underperforming, while races in Tennessee and Texas that should be slam-dunks for Republicans are close.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell raised an alarm last week, warning that each of the competitive Senate races would be ""like a knife fight in an alley.""

Some of the public fretting among Republicans appears to be strategic, as party officials try to motivate both voters and donors. Many moderate Republican voters ""don't believe there is anything at stake in this election,"" according to the documents Newhouse presented to White House officials. He attributed that belief in part to a disregard for public polling, given that most surveys showed Democrat Hillary Clinton defeating Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

Newhouse and the White House would not comment on the early September meeting. The Associated Press obtained a copy of Newhouse's presentation, and two Republicans with knowledge of the briefing discussed the details on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the matter publicly.","conservativeleaning

""I still very much believe in the company and the people who work there,"" Laplanche told CNBC.

For his second act in financial services, Laplanche is focused avoiding past mistakes. He was forced to resign suddenly from LendingClub in May 2016 for a convoluted set of events involving the questionable sale of certain loans by the company and a lack of transparency with the board.

LendingClub has struggled to recover. Since debuting on the New York Stock Exchange at $15 in late 2014, the shares have lost more than three-quarters of their value to $3.38 at Friday's close.

Laplanche started his new company, Upgrade, in August 2016, three months after leaving LendingClub. His start-up passed $100 million in monthly loan originations in April. By way of comparison, LendingClub, founded in 2016, averaged almost $1 billion in monthly originations in the second quarter.

Laplanche sees plenty of room for both companies to succeed given that low unemployment and loosening regulations have spurred growth in consumer lending. At the end of the second quarter, there were $120 billion worth of outstanding personal loans in the U.S., according to TransUnion,

But philanthropic experts say the announcement — while a good start — still has many unanswered questions that need to be addressed as the world's richest person accelerates his plan to give back.

But he didn't fit in.

There were the ""super spiritual woo-woo"" groups, which he described as ""code word for 'you walk around with guys in white robes and smudge sticks.'"" There were the antiquated men's movements from the '90s, which rallied around the concept that men were warriors. There were business-focused groups where it would be awkward to talk about personal issues. He bounced around 12-step programs for two months, then realized he could never appreciate the camaraderie of these meetings because he wasn't an addict.

When Lewis told Krump about Open Source, he decided to give it a try.

Krump was more enthusiastic than most. Many men who have gone to a modern masculinity meeting admit they were frightened, and don't know what to expect. A promotional video for Evryman has one guy admitting he thought ""this is going to be f------ awful."" Yet, something still compels them to go.

The Berkshire retreat and other modern masculinity retreats operate in expanded versions of the weekly meetings. There's usually an outdoor activity. Organizers strive to make the food excellent, and the workouts intense. A recent backcountry Evryman adventure included a 50-mile hike into Yellowstone to look at the stars. At the Junto retreats, 15 men stay in the same house and sleep on angled beds in communal rooms.

Next comes the real work. At Evryman retreats, just like in the weekly meetings, the men sit in a circle and start with a thematic meditation where they get connected to what they feel, Doty explained. Then, there is a check-in round where people share the main emotion they are feeling that week. The second round starts with a prompt, like a question about romantic relationships, their relationship with their fathers, or a request to discuss something they're ashamed of.

""It's like Crossfit for your insides,"" Krump said.

People have about 10 minutes or so to hold the floor, while others give feedback. Men will get angry. They'll scream and get upset. Krump cried during a group a couple weeks ago.

""It's not always beautiful,"" Doty said. ""The process of sinking deeper and deeper and sharing more and more, that directly helps with emotional suppression. The connection between men by taking that risk to become more vulnerable helps you gain lifelong friendships.""

After the Berkshire retreat, Krump decided to use his experience building companies and dedicate it to growing Evryman. Yahoo, his employer at the time, was about to be acquired by Verizon, and he knew he was going to be let go in a few months. So, he decided to dedicate his severance — one year worth of salary — to expanding the Evryman movement. He dove into the project while the deal was closing.

In April 2017, Doty appeared on the ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast (of recent Elon Musk pot smoking fame) to talk about the modern masculinity movement. Evryman hired a NYU student it found on Craiglsist to quickly build a website, and Krump edited the text until Doty went on air. Within the next 24 hours, Evryman received 3,000 emails.

""There were a lot of tears,"" Krump recalled. ""Some of them were great. Some of them were positive and encouraging. Some of them were just a lot of guys that needed to talk in this way.""","businessfocused

In 1983, the 37-year-old real estate developer spent less than $10 million to buy the New Jersey Generals, a messy team coming off its first season in the rollicking spring league.

From the time Trump started running the Generals, those involved with the USFL saw a man fixated on another goal: Owning a team in the National Football League, the pinnacle of the American sport.

""I don't know about the rest of you people and I don't know how much money you guys have, but I have the money to get into the NFL,"" Trump told his fellow USFL owners at a meeting in 1984, according to a new book about the league. ""And that's where I plan on being.""

Trump, who now sits in the White House after a dizzying political rise, never got his wish. His repeated failure to break into the NFL contributed to an animosity toward the league that has lingered for decades. That conclusion is based on the reporting of Jeff Pearlman, a sports journalist and author of ""Football for a Buck: The Crazy Rise and Crazier Demise of the USFL."" The book was published Tuesday, the same day as another Trump-flavored tell-all, Bob Woodward's ""Fear: Trump in the White House.""

In the Oval Office, Trump has repeatedly targeted the NFL in one of his favorite political fights, over whether players should kneel during the national anthem while protesting social justice issues. He is expected to return to the issue repeatedly during football season as the midterm elections approach, as it plays to both the patriotism and reverence for the U.S. military that stoke excitement in his political base.

As the first Sunday of the NFL regular season kicked off last weekend, the president took another swipe at the NFL and cheered a drop in television ratings for its first Thursday night game. He tweeted: ""If the players stood proudly for our Flag and Anthem, and it is all shown on broadcast, maybe ratings could come back? Otherwise worse!""

Pearlman said Trump's battle with the NFL certainly relates to his inability to become part of the league.

""It all, to me, really comes back to the rejection he kept getting from the NFL,"" the author told CNBC. ""He's never handled that stuff well. But it's repeated and repeated slights and repeated rejections, and it all kind of adds up to what we're seeing now.""","national football league

Winds have dropped to about 40 miles per hour (65 kph) since it roared ashore along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane and it is crawling west over two states at 6 mph (9 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said early Sunday.

Taylor said the storm already dumped 30 inches of rain on some parts of the N.C.

""This storm is still deadly and dangerous and it's expected to turn northward later today into Virginia and the mid-Atlantic,"" he said.

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said: ""This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall, in some places measured in feet and not inches."" Rivers will continue to rise days after the rain has stopped, he said.

Around 50 stranded people were airlifted by helicopter in North Carolina, said Petty Officer Michael Himes of the U.S. Coast Guard. More than 26,000 hunkered down in shelters.","national weather centers weather prediction center in college park maryland

The official effectively confirmed a Saturday report by The Wall Street Journal, which dovetailed with similar reporting on Friday from Bloomberg saying the president directed his aides to proceed with plans to hit China's imports again. While both sides are preparing to meet in order to dial back on trade tensions, Trump's latest actions may imperil those discussions, and may bring fresh retaliation from Beijing, The WSJ reported on Sunday.

The new tariffs will be set at 10 percent, sources familiar with the matter told The Journal, below an original figure of 25 percent floated by the administration earlier. The president is also expected to threaten to hike tariffs again to squeeze Beijing at the negotiating table, but the Chinese have shown no public signs of bending.

The lower figure has a dual purpose: Diminishing the impact on U.S. consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season, while helping Republicans on the campaign trail ahead of the midterm elections. While voters give Trump high praise on the economy, numerous polls show the Democrats with a wide advantage, and show a public restive about the president's trade wars.

In the last several weeks, Trump has repeatedly signaled he could pull the trigger on new tariffs — which could impact a wide range of consumer goods — whenever he deemed the timing appropriate.

This week, the president met with trade advisors, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, according to reports.

Mnuchin had been spearheading attempts to restart trade talks with China, which The Journal on Sunday reported were in doubt, as the Chinese threatened to decline participation, balking at Trump's demands. Beijing may also restrict sales of goods into the U.S., the report said.

Trump, meanwhile, has indicated he has no intention of backing down. On Thursday he tweeted ""we are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us.""

In a statement provided to CNBC on Friday, the White House said, ""The President has been clear that he and his administration will continue to take action to address China's unfair trade practices. We encourage China to address the long standing concerns raised by the United States.""

To take a Senate majority, the party has to net two seats in November.

While flipping the Senate appears daunting for Democrats, the party does have a path to do so. It would require winning eight of the 10 battleground races considered most competitive. For example, if only one incumbent Democrat loses, the party would have to defend all its other seats and flip three GOP-held seats to take a majority.

If Republicans knock out two Democratic senators, it all but assures them they will keep their majority, unless Democrats can pull off a nearly clean sweep of accessible Republican seats.

Earlier this week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell described the 10 races listed above — excluding Texas — ""too close to call and every one of them like a knife fight in an alley, just a brawl."" He separately called the Texas race between Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democrat Beto O'Rourke ""competitive.""

To put a figure on it, models made by widely followed data guru Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight give Democrats about a 1-in-3 chance of taking the Senate. The average projected outcome leaves the Senate right about where it started, with the GOP holding a 51-49 majority.

In assessing the potential outcomes, Silver writes that ""just as Republicans are far from doomed in the House, they are far from safe in the Senate."" Still, the site's models see a Democratic House and a Republican Senate as the most likely scenario after November's elections.

A number of factors, including Trump's approval rating, the congressional generic ballot and the money that flows into each of the contests, could change the likelihood of the Senate flipping between now and November. In addition, a handful of races for seats not outlined here could become more competitive.","mitch mcconnell

That talk was partly behind Friday's global bond market sell-off that hit Treasury prices and swept yields higher. The

U.S. 10-year yield briefly rose to the key 3 percent mark. Ironically, the rout comes on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the failure of Lehman Brothers, a catastrophic event for financial markets that forced the Fed and other central banks into extreme easing policies they are just beginning to unwind.

Investors have been doubting the Fed will follow through with the two rate hikes it forecasts for this year and three for next year. The futures market had been anticipating a September rate hike, but this week, fed funds futures began to reflect an 80 percent chance of a hike in December, a sharp jump from last week's expectations of about 60 percent. For next year, the futures now reflect nearly two rate hikes while previously one was barely priced in.

The benchmark 10-year yield is a widely watched metric since it is linked to many business and consumer loans, including home mortgages. Yields rise inversely to bond prices.

Strategists pointed to multiple reasons behind Friday's global surge in yields. But all agreed, the selling was linked in part to the tone from the European Central Bank meeting Thursday, at which ECB President Mario Draghi once more signaled an end to the bank's bond buying program.

""I think it's the central banks for years have been big tailwinds for the markets. They've been super helpful for equities and they're becoming a little bit of a headwind,"" said Michael Schumacher, director rates strategy at Wells Fargo. ""The Fed is getting company from the ECB and maybe the Bank of England. ... Central banks are switching from being super-stimulative to stimulative.""

Nomura's George Goncalves said expectations are being driven by tough talk by the Fed, and it could sound hawkish again when it meets to raise interest rates on Sept. 26. Even officials, like Fed Gov. Lael Brainard, viewed as a dove, said Thursday that the Fed could raise rates for some time without slowing the economy.

""All the doves at the Fed sound a little more on the hawkish side,"" he said. ""What's impressive is it happened even though we had weaker data,"" said Goncalves, head of U.S. rate strategy. ""It's the second day after Draghi's statement, and everyone thinks central banks are going to be dovish forever. Although he didn't really say anything new, what was strikingly hawkish is they're clearly going to exit away from ultra-accommodation, and their bond markets are the most aggreggiously mispriced in the last couple of years.""

Stronger U.S. inflation, though not apparent in this week's consumer price index report, and better growth is supporting higher rates in the U.S., which strategists say have been too low. The 10-year yield's move above 3 percent was for the first time since August, and the 30-year rose to 3.13 percent. In Europe, Germany's 10-year bund rose to 0.44 percent and the French sovereign reached 0.77 percent.

The 10-year yield pushed above 3 percent in April, May (when it reached a recent high of 3.128 percent), June and August, but it has failed to hold the level for long.

""I think what we have to recognize is if we strictly looked at the fundamentals of the market, we should be between 3 and 3.25 percent. I don't think we should be above 3.25 percent. It doesn't mean we should be at 4 percent,"" said Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. ""But every time we've gotten here, some kind of news came out, whether it's trade related or an [emerging markets] event that pushed rates lower. Interest rates, left to their own devices, would push higher.""

Caron expects the Fed to raise rates another percentage point, or four times, before pausing. ""What we've seen for the first time this summer is a two week period where things have actually gotten better,"" he said. He said some of the concerns with Italian debt have faded as politicians there appear more willing to work within European Union rules.

""The other thing is that Argentina, they've been doing all the right things, going to the IMF, hiking interest rates,"" he said, adding that Turkey has also moved to raise interest rates. Reports that China and the U.S. will talk on trade is also a catalyst, and there are positive signs that the U.S. and Canada are trying to work out their differences on trade. Bloomberg headlines at noon Friday that President Donald Trump wants to move ahead with tariffs on China did take some of the steam out of higher yields, but did not reverse the sell-off.

""It's a global phenomena. They're all moving on the Fed and now the ECB is saying similar things,"" said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance. ""This is not running on data. It's running on technicals. The Fed's moving. The Fed's not stopping. Supply is coming. We're funding the tax plan with deficit spending.""

The big move in yields follows three auctions this week for 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. It also comes as corporate issuance surges, with nearly $90 billion in new debt in just the past two weeks, according to Informa Global Markets.

Brenner said the next level he's watching on the 10-year yield is 3.128 percent, the year high, and he's watching 3.25 percent on the 30-year. ""If those two things break, it's lights out to the next level,"" he said.

He said one factor that may be contributing to rate rise is the fact that pension fund buying in bonds could be slowing for now, after a surge in buying ahead of a mid-September tax deadline. Under the new tax law, corporate pension sponsors had until Sept. 15 to deduct contributions at last year's rate instead of the new 21 percent rate. Strategist said that did not drive rates higher, as much as it may have removed a supportive buyer from the market.

Goncalves said a bigger factor is the fact that central banks are increasingly removing stimulus though the ECB did not reveal anything new. ""I think markets are realizing they're unwavering. They're slipping into tightening, and that's putting pressure on European rates. That's going to put upward pressure on ours. You couple that with the idea that deficits are going to start to matter in the U.S., it's a perfect debt supply cocktail that's going to push U.S. rates higher,"" he said.

Goncalves said he ultimately expects a 3.5 percent 10-year yield, but in 2019. At that point, yields could challenge the stock market, as investors may see more yield in bonds.

Schumacher said the move higher in yields Friday was unusual since typically after 30-year bond auctions, yields move lower. The auction was Thursday.

""As an investor or hedger or whatever, you have to pay a lot more attention to the Fed and say maybe they're going to do this. ... I think it's partly the sense that inflation is picking up a little bit,"" said Schumacher. He said the market took the near 3 percent surprise annual jump in average wages, reported in last week's August payrolls data, far more seriously than CPI, which was weaker than expected this week. ""The wages thing shocked people.""","informa global markets brenner

CNN ""State of the Union"" anchor Jake Tapper asked where that estimated $40 trillion -- which would include the costs for Medicare for all, jobs guarantees, student loan forgiveness, free college programs, paid family leave, and Social Security expansion -- would come from. Medicare for all would be the costliest initiative, coming in at about $32 trillion, according to the Mercatus Center, a free market-oriented think tank at George Mason University , as well as an earlier study by the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center

Ocasio-Cortez, who is running for a congressional seat in New York, referred to the publicly funded health care systems in Western Europe and Canada, calling such programs ""generational investments"" toward the future of a country.

""Medicare for all would save the American people a very large amount of money,"" she said. ""What we see as well is that these systems are not just pie in the sky. Many of them are accomplished by every modern, civilized democracy in the Western world,"" she said. ""The United Kingdom has a form of single-payer health care -- Canada, France, Germany. What we need to realize that these investments are better and they are good for our future.""

But asked again where that $40 trillion would come from, aside from her proposed increase in taxes on the wealthy and corporate taxes, which she has said would raise $2 trillion over the next 10 years, Ocasio-Cortez said the taxpayer-funded programs would free people up to increase economic activity in other areas, adding that the Medicare for all program is part of ""a broader agenda.""

The NFL Foundation is helping out with relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Florence touching down along the east coast over the weekend.

Per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the foundation will contribute $1 million to various organizations that are going to address immediate needs of areas impacted by the storm.

Florence touched down in North Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane Friday before being downgraded to a tropical depression as it continued to move inland.

However, the storm has still caused massive damage in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.

""The flood danger from this storm is more immediate today than when it ... made landfall 24 hours ago,"" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said Saturday, via CNN. ""We face walls of water at our coasts, along our rivers, across our farmland, in our cities and in our towns.""

Parts of North Carolina and South Carolina could see up to 40 inches of rain before Florence ends. The National Hurricane Center said parts of the Carolinas, Virginia and West Virginia will likely experience ""catastrophic flash floods and prolonged significant river flooding"" through the beginning of this week.

Per the Washington Post, officials have said at least 11 people have been killed as a result of the storm.","the

Lumberton, North Carolina (CNN) Florence's catastrophic encore could bring some of its worst destruction yet on Sunday.

""We're going to get hammered,"" said Kevin Arata, spokesman for the city of Fayetteville, North Carolina. ""The worst is still yet to come.""

Never mind that Florence weakened to a tropical depression Sunday morning. That just means the wind speeds calmed down slightly. The real dangers are Florence's relentless rainfall and historic flooding, which keep getting worse.

Florence has already killed 14 people in two states. Volunteer rescue groups such as the Cajun Army and emergency workers are scrambling to save hundreds of people still trapped by rising floodwater.

""We actually just rescued over 200 people, and we've got about another 300 to 500"" left to rescue, Cajun Army President Todd Terrell said Sunday. ""The water is coming up really fast.""

And in Lumberton, North Carolina -- a city submerged by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 -- residents are bracing for potential disaster as the Lumber River threatens to burst through a recently patched-up gap in the levee system

Latest developments

• Storm victims report price gouging: The North Carolina attorney general's office has received more than 500 complaints of price gouging -- including for hotel rooms, gas and water. Authorities have already launched investigations.

• Widespread power outages: About 703,000 customers in North Carolina and 61,000 in South Carolina don't have power. But the number of actual people without power is far greater, since a single customer can represent an entire family.

• Florence is lingering in the Southeast: As of Sunday morning, Florence was centered about 20 miles southwest of Columbia, South Carolina, the National Hurricane Center said. It was moving west at 8 mph, whipping 35 mph winds.

• Much more flooding to come: Florence is expected to leave a total of 40 inches of rain in North Carolina and the northeastern tip of South Carolina, the hurricane center said. Some other parts of South Carolina will be left with 15 inches of rain.

• Watch out for landslides, too: ""In addition to the flash flood and flooding threat, landslides are possible in the higher terrain of the southern and central Appalachians across western North Carolina into southwest Virginia,"" the hurricane center said.

'Let's get in the truck and get out of here'

Residents in Lumberton watched nervously as the Lumber River swelled almost 12 feet deeper than flood stage. The city was submerged for days after 2016's Hurricane Matthew.

Volunteers and city workers worked feverishly to fill sandbags , trying to plug a low point in the levee system before the river crests.

Bobby Hunt's house is still damaged from Matthew. As the river kept rising Sunday, he knew it was time to flee.

Coast Guard members help a stranded motorist Sunday in Lumberton, North Carolina.

""Let's get in the truck and get out of here,"" Hunt said as his family quickly left their boarded-up home.

Hunt said Matthew caught them by surprise with flooding in the middle of the night. He's not waiting for that to happen again.

The Lumber River is rising faster than expected, officials said. By Sunday afternoon, it had reached nearly 25 feet -- 12 feet beyond flood stage.

And once the river reaches 26 feet, authorities predicted, the barriers will be overwhelmed.

The fear of sudden, massive river flooding isn't limited to Lumberton.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said many rivers across the state still haven't crested. Some of the bloated rivers won't crest until late Sunday or Monday.

Cooper said it's not too late to go to an emergency shelter. More than 15,000 people are staying at 150 emergency shelters. And if those shelters fill up, he said, the state will open up more.

Wilmington is basically cut off

The coastal North Carolina city of Wilmington, population 117,000, is so deeply submerged that no one can get in.

Part of downtown Wilmington, North Carolina, is inundated by water from the swollen Cape Fear River.

""Any direction you try coming into the city, from 20 to 40 miles out, roads are impassable,"" Mayor Bill Saffo said. ""Anyone trying to get in here -- don't try, you will be turned away. Highway Patrol won't let you.""

That means fuel and other critical supplies can't get in, either.

The Wilmington-based Cape Fear Public Utility Authority urged residents to fill bathtubs and containers with water in case the utility doesn't have enough fuel to keep its water treatment plants running.

Causes of death include electrocution and fallen trees

The death toll from Florence rose Sunday, with authorities saying 14 deaths have been linked to the storm:

-- A man who drowned in an overturned vehicle on a flooded road in Georgetown County, South Carolina.

-- Three people who died in flash flooding or swift water on roads in Duplin County, North Carolina

-- Two people who died in a storm-related fire in Cumberland County, North Carolina

-- A mother and a child who were killed when a tree fell on their house in Wilmington, North Carolina

-- Two people who died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Horry County, South Carolina.

-- A woman in South Carolina who struck a downed tree while she was driving.

-- A woman who suffered cardiac arrest in Hampstead, North Carolina. When emergency responders tried to reach her, their path was blocked by fallen trees.

-- A man who was killed while checking on his dogs in Lenoir County, North Carolina.

-- Another man in Lenoir County who was electrocuted while trying to connect two extension cords.

As much of North Carolina faces flooding for days, Gov. Cooper said the risk of more deaths is quite real.

""Remember: Most storm deaths occur from drowning in fresh water, often in cars,"" he said. ""Don't drive across standing or moving water.""","lumberton north carolina cnn florences

In New Bern, North Carolina, one of the cities hardest-hit by the storm that made landfall Friday as a Category 1 hurricane, a beloved bear statue and its thick pedestal were uprooted and washed away.

""Some of our beloved bears have wandered away,"" city officials tweeted next to a picture of the statue. ""These statues, which New Bern is known for, are extremely heavy & bolted down at sponsoring businesses. This one ended up in the middle of S. Front St!""

The bear is surrounded by water, but its colonial-era coat, breeches and buckled shoes remain intact.

There's no one effort that prompted the drop. Shifts to renewable energy and more efficient electricity use helped, but so did more efficient transportation (including shared transport and more walking), more recycling and reduced methane from landfills. Think of it as a combination of small initiatives that amounted to a lot.

You might not want to cheer too loudly. The declines were generally from known progressive cities in North America, Europe, Scandinavia and Australia. It would mean more if emissions declined in places where CO2 output is rampant and frequently dovetails with air pollution problems like smog. And of course, this only covers individual cities, not whole countries. Even a few major cities might not completely offset emissions across a larger country. Still, it's progress -- and it suggests that the Paris agreement's 2020 peak emissions target was somewhat realistic.","north america europe scandinavia

Like with YouTube's July censorship sweep, the women create videos of sound effects and have been expelled from the payment utility under alleged violations of the company's sexual content policy prohibitions. ASMR community websites are now warning all creators to avoid PayPal. Engadget reached out to PayPal regarding the banning of ASMR video creators, the 8chan sex-harassment campaign and how PayPal plans to protect users from this type of abuse -- but we did not hear back before publication time.

Update: PayPal responded with the following statement:

""Customer service and the positive resolution of buyer and seller issues are an important focus for PayPal. Our customer service team is always available to help customers understand our policies to ensure compliance. Additionally, PayPal has no policy against autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) related content that does not otherwise violate PayPal Acceptable Use policy.""

Woken up to an email from PayPal claiming I can no longer use PayPal AT ALL. FOREVER. My funds are blocked for 180 days, and I can't create a new account. Please do not send me any donations, or payments to my PayPal. I have no idea why this has happened 😫 — CC (@ccalmasmr) September 7, 2018

Capitalizing on entrenched and easily exploitable anti-sex policies by internet giant payment processors and a new internet sex panic ushered in by FOSTA, 8chan trolls have started a campaign to mass-report attractive women who make ASMR videos. Listing names of women making these sound-effect videos in a forum thread called ""PayPal lowering the hammer on ASMRtits"" they've declared war by posting links to report pages for PayPal, and called upon fellow haters to get the women kicked off YouTube and Patreon as well. They're laughing at the women's anguish over creating nonsexual content and losing their revenue streams, saying things like ""another whore for the deep-freeze"" — in between posting anti-Semitic and Pepe the frog images, of course.

If you're unfamiliar with ASMR, it's essentially a genre of videos where the creator makes sound effects in a variety of scenarios that are geared toward evoking a sense-memory of tingling sensations from the back of the head. If anyone ever played with your hair and you felt a funny but calming shiver, you get the idea. The performance artists in these videos do things to create sounds like playing with hair, brushing microphones with makeup brushes, chewing ice and lots of other things that evoke a feeling for viewers. Not everyone tunes into the sensations, but those who do find it very beneficial.

It may sound weird, but it's quite popular — especially with people combating anxiety and insomnia. University research has found that these sound effects and their resultant physical trigger, ASMR (""autonomous sensory meridian response""), actually work. In June this year, the University of Sheffield's department of psychology found that people who ""use"" ASMR showed significant reductions in heart rates, as well as lowering of stress and anxiety, and feelings of social connectivity.

""The study found that those who experience ASMR showed significantly greater reductions in their heart rates when watching ASMR videos (an average decrease of 3.14 beats per minute) compared to those who do not,"" wrote the researchers. ""They also showed significant increases in positive emotions including relaxation and feelings of social connection.""

What's more, in 2015, researchers at Swansea University in Wales found that 85% of people who watch (listen to) ASMR videos use them to reliably fall asleep. ""There is a suggestion that ASMR may be of use for providing temporary relief to individuals with depression, stress and chronic pain,"" the study abstract explained.

It's particularly important (for our purposes here) to note that the research found ""82% agreed that they used ASMR to help them sleep, and 70% used ASMR to deal with stress. A small number of individuals (5%) reported using ASMR media for sexual stimulation, with the vast majority of participants (84%) disagreeing with this notion.""

For those curious, ""The sample of the present study was comprised of 245 men, 222 women and 8 individuals of non-binary gender (N = 475).""","university of sheffields department of psychology

Collectively, though, they make the wearable category, which has been struggling to prove its usefulness for years, feel relevant and promising again.

While we always knew about the potential for wearables to be excellent fitness companions, the latest announcements show us that companies are taking your overall health a lot more seriously. The smartwatches of 2018 and beyond will be more than glorified pedometers -- they'll actually offer useful information like whether you're matching up to recommended activity standards.

Apple's and Google's collaborations with the AHA led to better interpretation of the heart rate data that the Apple Watch and Wear OS devices are constantly collecting. This way, they can be appealing to not only runners or exercise enthusiasts but also a wider audience that is more interested in their general health.

It's interesting, too, that the Apple Watch Series 4 managed to get FDA clearance for its ECG and irregular rhythm notification -- but I'd caution against relying on those features too heavily. First of all, the FDA decision classifies these two specific functions of the Watch as over-the-counter tools that should not be used in place of ""traditional methods of diagnosis or treatment."" Plus, I'm not sure most people can make sense of an ECG. I had to ask a cousin who works as an ER doctor to see if anything was amiss with my own chart when I had a checkup years ago.

These devices are ultimately about detecting anomalies -- events that deviate from your typical pattern. On the new Apple Watch, this means things like irregular heart rhythm (a possible sign of atrial fibrillation) or falls. In the case of the latter, if you fall and can't get up, the Watch can also send for help.

Beyond general health tracking, this data will be useful for your doctor (should you choose to share your stats with your health care provider). Our memories are unreliable, which is why a regular record of our heart rate is much more helpful in catching potential problems early.

There's also value in using your cardio data to measure your daily activity -- and not just to tell you about your sleep stages and exercise zones like Fitbits and other trackers do. Though it's not the only indicator of your overall well-being, your heart health is the easiest for smartwatches to track. Google is using this data in the new Fit to encourage people to lead more-active lives by attaining a recommended number of ""Heart points"" each week. This way, smartwatches not only are on the lookout for potentially worrying symptoms but also are becoming better at preventative care. In other words, the next generation of wearables can be both watchful guardian and naggy parent.","announcements

The 2070 and 2080 have 8GB of GDDR6 RAM; the 2080 Ti has 11GB. All three are based on the company's new Turing architecture, which means they have cores dedicated to AI (Tensor) and ray-tracing (RT).

All have higher clock speeds for a 5 to 6 percent improvement in TFLOPS.

Expect a fourth card, likely the RTX 2060, to bring the entry price down significantly in the coming months, followed by a slew of cut-down options for budget-minded gamers (the 10 series made its way down to the sub-$100 GTX 1030). There's also room at the top end for expansion: The RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition can handle 14.2 trillion floating-point operations per second (TFLOPS), while the Turing TU102 chip these new cards are based on pushes that figure up to 16.3 TFLOPS. That's achieved through a mix of higher clock speeds and more CUDA cores (the 2080 Ti has 4,352, the fully configured TU102 has 4,608.)

RTX also arrives with a lot of under-the-hood improvements. There's a faster caching system with a shared memory architecture, a new graphics pipeline and concurrent processing of floating and integer calculations. If that means nothing to you, don't worry too much: The takeaway from that word soup is not only does the RTX range have more raw power, but it uses that power more efficiently.

And that's the key here. Ray-tracing stole the headlines, and I'm intrigued to see how developers use it, but it's efficiency that really excites me about RTX.

The ultimate goal of a game system, be it a $2,000 gaming PC or a $300 Nintendo Switch, is to calculate a color value for each pixel on a screen. Even a simplified guide on how a modern graphics pipeline does this would run the length of a novella, but here's a three-sentence summary: CPUs aren't made to render modern graphics. Instead, a CPU sends a plan for what it wants to draw to a GPU, which has hundreds or thousands of cores that can work independently on small chunks of an image. The GPU executes on the CPU's plan, running shaders -- very small programs -- to define the color of each pixel.

The challenge for both graphics-card manufacturers and game developers, then, is scale. That $300 Switch, in portable mode, typically calculates 27-million pixel values a second, which it can do just fine with a three-year-old mobile NVIDIA chip. If you're targeting 4K at 60FPS (which is what many gamers buying RTX cards want) your system needs to push out close to half-a-billion pixels a second. That puts a huge strain on a system, especially when you consider that your PC isn't just picking these colors out of thin air, and is instead simulating a complex 3D environment in real time as part of the calculations.

There are already plenty of techniques used to reduce that strain. One is rendering all or parts of a scene at a lower resolution and stretching the results out. This is super obvious when you have a game running at 720p on a 1080p screen, but less so when, say, a fog cloud is being drawn at quarter-resolution. And that's what NVIDIA's optimizations are all about: cutting down the quality in places you won't notice.

NVIDIA's new graphics pipeline can employ several new shading techniques to cut corners. In many ways, this builds on less-flexible power-saving measures utilized for VR, like MRS (multi-resolution shading) and LMS (lens-matched shading). In the image above, you're seeing a GPU breaking a scene down into a grid in real time. The uncolored squares are high-detail, and shaded at a 1:1 ratio, just like a regular game scene. The colored ones don't need the same level of attention. The red squares, for example, are only shaded in 4x4 pixel blocks, while more-detailed but non-essential blue squares are shaded in 2x2 blocks. Given the low detail level of those areas of the image, the change is essentially unnoticeable.","the

The latest installment in Fox’s action-packed film series about extraterrestrial big-game hunters is on track to debut with an estimated $24 million in ticket sales from Friday through Sunday, at 4,037 theaters in the U.S. and Canada. In doing so, it will dethrone last week’s No. 1 movie, The Nun, and keep fellow new releases A Simple Favor, White Boy Rick, and Unbroken: Path to Redemption at bay.

Although it’s poised to top the box office, The Predator is coming in on the low end of industry forecasts, which ranged from $25 million to $35 million. The film, which cost $88 million to produce, is also trailing its most recent predecessor, Predators, which opened with $24.8 million eight years ago. Overseas, The Predator will add about $30.7 million this weekend.

Marking the sixth film in the Predator franchise (counting two Aliens vs. Predator crossovers) and arriving 31 years after the Arnold Schwarzenegger-led original, The Predator finds the titular alien stalking humans in suburbia, including an Army Ranger played by Boyd Holbrook, a scientist played by Olivia Munn, and a young boy played by Jacob Tremblay. Shane Black (who played a supporting role in 1987’s Predator) directed, from a script he wrote with Frank Dekker.

Critics’ reviews were underwhelming, while audiences gave it a weak C+ CinemaScore, which does not bode well for word of mouth.

Warner Bros. and New Line’s horror flick The Nun will earn about $18 million in its sophomore weekend, good for second place. That brings the film’s domestic total to about $85 million after 10 days in theaters. Internationally, the film has grossed an estimated $143.6 million, for a global total of $228.7 million.

Arriving alongside The Predator this weekend are Lionsgate’s thriller A Simple Favor, in third place with an estimated $16.1 million; Sony’s crime drama White Boy Rick, in fourth place with an estimated $8.8 million; and PureFlix’s biopic Unbroken: Path to Redemption, in ninth place with an estimated $2.4 million.

Peter Iovino/Lionsgate

A Simple Favor is directed by Paul Feig (Bridesmaids) and stars Anna Kendrick as a mommy blogger who tries to solve the disappearance of a glamourous new friend (played by Blake Lively). The film is coming in slightly ahead of industry projections, which were in the $12 million to $15 million range.

White Boy Rick is based on the true story of Richard Wershe Jr., a young drug kingpin and FBI informant in 1980s Detroit. The film stars Richie Merritt, Matthew McConaughey, and Bel Powley; Yann Demange directed. Its opening is in line with projections.

Finally, Path to Redemption is a sequel to Angelina Jolie’s 2014 film Unbroken, about Olympic runner and World War II veteran Louis Zamperini. Directed by Harold Cronk (God’s Not Dead), the new film chronicles Zamperini’s return from the war, his struggles to readjust to civilian life, and his religious reawakening.

According to ComScore, overall box office is up 8.9 percent year-to-date. Check out the Sept. 14-16 figures below.

1. The Predator — $24 million

2. The Nun — $18 million

3. A Simple Favor — $16.1 million

4. White Boy Rick — $8.8 million

5. Crazy Rich Asians — $8.7 million

6. Peppermint — $6.1 million

7. The Meg — $3.8 million

8. Searching — $3.2 million

Richard Gere is expecting his second child and first with new wife Alejandra Silva, who announced the news with some help from the Dalai Lama.

“A very special moment just a few minutes ago… Getting blessings for our precious to come,” penned Silva of an Instagram photo showing the Buddhist leader blessing her baby bump.

“We couldn’t announce it before telling HH Dalai Lama☺️,” added the 35-year-old Spanish businesswoman and activist, who went on to share the message in her first language.

Gere, 69, also shares 18-year-old son Homer James Jigme with ex-wife Carey Lowell. The couple’s bundle of joy on the way is also the second child for Silva, who has a 5½-year-old son named Albert from a previous marriage.

Gere and Silva had known each other for over a decade before they first began dating in 2014. In April, a source close to the couple told PEOPLE they married “weeks and weeks ago” and are “extraordinarily happy.”

“They’re so comfortable with each other, have fun together and are looking forward to their future together,” the insider revealed of Gere and Silva.

According to Spanish outlet HOLA!, who were the first to report the marriage news, the two wed in early April in a civil ceremony and planned to celebrate the nuptials at a party in New York City in early May with family and friends.

The resulting fête — held at Gere’s estate in Pound Ridge, New York — included several Tibetan monks (Gere is a Buddhist and one of son Homer’s middle names, Jigme, is a Tibetan name).

After news of their marriage broke, a film source who has known Gere for years told PEOPLE he “has been much happier in this half of his life because he is settled, confident and doing what he likes.”

“Practicing Buddhism and doing humanitarian work have fulfilled and transformed him, and he is at a stage when he can make the kinds of films that he likes,” the insider added of the Chicago star.

This is Gere’s third marriage. He first tied the knot with supermodel Cindy Crawford, to whom he was married from 1991 to 1995. The actor later welcomed his only son with second wife Lowell, whom he wed in 2002 before a contentious divorce that was finalized in 2016 after they separated in 2013.","middle names jigme

Big news: Eddie (Vanessa Ray) and Jamie (Will Estes) have finally confessed their love for each other after years of squad-car bickering and flirting. In the season 8 finale, the two announced at a Reagan family dinner their plans to marry. The scene was shocking, then heartwarming — and also left viewers wondering, What is going to happen next?

Indeed, that was on executive producer Kevin Wade’s mind when he mapped out the new season. “This idea that they’d be engaged to be married, and yet still riding together as cop partners — we had to address that right at the top,” Wade says. Adds Ray: “Like anybody in a relationship, you think, ‘Nothing’s going to change, right?’ They’ve been together all these years, they know each other inside and out…. But what they’re constantly coming up against is ‘Man, it has changed.’”

But here’s the bigger news: Eddie’s coming to dinner with a seat at the table between Jamie and her almost sister-in-law, Erin (Bridget Moynahan). Wade doesn’t mince words about the impact on one of Blue Bloods’ most sacred traditions. “It’s an injection of nitrous oxide into that dinner table,” he teases with glee. “It throws off the balance — in a good way.” Ray, meanwhile, is excited about bringing some comic relief to the proceedings. “[Eddie] is very unaware of the fact that she’s comical,” says the actress. “She’s so earnest!” (Expect her to rave about the peas.)

Back in the spring, Ray was nervous about the shake-up, but as she settles into the series’ new dynamic, she’s become thrilled by it. “It feels like I’m on a new show,” she gushes. “Before, it was like, Will and I against the world. Now it’s this huge collaborative effort.”

Blue Bloods returns for season 9 on Friday, Sept. 28, at 10 p.m. ET on CBS. Check out an exclusive first-look photo above.","erin bridget moynahan wade

The “Cry Pretty” singer — who shares son Isaiah, 3, with hockey player husband Mike Fisher, 38, and has a baby on the way — opened up about her challenging fertility struggles in an interview on CBS Sunday Morning, saying she experienced the first miscarriage last year.

“I’d kind of planned that 2017 was, you know, going to be the year that I work on new music, and I have a baby,” said Underwood, 35. “We got pregnant early 2017, and didn’t work out.”

At the time, Underwood leaned into her faith. “And that was the thing, in the beginning, it was like, ‘Okay, God, we know this is, just wasn’t Your timing. And that is all right. We will bounce back and figure our way through it.’”

After suffering a second miscarriage in 2017 and a third in 2018, “at that point, it was just kind of like, ‘Okay, like, what’s the deal? What is all of this?’” said Underwood.

“I had always been afraid to be angry,” Underwood explained of her reaction to the heartbreak on CBS. “Because we are so blessed. And my son, Isaiah, is the sweetest thing. And he’s the best thing in the world. And I’m like, ‘If we can never have any other kids, that’s okay, because he’s amazing.’ And I have this amazing life. Like, really, what can I complain about? I can’t. I have an incredible husband, incredible friends, an incredible job, an incredible kid. Can I be mad? No.”

But when she thought she might be suffering a fourth miscarriage, “I got mad,” Underwood told CBS News’ Tracy Smith.

One of her most emotional moments came as she cuddled with her son and thought, “Why on Earth do I keep getting pregnant if I can’t have a kid? Like, what is this? Shut the door. Like, do something. Either shut the door or let me have a kid.”

“And for the first time, I feel like I actually I told God how I felt,” she added. “That was like a Saturday — and the Monday I went to the doctor to, like, confirm, another miscarriage. And they told me everything was great!”

She said, “He heard me.”

In the cover story for Redbook’s September issue, Underwood expressed worry that her window for expanding her family could be closing. “I’m 35, so we may have missed our chance to have a big family,” she noted, leading to some mixed reactions from fans.

“We always talk about adoption and about doing it when our child or children are a little older,” she added. “In the meantime, we’re lucky to be a part of organizations that help kids, because our focus right now in our lives is helping as many kids as possible.”

She also got candid about her tough 2017, which included a rough fall last November. Underwood tripped on the steps outside her Nashville home as she was taking her dogs out, suffering injuries that led to 40-50 stitches in her face and surgery on her broken wrist.

“It was … a very soul-searching year for me,” Underwood recalled to Redbook. “There were some personal things that happened. And I had the accident and all of that to get through … and just life. Life is full of ups and downs, and I might have had a few more downs than ups last year.”

The accident changed the way that she saw herself. “It was also a perception thing, because I look at myself [now] and I see it quite a bit, but other people are like, ‘I wouldn’t have even noticed.’ Nobody else looks at you as much as you think they do. Nobody notices as much as you think they will, so that’s been nice to learn.”

“It just wasn’t pretty,” Underwood said on Today.

Now that Underwood has recovered from the injury and is expecting her second child, the superstar her family are preparing for some exciting changes. When Jimmy Fallon asked Underwood on The Tonight Show if Isaiah understands his new role as a big brother, Underwood said, “I don’t think for real he does.”

She gushed, “He’ll be really sweet and talk to my belly and kiss my belly. He’s the sweetest little boy. But no kid can really know that their life is going to change… He’ll have to share Mommy.”","carrie underwood

Until now! Tonight’s episode will introduce Bruce Campbell as property developer-on-a-downward spiral Gary Green. So, what can the beloved Evil Dead actor tell us about the character?

“Gary Green, he’s kind of the guy that you go to if you want to get anything done,” says Campbell. “He can develop anything, he can get around most laws, he’s been at this game a long time, he plays at a very high level. I think he’s like your shopping mall-kind of guy, large projects where it’s not done fully above board, which makes him a very standard guy. There are a lot of these guys who I know in the film business. Very successful people who make a lot of money and they’re not very honest. But it doesn’t make them unlikeable either. There’s a lot of likable cads.”

The actor shared scenes with Lodge 49 stars Wyatt Russell, who plays feckless surfer Sean “Dud” Dudley, and Brent Jennings, who portrays unlucky-in-love plumbing salesman Ernie Fontaine.

“Those guys are great,” says Campbell. “I’m coming into their show, doing a little three-episode dance, and they were very gracious. You know, Wyatt, it’s funny, I had worked with his dad Kurt a couple of times, and so we sort of laughed about that. I’m like, I keep running into his dad and now, it’s typical, now I work with his son! And Brent was just awesome. You know, incredible low-key guy and his performance was low-key, but when you watch it, I mean, he’s awesome. There are actors that are obviously awesome and other actors who are subtly awesome.”

Campbell was contacted about the part by Paul Giamatti. The Billions actor is an executive producer on the show and almost appeared with Campbell in an ultimately-never-shot sequel to the horror cult classic Bubba Ho-Tep.

“We went out to dinner, and we jibber-jabbered, and couldn’t quite make that work,” says Campbell of the aborted project. “But I’ve always been a big fan, and we kept looking for ways to intersect, and this one made perfect sense. He was my boss. I liked that!”

Is he a good boss?

“He’s pretty good, yeah,” says the actor. “He was almost complimentary.”

Netflix’s throwback sci-fi smash provided the inspiration for one of the legendary mazes (joining Poltergeist, The First Purge, and Universal Monsters, among others) at Universal’s annual haunted extravaganza, during which the park is filled with an assortment of pop-up haunted attractions that recreate beloved horror properties in stunning, screaming detail.

Halloween Horror Nights kicked off this weekend in Universal Studios’ Hollywood and Orlando parks (and will open Sept. 28 in Singapore). Members of the cast of Stranger Things attended opening night in California on Friday and checked out the maze, which steers guests through a host of Hawkins landmarks like the Byers home, the middle school, the laboratory, and, of course, the Upside-Down in all of its slime-covered glory.

Joshua Blanchard/Getty Images

Universal Studios Hollywood Creative Director John Murdy took EW on a tour of the maze and shared some of the stranger secrets about how he and his team worked their haunted magic to bring the show to life — and scare the crap out of the parks’ guests.

The maze begins in the forest, on the night when Will Byers goes missing. Guests encounter his bicycle, overturned, wheels still spinning and headlight blinking, and get a first brief glimpse of the hideous Demogorgon. “Like the show, we want to tease the Demogorgon — we don’t want to just have you walk into the maze and, ah, there it is,” Murdy explains. ‘We want to kind of build up the suspense of seeing him.”

They lead up to the full reveal of the monster throughout the maze, by showing it backlit behind a screen, projecting the sound of it roaring and stalking Will through the woods, and stretching out the walls of the Byers’ house as it reaches for a victim. Murdy estimates that there are about 10 fully costumed scare-actors playing Demogorgons throughout the maze, wearing state-of-the-art creature suits that required some movie magic to build.

First, Murdy reached out to the special effects house that made the original Demogorgon suit for Netflix, to see if he could use the exact same molds that were used for the show, but when he saw them, green-screen gaps at the face and feet revealed that Stranger Things partially relied on computer animation to bring its monster to life. “So instead, we had a positive made off of the mold for the show, and then our sculptor could literally sit there with it right in front of him and sculpt our version of it,” Murdy says.

David Sprague/Universal Studios Hollywood

There were more challenges in bringing other characters to life, the age of the stars being one of them. “It doesn’t really work to take a 20-something-year-old actor and go, ‘you’re playing a 12-year-old,’” Murdy says. So they brought the preteen protagonists into the action by positioning their walkie-talkies throughout the maze, using the audio straight from the show of all of them talking and trying to track down Will. They also relied on artists to bring versions of Dustin, Eleven, and Will to life with elaborately sculpted pieces that look just like the actors, dressed in their exact wardrobe. Fully costumed scare-actors playing Joyce having a breakdown, Nancy searching for Jonathan, Hopper saving the day, and Dr. Brenner calmly encouraging guests to enter the portal and meet their doom also appear in the haunted soundstage.

“It’s one of those rare properties that transcends the narrow confines of its genre and it becomes this huge pop culture phenomenon,” Murdy says of Stranger Things. “You have a fanbase that’s utterly obsessed with the show — so you have to hit all the details for them.” Nowhere is that attention to detail more evident than in the dressing of the Byers home, where Christmas lights blink over a carefully disheveled living room, with a rotary phone emitting sparks on the parquet floor and real vintage ‘80s newspapers covering up the hole Joyce chopped into the wall.

David Sprague/Universal Studios Hollywood

Will’s room includes exact replicas of his monster drawings from the show, science trophies engraved with his name, and a boombox which, at the time of EW’s tour with Murdy, still needed some tweaking. “I went and looked at the tape, and I’m like, ‘that’s the Carpenters,’” he says. “It’s not the Carpenters [on the show]. I have that album by the Clash, it’s called Combat Rock. I think I still have a cassette somewhere in my shed.”

Exiting Will’s room amid assurances that Murdy would track down his old Clash tape — “so that if anybody looks, it’s actually is the right cassette” — brings us to the portal that Nancy uses to enter the Upside-Down. Guests in the maze aren’t going to crawl like she did, of course, but other than that, the Horror Nights recreation is shockingly accurate, right down to the little glowing pieces that float in the air throughout. Some of them, sticking out from the walls, are “are individual strands of fiber optics that our special effects team had to painstakingly wrap in cotton, and that’s to diffuse the source of light,” Murdy explains. “In addition to that, we also have projectors all over the room, and that’s going to be projecting the floating particles as well, and then you put it all together and you get all these different layers.”

As you navigate the space in the dim light of the floating particles, the synthesizer Stranger Things score pressing you onward, try not to trip on the fake bloody deer, which definitely doesn’t look fake! “It’s the form of a taxidermied animal, it’s not a real animal,” Murdy assures us. “It’s fake. It’s all fake.”

After finally making it through the middle school — “the only thing scarier than the Upside-Down,” as Murdy rightly notes — guests can recover from their Demogorgon encounters with Stranger Things-themed food like the Flamin’ Hot Cheeto-encrusted Upside-Down Burger or the Eggo mountain called Eleven’s Waffle Extravaganza.

Universal Studios Hollywood

While the whole experience is a few minutes of screams for guests, the maze is the culmination of a year of work for Murdy and his team. They invited Netflix reps to Horror Nights last year to pitch the company on being part of the event, but the Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer required no convincing. “The Duffer Brothers are huge fans of Horror Nights,” Murdy says. “They keep reiterating, ‘you don’t understand how important this is to us.’ So that’s always kind of the creative ideal.” The Duffers have been champions of the maze ever since Murdy wrote his first treatment of it — way back in December.

“That’s kind of the cycle of Horror Nights now,” he says. “It never ends. I’m already making deals for next year.”

Halloween Horror Nights runs select nights beginning Sept. 14 at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando Resort and Sept. 28 at Universal Studios Singapore. Tickets are available now.","waffle extravaganza universal studios hollywood

A new clip from the live-action DC Universe series — unveiled on Batman Day, no less — reveals a meeting of the Robins. Dick (Brenton Thwaites), a.k.a. Nightwing/the “old” Robin, encounters Jason Todd (Curran Walters), a.k.a. the “new” Robin/Dick’s replacement.

Jason thinks being the Boy Wonder is pretty “dope.” He’s “kickin’ asses, being famous,” and driving the Batmobile. That last remark, though, preys on Dick’s jealousy.

When Robin meets Robin, things can get a little awkward. Get ready for TITANS, only on #DCUniverse next month! #DCUTitans pic.twitter.com/IrMl1LVjCy — DCUTitans (@DCUTitans) September 15, 2018

“Jason has filled my job,” Thwaites told EW of Jason’s introduction. “When I left, I was under the impression that Batman didn’t have a Robin, and Jason basically shows up at a weaker of my moments and saves me, essentially, and tells me he’s the Robin working for Batman. I guess there’s a sense of jealousy and remorse and a little bit of anger and frustration for Jason for filling [that role] that was to perform all of the bad and negative and destructive things that Dick Grayson had just left.”

He continued: “So, Dick is trying to teach him that the things that he is doing and the morals that he stands for aren’t necessarily good and there’s a lot of conflict and tension just based around what their modus operundi is — what Jason fights for and the reasons why he fights crime aren’t necessarily the same as Dick Grayson, and I feel like Dick is trying to mentor him and teach him a different way and Jason doesn’t want a part of it.”

Executive producer Geoff Johns called this character meeting “delightful.” Let’s focus on that instead of what Jason’s comic book origins may or may not tell us about his future on the series.

Titans is a much more gritty take on the Teen Titans comic book lineup. Dick begins the series as a detective, who’s trying to distance himself from his violent past as Batman’s sidekick. He’ll encounter a troubled girl named Raven, the daughter of a demon, and hit the road as they flee forces looking to take advantage of her powers. Along the way, they’ll pick up familiar Titans characters Starfire and Beast Boy.

The show will premiere on the DC Universe streaming platform beginning Oct. 12 with new episodes arriving every Friday.

He was 90.

His wife, Maria, confirmed the news to The New York Times, citing the cause of death as complications with diabetes.

Donat played William Mulder, father of David Duchovny’s Fox Mulder, on six episodes of The X-Files opposite Rebecca Toolan as Teena Mulder. However, the Canadian-born actor’s career spanned across stage and film, as well.

“He had an easy gravitas as a performer and seemed to come from that generation that took the art seriously but not too seriously,” Duchovny wrote of Donat in an email to The Times.

Born Pierre Collingwood Donat on Jan. 20, 1928, in Kentville, Nova Scotia, Donat held Hawaii Five-O, Dallas, Murder, She Wrote, The Outer Limits, and Hill Street Blues among his list of guest-starring TV roles. On the big screen, he appeared in The Godfather Part II, War of the Roses, The Game, and Tucker: The Man and His Dream. Donat was once considered for the role of Tom Hagen in The Godfather, but it ultimately went to Robert Duvall.

With theater, he performed through organizations like the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco (where he would get to know director Francis Ford Coppola) and the Stratford Festival in Canada.

In addition to Maria, Donat is survived by sons Caleb, Christopher, and Lucas; stepdaughters Barbara Park Shapiro and Marina Park Sutton; stepson Malcolm Park; 11 grandchildren; and brother Richard, according to Variety.","kentville nova scotia donat

As Newton slid to the ground, Kazee dove low and made helmet contact with Newton, causing Newton to go to the sideline momentarily to be checked by the medical staff. Panthers wide receiver Torrey Smith then went after Kazee, but Smith was not ejected. Smith did receive an unnecessary roughness penalty to offset Kazee's.

Kazee was in the starting lineup Sunday after the Falcons lost starting strong safety Keanu Neal to a season-ending ACL tear. Kazee actually started at free safety, with starting free safety Ricardo Allen moving over to strong safety.

Jordan Richards entered the game after Kazee got ejected.

Kazee was flagged for two helmet infractions during the preseason.","atlanta atlanta falcons safety

(0:52)

Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz still needs final medical clearance, but he is on track to return next Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts, league sources tell ESPN.

Philadelphia has been cautious about rushing Wentz back from last season's knee injury, despite how strong he has looked in practice.

Editor's Picks Foles continues to get starting nod for Eagles Carson Wentz still has not been cleared for contact, meaning Nick Foles will again be the starting quarterback for the Eagles for their Week 2 game vs. the Bucs.

There were some within the Eagles organization who thought that, from a football standpoint, Wentz was ready to play Week 1, though the team stuck to a plan it had laid out for the star quarterback, taking a long-range view.

Wentz tore it up at practice this past Wednesday -- the nine-month anniversary of his injury -- looking sharp and ready for action. All that remains is being medically cleared, which is likely to happen as early as this week, according to sources.

Nick Foles once again will start at quarterback Sunday when the defending-champion Eagles face the Buccaneers. The reigning Super Bowl MVP is 6-1 as Philadelphia's starter -- including regular season and postseason -- since Wentz tore two knee ligaments in Week 14 last season.

Eagles coach Doug Pederson said this past Wednesday that Wentz is doing ""great."" He continues to take part in team drills by working with the scout team in practice. According to ESPN's Chris Mortensen, the player-tracking data that the Eagles use indicates that Wentz has hit a vital threshold -- the ability to protect himself.

""That's correct,"" said Pederson, when asked whether Wentz's GPS data is trending in a positive direction. ""That's what we've seen really since he came back into 11-on-11 as training camp progressed.""

Organizers with the group Chicago Rideshare Advocates are working to organize the thousands of drivers across the city to demand better pay and working conditions. Last week the group rallied outside City Hall with a banner that read, “Uber/Lyft Stop Abusing Workers/Cities.”

Mattia Nanfria, a 41-year-old ride-share driver who also organizes with Chicago Rideshare Advocates said she has been propositioned and attacked by riders. She said that after reporting having problems with some riders, Uber didn’t seem to do much to address the issue. “For all I know, they did nothing, which is a little disturbing,” she said.

To make matters worse, Nanfria said there are some weeks when she makes less than the city’s minimum $12 hourly wage. “The weeks where I’m clearing $10 to $12 an hour, that’s what I lose sleep over,” Nanfria told the Sun-Times.

Chicago city officials have considered following New York’s lead and putting a cap on the number of ride-share vehicles in the city, which has quadrupled to nearly 66,000 drivers in the last three years, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Chicago Rideshare Associates are on board with capping the number of drivers, along with increasing wages and drivers’ safety.

“Nobody wants to ban Uber and Lyft. Nobody wants that,” Eli Martin, a co-organizer of Chicago Rideshare Advocates told the Sun-Times. “We all like this, we just have to make it work better.”

Both Uber and Lyft oppose the proposal for a license cap.

The surge in ride-sharing services in Chicago has hurt business for cab and taxi drivers, while also worsening working conditions for Uber and Lyft drivers.

Earlier this year, Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi suggested that New York City officials should impose a fee on ride-sharing apps to help taxi medallion owners facing financial burdens from the increase of ride-sharing services. But the New York Taxi Workers Alliance called the proposal “a slap in the face to struggling drivers and an attempt to get out of being regulated.”

Chicago officials have proposed raising the average wage for drivers, which is currently less than the minimum wage at $11.53 an hour after expenses.

The group will hold its rally at the O’Hare Transportation Network Providers’ parking lot from 7-10 p.m. on Monday.","new york taxi workers alliance

The film collected an estimated $24 million in theaters in the U.S. and Canada, beating three new releases, ComScore Inc. said in an email Sunday. “A Simple Favor” placed third, “White Boy Rick” came in fourth, and a new faith-based movie “Unbroken: Path to Redemption” was landed in ninth.

Fox tapped director Shane Black, the creator of “Lethal Weapon,” to freshen the three-decade-old “Predator” franchise. But the film has had a rocky debut. The studio cut a scene involving an actor who’s a registered sex offender after lead actress Olivia Munn complained. The incident comes at a time when Hollywood is embroiled in sexual-misconduct allegations against senior executives and stars across the industry.

In the film, a young boy triggers the return of the Predators to Earth. A disgruntled science teacher and a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers must then fight to stop the end of mankind.

Only 34 percent of critics recommended it, according to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The New York Observer called the movie a “grab bag of averageness.”

“The Predator” cost $88 million to produce before marketing costs and was expected to collect $29 million, according to Box Office Mojo. Walt Disney Co. is slated to complete a takeover of Fox’s movie business next year.

Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.’s thriller “A Simple Favor” was largely liked by critics and collected $16.1 million. Directed by Paul Feig, it features Anna Kendrick as a mommy vlogger trying to figure out the disappearance of her best friend, who is played by Blake Lively. Henry Golding, the lead actor in “Crazy Rich Asians,” also features in the film. It was forecast to open to $15 million, according to Box Office Pro. The budget wasn’t disclosed.

Sony Pictures, with Jeff Robinov’s Studio 8, released “White Boy Rick,”which features Matthew McConaughey, and opened to $8.8 million against a forecast of $7.9 million by Box Office Pro. Set in Detroit in the 1980s at the height of the crack epidemic, the movie tells the story of a blue-collar worker and his teenage son. The movie estimated to have cost about $29 million.

“Unbroken: Path to Redemption” collected $2.4 million from 1,620 theaters and was expected to generate $5 million, Box Office Mojo said.","box office mojo walt disney co

Sabri Haddouche tweeted about the bug, a webpage with just 15 lines of code on Saturday. Simply visiting the website can crash and restart an iPhone or iPad.

Haddouche posted the information on GitHub—including the source code of the bug, which is just a few lines of CSS and HTML.

“Anything that renders HTML on iOS is affected,” Haddouche told TechCrunch, which means that you will be affected by the bug if someone sends you the link via social media or email, or if you visit a webpage that includes the code.

According to 9to5Mac, “The computationally-expensive drawing overloads the WebKit renderer and the system cannot recover other than to kernel panic, crash to the Apple logo, and reboot.” WebKit is the HTML layout engine used by the Safari browser, as well as Mail, App Store, and other apps on macOS, iOS, and Linux.

Deliveries to customers in Amsterdam, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, and Shanghai will be done mostly by electric vehicle to meet zero emissions environmental goals.

“For us it’s crucial to grow our business in a sustainable way—that’s why we’re speeding up the transition to EV in five inner city areas,” Ikea Group CEO Jesper Brodin said in a statement. “By 2020 all our home deliveries in central Amsterdam, Los Angeles, New York, Paris and Shanghai will be by EV or other zero emission solutions.”

The Swedish furniture company joined the initiative by the Climate Group, EV100, in 2017, promising to meet this goal by 2020, provide access to electric vehicle charging stations at Ikea locations by 2020, make all home deliveries zero emission by 2025, and cut in half emissions from Ikea employees and customers by 2030.

Other companies that are part of that group include HP, Unilever, and PG&E.

Among EV100 members, Ikea is leading the way. The company pledged in June to remove all single-use plastic—like plastic straws and plates for Swedish meatballs—from its stores by 2020.

“By switching to EVs for home deliveries at this pace, IKEA is setting a strong example for clean transport in city centers, where zero emissions zones will one day become the norm,” Climate Group CEO Helen Clarkson said in a statement. “They are enabling their customers to play a key part in accelerating the roll out of electric vehicles overall.”","amsterdam los angeles new york paris

The deaths include a woman and child who were killed when a tree fell on their home, a mother of two who was driving when her vehicle hit a tree in the road, three people who died from flash-flooding, and a couple who died in a house fire.

More than 740,000 people were without power on Sunday morning in the Carolinas, CNN reported. But earlier reports suggested that 3 million people could be affected by power outages. Parts of North Carolina could still see up to 40 inches of rain going into Monday, according to USA Today.

“These rainfall amounts will produce catastrophic flash flooding, prolonged significant river flooding and an elevated risk for landslides in western North Carolina and far southwest Virginia,” the National Hurricane Center warned in a public advisory. The NHC also warned of possible tornadoes into Sunday evening in North Carolina and eastern South Carolina.

Some places in parts of North Carolina were still issuing evacuation orders on Sunday. Fayetteville residents living within one mile of the Cape Fear river and the Little River were told to evacuate by 3 p.m. local time, due to the potential for river flooding.

“If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Fayetteville Mayor Mitch Colvin warned, according to USA Today.

Western North Carolina is also at risk of landslides, the National Hurricane Center warned early Sunday.","north carolina

“I just decided I’m no longer a Republican,” said Wexner, founder, chairman, and CEO of the Columbus, Ohio-based retailer that owns Victoria’s Secret, Henri Bendel, and Bath and Body Works, to a small group of Ohio business leaders, according to the Columbus Dispatch.

“I’m an independent,” he added. “I won’t support this nonsense in the Republican Party.”

Wexner has criticized President Donald Trump before, especially after Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. a year ago and over Trump’s immigration policies.

The CEO made a $300,000 donation last year to With Honor, a PAC that supports military veterans running for office who agree to meet with members of their opposing party. His Democratic wife, Abigail Wexner, donated $2.5 million to the same cause, the Dispatch reported.

The event was part of Wexner’s work with the Columbus Partnership, a group of Ohio business leaders through which Wexner has promoted the importance of civility between political parties.

Wexner announced his departure from the Republican Party after President Barack Obama visited Columbus Thursday night on a campaign stop for the state’s governor’s race.

Wexner has been a Republican since college, he told the group of Ohio business leaders, and he has been writing to friends who serve in elected office as Republicans to tell them he is now an independent.

The CEO has been at the helm of L Brands for more than 50 years, making him the longest-serving chairman on the Fortune 500 list.

“I just have to say something,” Wexner said. “If you don’t think things are right, open your mouth.”","charlottesville va

According to some experts, Mangkhut could be the biggest storm to hit Hong Kong “since records began.” We’ll see. But since moving a few years ago from a downtown high-rise to a beachside village on Hong Kong Island’s southeastern tip, I’ve learned the hard way to take typhoon warnings seriously. As I write, I can hear the waves booming; they’re expected to reach 23 feet by tomorrow night.

Typhoons aren’t the only area in which China is giving the U.S. a run for its money. Tech Node founder Gang Lu complains in an essay published yesterday that virtually all the features touted by Apple CEO Tim Cook at Apple’s Sept. 13 launch event as breakthrough innovations unique to the latest generation of iPhones are, in fact, derivatives of technologies already widely used in China. Lu describes himself as a die-hard Apple fan. But he laments that big screens, borderless screens, dual-cameras, and dual-SIM cards are commonplace in China. Lu’s conclusion after watching the Apple roll-out: “For the first time, I found iPhone is replaceable.”

The Wall Street Journal concurs that Apple’s “Chinese rivals already offer similar features for less money.” The Journal argues Apple has adopted many of those new features for the express purpose of hanging on to Chinese consumers, who account for about a fifth of the company’s global sales. Will a copy-cat strategy be enough to help Apple maintain, much less grow, its China market share?

* * *

While Apple has assiduously courted the China market, Google has—until recently—remained a conscientious objector. The U.S. search giant began operating in China in 2000. In 2005, Google hired Microsoft tech leader Kai-Fu Lee to head its China operations and, by 2009, claimed a 36% market share in China with a limited search product that bowed to some government censorship restrictions. In 2010, Google abruptly withdrew from China, citing repressive censorship rules and attacks on its own systems by Chinese government-backed hackers.

Recent reports suggest Google is having second thoughts about that decision and is developing a censor-friendly search product called “Dragonfly.” In a New York Times column Kara Swisher argues Google’s return to China would be a far greater scandal than its refusal to provide a platform for conservative extremists in the U.S.. Swisher ascribes Google’s eagerness to abandon its principles in China to data lust. She cites a central thesis of Kai-Fu Lee’s new book, “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order”: the future of computing “will be enjoyed only by those with the ability to essentially shove increasing amounts of data into the maw of the machine.”

But is that thesis true? Does the future of AI belong to those with access to the deepest oceans of crunchable data? Or are there alternative approaches to AI that don’t depend on scale alone? It’s a topic we’re thinking about a lot at Fortune these days, not least because “Innovation in the Age of AI” is the theme of this year’s Fortune Global Tech Forum in Guangzhou. If you have insights, we’d love to hear from you.

Why Is Trump Kneecapping It?,http://fortune.com/2018/09/15/financial-crisis-2008-anniversary/,https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/lehman-brothers-sign.jpg,business,2018-09-16 14:23:31.214622,"Over a two-day period 10 years ago, the financial crisis of 2008 hit full stride: Lehman Brothers failed, the mega-insurer AIG was bailed out, and Bank of America announced the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. The meltdown had started long before, but Sept. 15 and 16 made it clear to everyone that a financial apocalypse could be in the offing.

One of the culprits in causing the crisis—which wound up costing every American $70,000, according to new research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve—was a lack of appreciation for systemic risk, or the extent to which financial giants were interconnected and how much activity was occurring in shadowy, non-bank corners where no watchdogs lurked, threatening the entire system.

Regulators didn’t have enough information, and what they did have they didn’t share with each other. When the mortgage market went south, nearly everyone in government was caught off guard by how little they knew regarding the tenuous strands holding the financial markets together.

One aspect of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law is aimed at addressing this shortcoming: the creation of the Office of Financial Research (OFR), an important body that is far from a household name. Sadly, its low profile has allowed it to be kneecapped by Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration. Failing to let the office do its job properly makes another financial crisis more likely.

Much like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was meant to correct the scattershot nature of consumer regulations, the OFR aims to address the fact that financial data is collected by a host of different agencies—when it is collected at all—and that those agencies not only don’t share the data with each other, but don’t use it to craft a picture of risk across the system as a whole.

The office is independently funded and empowered to issue subpoenas if it doesn’t get the data it wants. In theory, it’s supposed to feed info to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, another entity created in the wake of the crisis with a mandate to spot and address systemic threats.

The OFR has done some good work, including standardizing global data to more easily spot and assess risk. But it’s been dealt blow after blow from Republicans, which has limited its effectiveness.

For instance, the Trump administration has cut its budget by 25% and laid off some 40 employees. Trump has nominated Dino Falaschetti to be the office’s director; Falaschetti previously worked under House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, who has sought to eliminate the OFR altogether. Even before Trump’s presidency, Republicans in Congress evinced no love for the office’s work, characterizing it as just another worthless bureaucracy and driving down the office’s morale.

That’s not a recipe for crafting a successful agency.

It’s not that the OFR is singlehandedly going to prevent another financial meltdown, of course. Like much of Dodd-Frank, it’s an untested tool that is only as good as it’s allowed to be and will only be useful if the policymakers in charge take advantage of it. But it aims to correct a real problem.

In September 2008, regulators were blindsided by the extent of the financial system’s fragility. Preventing the OFR from producing robust work ensures those blind spots will persist.

And the situation isn't much better elsewhere.,2018-09-14T19:53:50Z,fortune,A Startling New Report on America's Obesity Problem,http://fortune.com/2018/09/14/cdc-obesity-report/,https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/obesity-report-cdc-e1536954339518.jpg,business,2018-09-16 14:23:31.214622,"America’s obesity problem isn’t exactly a secret. It’s a well-established reality that has widespread public health consequences, including the prevalence of chronic health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.

But a new report from Trust for America’s Health and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation breaks down the most recently available obesity statistics, based on Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data, on a state-wide, and sobering, basis, finding that seven U.S. states have adult obesity rates that exceed 35%.

“[N]ew state level data from the CDC’s 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) show that adult obesity rates rose by statistically significant amounts in six states and no states experienced a reduction in rates of obesity,” write the study authors. “According to the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 18.5 percent of children and 39.6 percent of adults had obesity in 2015-2016. These are the highest rates ever documented by NHANES.” Those numbers suggest more than 93 million Americans are obese.

Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and West Virginia were the seven states found to have adult obesity rates higher than 35%, according to the study. Only Hawaii, Colorado, and the District of Columbia had rates lower than 25%.

The CDC says that this public health crisis isn’t just widespread—it’s expensive. “The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the United States was $147 billion in 2008 US dollars; the medical cost for people who have obesity was $1,429 higher than those of normal weight,” according to the agency.

But obesity is also a particularly difficult problem to solve given its disproportionate effect on racial minorities and poorer Americans. That’s tied to the wide-ranging, critical role that socioeconomics plays in public health, whether it be convenient access to affordable, nutritious food or a generally healthy environment. What’s clear is the problem is rampant, pricey (for individuals and the health system alike), and a tough issue to fix.

The set up was supposed to use readily available facial recognition software to project images onto people’s faces. But the software couldn’t identify African-American Buolamwini’s own face—unless she put on a white mask. She tells the story in more detail in a TED talk.

As she encountered other examples of what’s become known as algorithmic bias, Buolamwini decided to conduct a more rigorous review. Putting three well-known facial recognition programs to the test (including ones from IBM and Microsoft), she found that all had a significantly harder time correctly identifying darker skinned faces, particularly of women.

Her next step has been to attack the problem of algorithmic bias head on, forming the Algorithmic Justice League, a group of real life superheroes with the mission of ferreting out and eliminating bias in the machine learning and artificial intelligence programs that are being used not just for mundane tasks like identifying your friends in a Facebook photo, but also making life-changing decisions in the realms of healthcare, insurance, and criminal justice.

I first met Buolamwini just last week, when I moderated a panel on the ethics of AI at a conference in Boston sponsored by AI software developer Affectiva. She and her fellow panelists, Rumman Chowdhury, global lead for responsible AI at Accenture, and Mark Latonero of the Data & Society Research Institute, offered more than a few ways to combat the problems we discussed.

To start, Buolamwini believes that “who codes matters,” because more diverse teams of programmers can be more aware of preventing algorithmic bias from creeping in. The sets of data used to train facial recognition or other kinds of apps need to be diverse, too. That may have been why the program Buolamwini used for her Aspire Mirror couldn’t identify black faces. Finally, she supports deeper consideration of the laws and practices around potential uses of AI. It’s a conversation that needs to be had immediately.","data society research institute

Mexican national Christhian Bahena Rivera, 24, is due in court in Montezuma, Iowa, to be arraigned on a murder charge in connection with the 20-year-old’s death.

Prosecutors said Tibbetts was jogging July 18 in the Iowa town of Brooklyn when she was killed.

The search for the young woman generated national headlines for more than a month. The search ended when Rivera led cops to her body in a cornfield.

Defense attorney Chad Frese told the Des Moines Register Friday that he requested that the arraignment be conducted in open court.

""Since this is a class A felony for a homicide, I want it to be on the record so there’s no confusion whatsoever,"" Frese told the paper. ""Because his education is about a fifth- or sixth-grade education in the country of Mexico.""

On Wednesday, a judge granted a motion for the services of a private investigator to assist Rivera’s defense at public expense, KWWL-TV reported Friday.

“Without the appointment of an investigator at state expense, defendant will be deprived of his constitutional right to a full and complete defense and equal protection under the law,” Frese and his wife and co-counsel Jennifer Frese said in motion papers.

The motion granted the Freses $5,000 in state funds to hire a Des Moines private investigation firm.

The lawyers pointed out that it’s likely there will be other requests for money for the private investigator, the station reported.

Rivera said in an affidavit attached to the motion that he was indigent. It said he had no job and no cash. It said he has epxenses of $270 a month in car payments.

Previously, the judge appointed a Spanish interpreter at public expense to assist the defense.

Rivera’s family is paying for his lawyers, the Register has reported.","christhian bahena rivera

The Canadian national, who played for the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Carolina Hurricanes before retiring in 2016, began receiving backlash right away for the multiple hunting photos – including from comedian Ricky Gervais.

Some of the threats of violence were so extreme, Brent posted that he contacted Twitter. However, the social media platform said the threats did not violate their abuse policy.

Brent has called out the criticisms as what “hunters and conservationists” are “up against.”

Though, there have been a few that have defended Brent, and his wife Eva Shockey-Brent, who is a well known hunter and first woman in three decades to make the cover of Field & Stream.

“STHU!! You know nothing about this sport keep your negative comments to yourself or better yet why don’t you cry about to your fellow yuppies & tree hugging vegan friends nobody is on your page harassing you & your lifestyle so carry on hater please & thank you!” one wrote on Instagram.

According to the Yukon Environmental agency, the bag limit for grizzly bears is one for every three license years. Bears in the wild usually live 20-25 years and males can reach up to 600 pounds.

John Kennedy called the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh “an intergalactic freak show” and said he was embarrassed for Congress by the accusations of sexual misconduct leveled at the Supreme Court nominee.

“So far, it’s pretty much been an intergalactic freak show,” Kennedy, R-La., told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “Most Americans are looking at this – most mainstream Americans – and they’re thinking that Congress has hit rock bottom and started to dig.”

Kennedy added: “I have been embarrassed by the whole process and, frankly, I’m – no disrespect to Senator Feinstein or to Stanford Law School – but I’m a little bit offended. I sit on Judiciary Committee. They’ve had this stuff for three months. If they were serious about it, they should’ve told us about it.”

The Louisiana lawmaker was referencing a secret letter that has been the subject of intrigue on Capitol Hill over the last week. A source familiar with the confirmation proceedings told Fox News that California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., received the letter back in July, but did not make its existence known publicly until Thursday.

The letter was relayed to lawmakers by 51-year-old research pyschologist Christine Blasey Ford and concerns an incident involving the 53-year-old Kavanaugh and her while they were in high school. According to two officials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times, the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and the woman.

“Most Americans are looking at this – most mainstream Americans – and they’re thinking that Congress has hit rock bottom and started to dig,” Kennedy said.

In a statement released by the White House Friday, Kavanaugh said: ""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.""

Senate Republicans insist Kavanaugh's confirmation remains on track for a committee vote this upcoming Thursday. But the allegation has inflamed an already intense political battle over President Trump's nominee. It also pushes the #MeToo movement into the court fight, less than two months before congressional elections that have seen a surge of female Democratic candidates.

The New Yorker magazine reported that the alleged incident took place at a party when Kavanaugh, now 53, was attending Georgetown Preparatory School. The woman making the allegation attended a nearby school.

The accusations against Kavanaugh resurfaced similar ones leveled against Associate Justice Clarence Thomas during his own confirmation hearings in 1991. Anita Hill accused Thomas, who was her supervisor at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, of sexually harassing her. Thomas denied those allegations and was confirmed.

Hill, who is now a professor at Brandeis University, urged the Senate to put in place a process for people to come forward.

""Even in the #MeToo era, it remains incredibly difficult to report harassment, abuse or assault by people in power,"" she said.

The eleventh-hour revelations drew sharp criticism not only from Feinstein’s Republican colleagues in the Senate, but from the media in her home state of California, with the San Francisco Chronicle calling the allegations “unfair all around.”

""Feinstein’s treatment of a more than three-decades-old sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was unfair all around,” the newspaper’s editorial board noted on Sunday. “It was unfair to Kavanaugh, unfair to his accuser and unfair to Feinstein’s colleagues — Democrats and Republicans alike — on the Senate Judiciary Committee.”

The editorial continued: “Feinstein… took the worst possible course by waiting until almost a week after Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing was completed to ominously announce that she had turned over ‘information from an individual’ about Kavanaugh to the FBI, and adding that she would be honoring the person’s 'strongly requested' confidentiality.”

While Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court seems likely, it is not guaranteed and he will certainly not be a unanimous pick.

Feinstein penned an opinion piece for the Los Angeles Times over the weekend, explaining that she strongly opposes Kavanaugh's nomination because of his stance on issues ranging from reproductive rights to judicial deference.

“Supreme Court justices should not be an extension of the Republican Party,” Feinstein wrote. “They must also have unquestionable character and integrity, and serious questions remain about Judge Kavanaugh in this regard, as indicated in information I referred to the FBI. For these and other reasons detailed below, I strongly oppose Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court.”

Kennedy told “Fox News Sunday” that he believes it will be a close vote for Kavanaugh, but in the end the judge will join the Supreme Court.

“I think the vote will be 11-10 Wallace,” Kennedy said. “Straight party line vote. I think the nomination will come to the floor; that’ll be up to Senator (Mitch) McConnell (a Republican from Kentucky). I think every Republican will vote for Judge Kavanaugh. I think at least two and probably more Democrats will.”

Williams told Australia’s “The Project” that she and Mouratoglou “never had signals” that would count as coaching, The Australian reported, citing the preview clip released Sunday. Chair umpire Carlos Ramos issued a violation after he suspected Mouratoglou of coaching Williams during her defeat against Japan’s Naomi Osaka on Sept. 8.

“He said he made a motion,” she told host Lisa Wilkinson in an interview set to air next Sunday. “I don’t understand what he was talking about. We’ve never had signals.”

US OPEN UMPIRE WHO ISSUED VIOLATIONS AGAINST SERENA WILLIAMS SPEAKS OUT

Williams, who accused the umpire of sexism for his harsh treatment on her, also spoke about the double standard in the sport.

“I just don’t understand…if you’re a female you should be able to do even half of what a guy can do,” Williams said.

The tennis star’s statement on the coaching violation contradicts what Mouratoglou said following Williams’ 6-2, 6-4 loss against Osaka.

“I’m honest, I was coaching. I mean, I don’t think she looked at me so that’s why she didn’t even think I was. But I was like 100 percent of the coaches on [sic] 100 percent of the matches,” Mouratoglou told ESPN.

Williams received three violations during the U.S. Open final following clashes with the umpire that drew both praise and criticism from fans and stars. Along with the warning on coaching, Williams was docked for smashing her racket in frustration that led to a point loss. She continued to argue with Ramos about the initial coaching violation.

“I didn’t get coaching,” Williams said multiple times. “I don’t cheat! I didn’t get coaching. How can you say that? You owe me an apology. I have never cheated in my life!”

The third violation — verbal abuse — came when she called the umpire a “thief.” She received an automatic game loss.

“You will never, ever, ever be on another court of mine as long as you live. You are the liar. When are you going to give me my apology? You owe me an apology. Say it. Say you’re sorry…And you stole a point from me. You’re a thief, too!” Williams yelled at Ramos.

SERENA WILLIAMS FINED $17,000 FOR VIOLATIONS DURING US OPEN FINAL

The tournament referee's office issued a $17,000 fine for three code violations.

On Friday, Williams talked about her fashion business and her family, but not tennis fouls during a 25-minute appearance with Sarah Robb O'Hagan, chief executive of Flywheel Sports, at the National Retail Federation trade show.

O’Hagan praised Williams for calming a riled-up audience that booed the U.S. Open outcome to refocus the moment on Osaka's victory.

""I feel it's really important to stand up for what you believe in,"" Williams said, ""especially if it can affect the future and affect a lot of people in the future. That's what it's all about.""

""I think this represents that even as far as May 2017, we still couldn't answer the question,"" Page said.

Page was responding to Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas, who wanted more information about a May 2017 text where Page, and her then colleague and lover FBI agent Peter Strzok discussed the merits of joining Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team.

Page sat for the transcribed interview before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees in mid-July as part of a joint congressional investigation into the Justice Department's handling of the Russia and Clinton email probes.

According to the transcript, Page stopped mid-answer.""...sorry. Can I consult with counsel? I'm sorry. I need to consult with FBI counsel for a moment.""

Sections of the transcript reviewed by Fox show Ratcliffe pursued the line of questioning at least three more times, and Page provided varying answers.

""I cannot provide the specifics of a confidential interview,"" Ratcliffe told Fox News when asked for comment. ""But I can say that Lisa Page left me with the impression, based on her own words, that the lead investigator of the Russian collusion case, Peter Strzok, had found no evidence of collusion after nearly a year.""

""Lisa Page left me with the impression, based on her own words, that the lead investigator of the Russian collusion case, Peter Strzok, had found no evidence of collusion after nearly a year."" - U.S. Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas

The May 18, 2017, text was highlighted by Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz in his recent report about the handling of the Clinton email probe by the FBI and the Justice Department. The day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's appointment to the Russia probe on May 17, Strzok and Page discussed whether Strzok should join Mueller's team.

""Who gives a f*ck, one more A(ssistant) D(irector)...(versus) (a)n investigation leading to impeachment?"" Strzok texted on May 18, according to the IG report. Strzok later continues, ""...you and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely I'd be there no question. I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern there's no big there there.""

The transcript shows Ratcliffe read the text exchange nearly verbatim to Page, and asked her to explain it, specifically if the lead investigator on the Russia collusion case, agent Strzok believed ""the odds were nothing and that he had a concern that there was no big there there regarding any collusion...""

Page said: ""No, I don't think so. I think it's a reflection of us still not knowing...It still existed in the scope of possibility that there would be literally nothing, probably not nothing nothing, as we probably knew more than that by that point. But in the scheme of the possible outcomes, the most serious one obviously being crimes serious enough to warrant impeachment; but on the other scale that, you know, maybe an unwitting person was, in fact, involved in the release of information, but it didn't ultimately touch any senior, you know, people in the administration or on the campaign. And so the text just sort of reflects that spectrum.""

During the deposition, Page said she was not trying to be ""cagey,"" but that there were restrictions on what she could reveal. ""I'm not supposed to talk about the sufficiency of evidence, so that's why I am weighing my words carefully.""

Page continued: ""Investigations are fluid, right? And so at various times, leads are promising and leads fade away. And so I can't -- I can't answer more his sentiment with respect to this particular text, but certainly at this point the case had been ongoing. We didn't have an answer. That's obvious. And I think we all sort of went back and forth about like what -- what the answer was really going to be.""

May 2017 is a key month because FBI DIrector James Comey was fired by President Trump and Mueller was designated special counsel. In August, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, wrote the still-secret ""scope memo"" spelling out the boundaries for the special counsel investigation.

The texts, and Page's response, congressional sources said, raise significant questions about the probe's predicate and whether by the summer of 2017 it had largely shifted to an obstruction case, not Russia collusion.

Fox News asked Page's lawyer to comment on the congressman's assessment of the deposition, but there was no immediate response.

When Horowitz asked Strzok about the “no big there there” text, Strzok said: ""My question (was) about whether or not this represented a large, coordinated conspiracy or not. And from that, as I looked at what would give me professional fulfillment, what I thought would be the best use of my skills and talents for the FBI and for the United States, whether to take, which path to take.""","john ratcliffe rtexas

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Thousands of people were allowed to return to their homes in Massachusetts on Sunday after a gas leak that set off dozens of house fires, killing one and injuring 25.

On Sunday morning, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency and public safety officials gave residents of Andover, North Andover and Lawrence the all-clear to return to their houses.

Nearly 8,600 affected gas meters had been turned off and approximately 15,000 power outages have been restored, according to officials.

""Its been a difficult and grueling weekend for the residents of Andover, North Andover and Lawrence. I often say the people of Massachusetts are resilient and this devastating situation is no exception,"" said Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker at a press conference on Sunday morning.

Baker said as of 6:30 a.m. ET, all homes in the affected area had been cleared of gas, although the city of Lawrence urged residents not to return to their houses until 7 a.m. ET.

Public safety officials said the next steps in the recovery process would include assessing the damage to the low pressure gas system and technicians inspecting all gas equipment.

“I want to commend the teams of police officers, firefighters and utility workers who worked diligently to meet this morning’s goal of reopening all homes in town to residents,” Andover Town Manager Andrew P. Flanagan said in a statement on Sunday.

Three separate explosions around 4:15 p.m. ET on Thursday and caused as many as 80 homes to be burned or damaged, according to officials.

""The explosions that occurred Thursday night have brought heartbreak for numerous families and the loss of one young life,"" Baker said on Sunday.

Leonel Robson, 18, of Lawrence, Mass., was killed when a chimney from a house explosion in Lawrence fell on the car he was in, officials said.

The explosions and fires initially mystified officials. Baker said at the time the state would work with the federal government to investigate what happened and who should be held accountable.

On Saturday, federal investigators said there didn't appear to been anything intentional behind the blasts.

The National Transportation Safety Board said on Saturday that it planned on looking into how Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, whose pipelines set off Thursday's explosions in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, kept records and how its procedures operated, according to the agency's chairman Robert Sumwalt.

They also plan to take a closer look into recent complaints from the utility's customers, Sumwalt said.

As residents returned to their homes, Columbia Gas urged people not to turn their gas back on.

""Now that most residents are back in their homes, our crews will work to restore gas service. This could take weeks. DO NOT turn your gas back on,"" the company tweeted.

Schools in Andover and North Andover were scheduled to reopen on Monday. However, in Lawrence, officials were still working to determine if reopening on Monday was possible.

At least a dozen families in Lawrence have been permanently displaced by the gas leak, according to a press release.

Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera said a relief fund for those affected by the gas leak had raised $100,000 as of Sunday morning.

As residents returned home, a three alarm fire occurred in Lawrence, but it was later determined that the fire was not in the affected area and was unrelated to the gas explosion.","national transportation safety board

Long told NBC's ""Meet the Press "" on Sunday that Nielsen has not asked for his resignation and that he's cooperating with the DHS inspector general's investigation.

Floodwaters are expected to push many rivers to all-time highs and could spur life-threatening landslides as the hurricane’s remnants move into the mountains in the middle of the states and then up into southwestern Virginia.

The storm has been linked to several deaths, according to officials. Follow Florence’s projected path here and read the latest forecasts here.

Key updates: Florence’s unrelenting rain could bring “catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding risk” | “Extremely hazardous” roads | Florence downgraded to a depression

1:46 p.m.: The storm is spawning an array of safety and environmental hazards

Federal officials described an array of life-safety and environmental hazards spawned by Hurricane Florence in a Sunday afternoon teleconference. Among them: The floodwaters are potentially contaminated and could present a health hazard.

“If you can avoid contact with floodwaters, do so,” said Reggie Cheatham, director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Emergency Management.

He said there are an estimated 3,300 “hog ponds” in North Carolina that hold manure. There is concern that heavy rainfall could cause them to overflow and send hog manure into waterways.

Officials so far are “fairly confident” that farmers prepared adequately in advance of the storm to prevent the ponds from overtopping, Cheatham said. “But we’re not out of the woods yet.”

Cheatham said that, at last count, there had been 28 boil-water orders issued by local water systems.

Meanwhile there has been a significant spill of coal ash from a storage pond at a closed Duke Energy plant near Wilmington, N.C. Cheatham said 2,000 cubic yards of coal ash spilled into a ditch after floodwaters eroded a portion of the pond wall. That ditch leads to a cooling pond that has an outflow into the Cape Fear River, but he said there’s no evidence so far that the coal ash has reached that cooling pond.

Duke Energy said in a statement Saturday that the company “does not believe this incident poses a risk to public health or the environment.”

Federal officials are urging evacuees to stay where they are and not attempt to return home.

“Don’t feel a need to rush home to file a claim” said National Flood Insurance Program chief executive David Maurstad.

Coast Guard Adm. Meredith Austin said three major ports in the Carolinas remained closed, including the Cape Fear port near Wilmington. That closure is significant because the Cape Fear water utility has put out an urgent plea for fuel.

“Cape Fear is the number one priority of getting a port open,” she said. “We are aware of the need to get fuel into the port.”

FEMA associate administrator Jeff Byard provided the big picture: “This is a long event. We are definitely likely to have isolated communities.”

1 p.m.: ‘This storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now.’

North Carolina officials said floodwaters continue to rage and residents across nearly the entire state are in danger from torrential rainfall, rising rivers, floodwaters and, in the mountains, mudslides.

“This storm has never been more dangerous than it has right now,” in many areas of the state, Gov. Roy Cooper (D), said at a midday news conference. “Wherever you live in North Carolina, be on alert for sudden flooding.”

Cooper said numerous rivers throughout the state – including the Cape Fear, Lumber, Neuse – are still rising and not expected to crest until later Sunday or Monday. The storm has dumped nearly two feet of rain in many places, and some places are being pummeled with to three inches of rain an hour. Flooding is getting worse in parts of the state, including Pollocksville, Lumberton, Kinston and Goldsboro. The danger is growing in North Carolina’s western mountains, where rains could lead to dangerous mudslides.

Officials urged North Carolinians to stay off the roads. Many are closed; at least 171 primary roads are closed throughout the state, including portions of Interstates 95 and 40. People are urged not to drive east of Interstates 73/74 or U.S. Route 64 South. Many secondary roads are closed because of flooding.

Cooper estimated that between 750,000 and 1 million people have evacuated certain areas, a figure that will rise with expected mandatory evacuations in some places as rivers rise. About 15,000 people are staying in about 150 shelters across the state, he said. Four medical shelters are open in North Carolina, serving at least 170 patients.

More than 700,000 people remain without power and residents should expect to be without for days because so many roads are impassible.

“People need to understand that some areas are likely to be without power for a while,” Cooper said.

The governor said food, water and high-water vehicles are being delivered to hard-hit areas. The Coast Guard has rescued at least 50 people via helicopter.

11:57 a.m.: Officials say at least 14 dead as a result of Florence

Florence, which made landfall as a hurricane on Friday, is being cited for at least 14 deaths as of Sunday morning as its torrential rains continued to soak North and South Carolina, leading to widespread flooding during a slow march westward. State and local officials in the two states confirmed the deaths as being related to the impacts of the storm, which is expected to continue to flood large swaths of the region and pose considerable additional dangers to inland residents.

On Sunday, the South Carolina Emergency Management Division and office of Gov. Henry McMaster (R ) each confirmed four storm-related deaths. In Horry County, a 61-year-old woman and 63-year-old man died of carbon monoxide poisoning. A generator was located inside their home. A 61-year-old woman in Union County died when the vehicle she was driving struck a tree. And a 23-year-old man in Georgetown County died in a car crash.

On Saturday evening, the North Carolina Office of the Medical Examiner issued a news release saying that it had confirmed seven storm-related deaths, including a 41-year-old woman and her seven-month-old son who died in Wilmington on Friday when a tree fell on their home. The state also listed the deaths of a 78-year-old man in Lenoir County, who died when he was electrocuted; a 77-year-old man in Lenoir County who fell and died due to a cardiac problem while outside checking on dogs during the storm; an 81-year-old man in Wayne County who fell and struck his head while packing to evacuate; and a husband and wife who died in a house fire in Cumberland County.

Local officials have confirmed three additional deaths in North Carolina connected to the storm. The Duplin County Sheriff’s Office said two people died when flash flooding overwhelmed roads on Saturday; in Pender County, officials said that a woman died Friday morning when she was having a heart attack and emergency crews were unable to reach her in time due to downed trees and debris in the road.

11:28 a.m.: Officials expect storm impact to get worse in the coming days

Michael Sprayberry, North Carolina’s director of emergency management, said the impact of tropical depression Florence was “bad right now. And we do expect it to get worse over the coming days.”

Sprayberry said the state had more than 1,000 search and rescue personnel with more than 2,000 boats as well as 36 helicopters available for search and rescue operations.

“We know that’s going to be a major mission going forward, because this is historic and unprecedented flooding,” he said on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.” “This is one that’s for the record books,” Sprayberry said, adding that the recovery will be long-term.

“As you know, we’re actually still recovering from Hurricane Matthew in October of 2016, so it will be a massive, long term recovery,” Sprayberry said.

Local officials are receiving assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s urban search and rescue incident support team, which has more than 1,000 personnel deployed across Virginia and the Carolinas. That includes 16 water rescue packages – specially trained teams capable of saving people from swift-moving flash floods and the slow surge of rising rivers.

As of 10 p.m. Saturday, the team had conducted 22 rescues — efforts that involve technical skills, like removing people from sinking vehicles — and 451 evacuations. The teams had also evacuated 84 animals, mostly pets.

10:25 a.m.: It’s not the wind. It’s the water.

Lola Smith thought she’d be safe after the winds died down.

Smith, 69, and her neighbors at First Baptist Homes, an affordable-housing community for seniors and people with disabilities, had waited out the worst of Florence’s fury in the gymnasium of the high school in Lumberton, N.C., about 75 miles inland from the North Carolina coast where Florence made landfall on Friday.

But the shelter was cramped and uncomfortable: There were no showers or even hot water for sponge baths, and the narrow cots bothered her aging hips. “I just want to go home,” she said.

Her friends felt the same.

So on Saturday morning they packed up their belongings — blankets, Bibles, bags of insurance papers — and headed back to their apartments on the south side of town.

But the greater threat from Florence is not the winds, but the water. Torrential downpours soaked Lumberton’s streets and overwhelmed the surrounding marshes and canals. By Saturday evening, the Lumber River had swollen past flood stage and started to flood the city.

The water was creeping up to First Baptists residents’ doors when firefighters came by and told them they would have to leave. There was a mandatory evacuation for the whole southern part of Lumberton.

The fire officials turned off the water and gas, loaded the residents into vans and took them back to the high school.

They would be there until the river stopped rising. No one could say when that would be.

10:20 a.m.: Wilmington’s water utility needs fuel to keep working

Cape Fear Public Utility Authority said it is in desperate need of fuel for its generators so that it could continue to provide water to Wilmington, N.C.

“If we do not get the needed fuel within the next 24-hours, we will not be able to continue water service for public health and safety such as fire suppression and other life-sustaining activities at the hospital. Also, this hard-hit community will be without drinking water,” Peg Hall Williams, utility spokeswoman, said in an email.

Severe flooding has closed roads into Wilmington, making it nearly impossible to get resources into the coastal city by land.

9:54 a.m.: Florence’s unrelenting rain could bring “catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding risk”

The National Weather Service on Sunday warned of a “catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding risk” in much of North Carolina, northern South Carolina and southwest Virginia.

Although record-level rains and flooding are expected to ease along the North Carolina coast through the evening and overnight, more serious flooding is predicted to spread farther inland.

The floodwaters are expected to push many rivers to all-time highs and, toward the mountains of western North Carolina and southwestern Virginia, could spur life-threatening landslides.

“[A]reas of the North Carolina Piedmont and the mountainous terrain of western North Carolina will experience devastating flash flooding unlike anything in recent memory,” tweeted Greg Carbin, chief of the operations branch at the National Weather Service. “Roads and bridges will wash away and damage will be severe.”

5 a.m.: Florence downgraded to a depression

The National Hurricane Center announced at 5 a.m. Sunday that Florence had weakened to a tropical depression, but that it would keep dumping rain — another five to 10 inches in central and western North Carolina and southwest Virginia, leading to flash flooding, prolonged river flooding, and greater risk of landslides.

Another four to six inches could drop on southern North Carolina and the northern portion of South Carolina.

A few tornadoes remain possible in North Carolina and eastern South Carolina into Sunday night, they reported.

Some areas of southeastern North Carolina have gotten well over 20 inches of rain from Florence, according to the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center, and a few have been drenched with more than 30 inches.

4:10 a.m.: “Extremely hazardous” roads

As road conditions worsened overnight, state officials warned that travel was “extremely hazardous across North Carolina.”

Drivers were advised to avoid all roads south of U.S. 64 — which cuts across the state from Tennessee to the Outer Banks — and east of Interstate 73/74 — which runs north-south near Greensboro, N.C.

Interstate 40 was closed between Wilmington and Interstate 95, which cuts diagonally across the eastern third of the state.

State officials offered a map with a safer route, one that bypasses North Carolina entirely.

“This is an extremely long detour,” the North Carolina Department of Transportation special alert noted, “but it is the detour that offers the lowest risk of flooding at this time.”

With road conditions changing rapidly, officials advised travelers to check back frequently — especially because satellite navigation systems were still directing drivers to dangerous stretches of roadway.

Early Sunday morning, the National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C., posted on Twitter that there were 81 roads in Sampson County covered by high water, and several washouts.

Local agencies warned of trouble spots, and urged drivers to check with the state department of transportation.

The South Carolina Department of Transportation announced early Sunday that it would begin building barriers on Route 378 at two locations south of Florence, S.C., to protect the highway from floodwaters that would otherwise rise over bridges.

But most state roads had been cleared, other than a few power lines, by early Sunday morning, according to the agency.

2:45 a.m. In New Bern, N.C., a respite of brisket

The line of cars on Saturday snaked out onto the highway outside Smithfield’s Chicken ‘N Bar-B-Q in New Bern, N.C., one of the few restaurants open in the area after Tropical Storm Florence passed through. Post video journalists Ashleigh Joplin and Zoeann Murphy spoke to some of the hungry customers.

2:10 a.m.: Coal ash landfill collapses

Rain and storm water may have triggered erosion at a coal ash landfill at a power plant in Wilmington, N.C., Duke Energy announced Saturday evening.

About 2,000 cubic yards of ash — enough to fill two-thirds of an Olympic-sized swimming pool — appeared to be affected at the Sutton Power Plant. But the company was unable to determine how much water may have reached Sutton Lake, the cooling pond built for the plant. The plant is next to the Cape Fear River.

Disposal of the coal ash produced by power plants has been the subject of contentious debate nationally.

Duke Energy officials said in a news release that coal ash is nonhazardous and that there is no risk to public health or the environment. A spokesman for the company could not be reached for comment Saturday night.

The Southern Environmental Law Center had warned of the dangers of leaving coal ash in pits vulnerable to hurricanes and extreme weather. Frank Holleman, a lawyer for the center, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday night, but a spokeswoman for the center shared a recent statement he made: “Duke Energy has spent years lobbying and litigating and still has not removed the coal ash from its dangerous riverfront pits in the coastal area, some of which are in the flood plain.”

The ash at the Sutton Power Plant was in a lined pit, according to Duke Energy, and most of the displaced ash was collected in a perimeter ditch and haul road on the plant property.

Megan Thorpe, director of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, wrote in a statement Saturday night that the department has been “closely monitoring all coal ash impoundments that could be vulnerable in this record breaking rain event.”

As soon as it is safe to do so, she said, department officials will conduct a thorough inspection on site. Once the damage is assessed, the department will determine the best path forward, she wrote, “and hold the utility accountable for implementing the solution that ensures the protection of public health and the environment.”

Sheriff Martin Cuellar identified the man as 35-year-old Juan David Ortiz, a 10 year veteran supervisor of the U.S. Border Patrol. Ortiz was detained overnight and formally arrested and charged on Saturday afternoon.

All of these cases are related to the nearly two week murder investigation of two other women who were found killed in a rural part of Webb County.

On Saturday morning officials were dispatched to another part of the County where a third body was discovered. The fourth body was reported discovered just after 12 p.m. Saturday afternoon along I-35 just north of Laredo.

Another woman who is suspected to have been a fifth victim is said to have escaped from Ortiz and alerted authorities to him.

According to the District Attorney all of the women were prostitutes who were allegedly picked up by Ortiz. Officials say that as of now they do not believe that there are any other bodies that have yet to be discovered.

They also say that Ortiz was acting alone and no one else is suspected in these murders.

Ortiz has been charged with four counts of murder, unlawful restraint, and aggravated assault on a $2,500,000 bond.

Authorities are still investigating the case and will have more details as the story develops.","juan david ortiz

But Kavanaugh is not the only one feeling political heat. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who learned about the allegations in a letter from the woman dated July 30, is taking fire from Kavanaugh's GOP backers who see the controversy as a character smear and from progressives in her party who said the California senator sat on explosive accusations.

The episode has sent tensions between and inside both parties back to the boiling point over a nomination that could reshape the court for decades. Ill feeling was already deep after Democrats complained the GOP is rushing Kavanaugh through without proper scrutiny by withholding tens of thousands of documents.

The confirmation showdown has also offered key Democrats considering a run for President in 2020 an early forum, with California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker both winning points with liberal activists, even as they were accused of grandstanding by Republicans.

The accusations against Kavanaugh are being used by liberals to undercut the White House effort to present him as a family man and advocate of women and girls, in part to blunt Democratic accusations that he would vote to overturn the right to an abortion.

Kavanaugh, currently an appeals court judge in Washington, has categorically and unequivocally denied the accusations , and Republicans are furious that his opponents are openly debating them even in the absence of any evidence that they are true. The alleged incident, while Kavanaugh was in high school, was not investigated at the time and there is no sign that the woman reported it to police.

But the pivotal importance of the open Supreme Court seat means the controversy is only going to escalate ahead of an expected Judiciary Committee vote on the Kavanagh nomination next week.

Further fueling the debate, Anita Hill, the attorney who convulsed the 1991 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas with sexual assault allegations, issued a statement on Friday night.

""The reluctance of someone to come forward demonstrates that even in the #MeToo era, it remains incredibly difficult to report harassment, abuse or assault by people in power,"" Hill said.

""The Senate Judiciary Committee should put in place a process that enables anyone with a complaint of this nature to be heard. I have seen firsthand what happens when such a process is weaponized against an accuser, and no one should have to endure that again.""

At this stage, there is no indication that Kavanaugh's nomination is under threat, owing to the GOP Senate majority and the huge incentive for Republicans to cement a conservative majority on the nation's top bench.

The woman who made the allegations declined to come forward publicly after making them in a letter that was passed to Feinstein. Advocates say her anonymity should be respected, that she deserves to be heard and the claims must be investigated.

But absent new developments, perhaps on the scale of an on the record, public accusation against Kavanaugh, it is hard to see Republican senators bowing to Democratic pressure to act. Democrats could call for new public or private sessions in the Judiciary Committee to address the allegations. But all of their efforts to shape the confirmation process have been rebuffed by Republicans.

As soon as whispers of the allegations became public on Thursday, the White House accused Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of using them as an 11th hour delaying tactic to try to slow Kavanaugh's confirmation -- and noted that Feinstein has not previously raised the issue in public.

On Friday, as more and more media outlets reported the allegations, the office of Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley released an 11-point statement that was unusually personal in its criticism of Feinstein.

It said that the California senator failed to attend a closed-door session of the committee where sensitive material was discussed, and in which the letter was not referenced.

Grassley's office also sent around a letter signed by 65 women who have known the nominee for 35 years that says that at all times he has ""behaved honorably and treated women with respect.""

Another key Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah complained the accusations were unverified and said the judge had submitted to six FBI background checks over the last 25 years that included interviews with families, friends and acquaintances and never revealed any character issues.

""I do not intend to allow Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to be stalled because of an 11th hour accusation that Democrats did not see fit to raise for over a month,"" Hatch said in a statement.

Politically, the only threat to Kavanaugh's confirmation appears to lie in the votes of two Republicans, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who have been under fierce pressure from pro-choice advocates to reject him, since he is seen as likely to support cases that could overturn the right to an abortion.

Kavanaugh went ahead with a planned call with Collins that lasted an hour on Friday. The Maine senator's staff declined to give any details of the conversation.

Should the controversy escalate, it could also change the political terrain for red-state Democrats who are under pressure from the party's liberal base to reject Kavanaugh and from their own conservative voters to vote to confirm him.

The political ramifications of the allegations were not confined to questions about Kavanaugh.

Feinstein was left facing an unwelcome new assault from her progressive challenger in California's jungle primary system, state Sen. Kevin de León, who has been framing her as Washington veteran who has lost touch with her voters.

He demanded to know why Feinstein had ""waited nearly three months"" to hand over the letter to federal authorities and why she had ""politely pantomimed her way"" through confirmation hearings with no mention of it.

Questions about why Feinstein did not act on information that at the very least could be a seen as a way to slow or disrupt Kavanaugh's nomination are also puzzling Capitol Hill Democrats.

Feinstein's staff tried to stall the fast-building political controversy on Friday afternoon.

A spokesman for the California senator said she took the allegations seriously and thought they should be made public but was constrained by the accuser's wish to remain anonymous.

""It is critical in matters of sexual misconduct to protect the identity of the victim when they wish to remain anonymous, and the senator did so in this case.""

The furor over the letter has exposed the awkward spot that Feinstein has faced in the Kavanaugh nomination. In the hearings, she posed pointed legal questions to the nominee on issues such as his attitude towards abortion and interrogations of terror suspects during the Bush administration.

But her interventions lacked the partisan energy of senators like Booker and Harris.

Progressive groups were quick to respond to the allegations about Kavanaugh. The ""Rise up for Roe"" group of activists said he should ""immediately withdraw from consideration.""

The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said the allegation should be taken seriously while respecting the privacy of the woman who made the allegations.

""Once cast, senators cannot take back their vote. They need to be sure they have Kavanaugh's full record before they proceed on his nomination to the Supreme Court,"" the group's President and CEO, Vanita Gupta, said.","judiciary committee sen orrin hatch of utah

At a Glance At least 64 killed, 45 injured by Typhoon Mangkhut in the Philippines

At least 2 dead, 15 injured by Typhoon Mangkhut in China, Macau

More than 2.4 million people have been evacuated from high-risk areas.

Mangkhut struck the Philippines as a Category 5 early Saturday.

Fifteen foot storm surge has been reported in Hong Kong due to Typhoon Mangkhut, which is likely to make it the most damaging typhoon in Asian history, according to official records.

After leaving 64 dead and infrastructure destroyed in the Northern Philippines, Typhoon Mangkhut barreled into southern China on Sunday, bringing with it strong winds and heavy rain, prompting Chinese authorities to issue a red alert, the country’s most severe storm warning. Fifteen foot storm surge has been reported in Hong Kong due to Typhoon Mangkhut, which is likely to make it the most damaging typhoon in Asian history, according to official records.

More than 2.4 million people had been evacuated in southern China’s Guangdong province by Sunday evening to flee the massive typhoon and nearly 50,000 fishing boats were called back to port, state media reported. It threatens to be the strongest typhoon to hit Hong Kong in nearly two decades. The Hong Kong Observatory issued its strongest storm warning for 10 hours on Sunday, just slightly shorter than the record time of 11 hours set by Typhoon York in 1999, the South China Morning Post reported.

“Prepare for the worst,” Hong Kong Security Minister John Lee Ka-chiu urged residents.

That warning came after Mangkhut’s devastating march through the northern Philippines, where the storm made landfall Saturday on Luzon island with sustained winds of 127 miles per hour and gusts of 158 mph.

Police Superintendent Pelita Tacio said 34 villagers had died and 36 remained missing in landslides in two villages in Itogon town in the northern Philippine mountain province of Benguet.

Itogon Mayor Victorio Palangdan told The Associated Press by phone that at the height of the typhoon’s onslaught Saturday afternoon, dozens of people, mostly miners and their families, rushed into an old three-story building in the village of Ucab.

The building — a former mining bunkhouse that had been transformed into a chapel — was obliterated when part of a mountain slope collapsed. Three villagers who managed to escape told authorities what happened.

“They thought they were really safe there,” the mayor said. He expressed sadness that the villagers, many of them poor, had few options to survive in a region where big corporations have profited immensely from gold mines.

Rescuers were scrambling to pull out the body of a victim from the mound of mud and rocks in Ucab before Tacio, the police official, left the area Sunday.

“I could hear villagers wailing in their homes near the site of the accident,” Tacio said.

As Mangkhut spun forward, Hong Kong braced for a storm that could be the strongest to hit the city since Typhoon York in 1999.

A video posted online by residents showed the top corner of an old building break and fall off, while in another video, a tall building swayed as strong winds blew.

The storm shattered glass windows on commercial skyscrapers in Hong Kong, sending sheets of paper pouring out of the buildings, fluttering and spiraling as they headed for the debris-strewn ground, according to several videos posted on social media.

Mangkhut also felled trees, tore bamboo scaffolding off buildings under construction and flooded some areas of Hong Kong with waist-high waters, according to the South China Morning Post.

The paper said the heavy rains brought storm surges of 10 feet around Hong Kong.

The storm made landfall in the Guangdong city of Taishan at 5 p.m., packing wind speeds of 100 miles per hour. State television broadcaster CGTN reported that surging waves flooded a seaside hotel in the city of Shenzhen.

In Macau, next door to Hong Kong, casinos were ordered to close from 11 p.m. Saturday, the first time such action was taken in the city, the South China Morning Post reported. In the city’s inner harbor district, the water level reached 5 feet on Sunday and was expected to rise further. The area was one of the most affected by floods from Typhoon Hato, which left 10 people dead last year.

(MORE: Mangkhut's Next Move )

Authorities in southern China issued a red alert, the most severe warning, as the national meteorological center said the densely populated region would face a “severe test caused by wind and rain” and urged officials to prepare for possible disasters.

Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific said all of its flights would be canceled between 2:30 a.m. Sunday and 4 a.m. Monday. The city of Shenzhen also canceled all flights between Sunday and early Monday morning. Hainan Airlines canceled 234 flights in the cities of Haikou, Sanya, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai scheduled over the weekend.

All high-speed and some normal rail services in Guangdong and Hainan provinces were also halted, the China Railway Guangzhou Group Co. said.

In the Philippines, rescuers for the Itogon landslide were hampered by rain and mud. The search and rescue operation was suspended at nightfall and was to resume at daybreak Monday, said Palangdan, the mayor. Police and their vehicles could not immediately reach the landslide-hit area because the ground was unstable and soaked from the heavy rains, regional police chief Rolando Nana told the ABS-CBN TV network.

Overall, at least 64 people have died in typhoon-related incidents in the northern Philippines, mostly from landslides and collapsed houses, according to the national police. Forty-five other people were missing and 33 were injured in the storm.

The hardest-hit area was Benguet province, where 38 people died, mostly in the two landslides in Itogon, and 37 are missing, the police said.

Still, the Philippines appeared to have been spared the high number of casualties many had feared. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened villages and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines. A massive evacuation of about 87,000 people from high-risk areas helped lessen potential casualties, officials said.

The typhoon struck at the start of the rice and corn harvesting season in the Philippines’ northern breadbasket, prompting farmers to scramble to save what they could of their crops, Cagayan Gov. Manuel Mamba said.

China and the Philippines agreed to postpone a visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that was to start Sunday due to the onslaught, which caused nearly 150 flights, a third of them international, to be canceled and halted sea travel.","haikou sanya guangzhou shenzhen

The move comes as an effort to “streamline” the social studies curriculum in the state, The Dallas Morning News first reported.

The vote, which was preliminary, came after a 15-member, board-nominated volunteer work group created a scale to grade historical figures, determining which were “essential to learn about and who wasn’t,” The Dallas Morning News reported. To determine their choices, the group asked a series of questions about the historical figures' background and legacy.

EVERGREEN STATE APOLOGIZES FOR USING TAXPAYER FUNDS TO PROTEST FAMILY FARM

Clinton scored a 5 on the 20-point scale, while another figure who was also designated for removal, Hellen Keller, earned a 7.

Keller, who was blind and deaf, was known for her political activism, among other accomplishments.

“Eliminating Clinton from the requirements will save teachers 30 minutes of instructional time, the work group estimated, and eliminating Keller will save 40 minutes,” the newspaper reported.

On the other hand, several historical Texas figures -- such as Barbara Jordan, Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin and Henry B. González, among others -- received a perfect score.

""Our task was to simplify. ... We tried to make it as objective as possible,” Misty Matthews, a teacher in Round Rock, Texas, told the publication, which added that high school students in the state were previously required to learn about Clinton, a former first lady and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. Third-graders were required to learn about Keller.

In addition, the board voted to add Billy Graham -- the famed evangelist who died earlier this year -- back into the curriculum.

What’s more, “the board also voted to add back into the curriculum a reference to the ""heroism"" of the defenders of the Alamo (something that had been recommended for removal), as well as Moses' influence on the writing of the founding documents, multiple references to ""Judeo-Christian"" values and a requirement that students explain how the ""Arab rejection of the State of Israel has led to ongoing conflict"" in the Middle East,” the newspaper reported.

TEXAS BIOLOGY TEACHER ON LEAVE FOR ALLEGEDLY BULLYING PRO-TRUMP STUDENT

While Clinton, Keller and other figures were eliminated, that does not mean teachers in the state are prohibited from offering lessons about them; rather, they are not required to do so.

The board will vote again in November to finalize the changes. Amendments to the curriculum can be made before that time.","barbara jordan sam houston stephen

Two mummified ice age mammals – a wolf pup and a caribou calf – were discovered by gold miners in the area in 2016 and unveiled on Thursday at a ceremony in Dawson in Yukon territory.

It is extremely rare for fur, skin and muscle tissues to be preserved in the fossil record, but all three are present on these specimens, which have been radiocarbon-dated to more than 50,000 years old.

The wolf pup is preserved in its entirety, including exceptional details of the head, tail, paws, skin and hair. The caribou calf is partially preserved, with head, torso and two front limbs intact.

“To our knowledge, this is the only mummified ice age wolf ever found in the world,” said Grant Zazula, a local palaeontologist working with the Yukon government, who also emphasised the support of the local gold miners and mining community for palaeontology research.

Julie Meachen, a carnivore morphologist who works with ice age mammals at Des Moines University and will soon be doing research on the wolf pup, said: “When Grant sent me the pictures and asked me to participate I was really, really excited. I was sort of beside myself.

“We want to do an ancient DNA test to see who it’s related to and look at its microbiome to see if there are gut bacteria still there.”

The head of the mummified wolf pup is remarkably well preserved. Photograph: Government of Yukon

Other researchers around the world reacted with similar excitement to the discovery of this ancient predator and its prey, which are well enough preserved to allow for future investigation of factors such as cause of death, diet, health, age and genetics.

Elsa Panciroli, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Ice age wolf bones are relatively common in the Yukon, but having an animal preserved with skin and fur is just exceptional – you just want to reach out and stroke it. It’s an evocative glimpse into the ice age world.”

Thomas Higham, an expert in archaeological dating at the University of Oxford, said: “The remains are highly evocative because they enable us to make almost face-to-face connection with animals that are tens of thousands of years old, and yet look much more recent.”

The wolf and caribou are believed to have inhabited a dry tundra landscape alongside other animals such as woolly mammoths.

The preservation of the skin and fur suggests they were living in a cold period, said Jan Zalasiewicz, a palaeobiologist at the University of Leicester. “A drier and more arid climate would help to preserve skin and fur, and this typically happens when the climate gets colder,” he said. “The trick here is finding a means of freeze-drying the carcass in these arid conditions and burying it … you need to find a way to dry it and put it in the freezer very quickly.”

Panciroli said: “Hopefully further research on this ‘pup-sicle’ might yield some ancient DNA” that could provide new information about the wolf populations that lived in the Yukon at this time. “For example, where did they come from, and how are they related to modern wolves?”","university of edinburgh

You can listen to the episode here or at kpknudson.com, where there is also a transcript.

Arizona State University applied mathematician Erika Camacho. Credit: Erika Camacho

Dr. Camacho was inspired to go into applied mathematics when she did a summer research project modeling HIV as an undergraduate. (You can hear more about that in the interview I did with her for the Lathisms podcast series, which features conversations with Hispanic and Latinx mathematicians.) Since deciding to go into applied math, she has studied a few different topics, including the dynamics of how fanaticism spreads in communities and mathematical modeling of the eye. Currently one of her main research projects is on retinitis pigmentosa, which can cause blindness.

There’s one theorem Dr. Camacho says has been a steady companion in her work: the Hartman-Grobman theorem. This theorem is useful for understanding systems that are nonlinear. In mathematics, nonlinear basically means “hard to analyze;” linear systems respond proportionally to changes in variables, whereas nonlinear systems have more complicated relationships. A key way to understand nonlinear systems is to figure out where and when they can be well-approximated by linear systems. The Hartman-Grobman theorem does just that. As Dr. Camacho describes, this theorem applies to systems that have a certain type of equilibrium, or steady state. The theorem states that under certain conditions, those systems can be well-described by linear systems near the equilibrium point. And there is much rejoicing.

In each episode of the podcast, we ask our guest to pair their theorem with something: food, beverage, art, music, or some other delight in life. For this addictive, layered theorem, Dr. Camacho chose a special dessert. You’ll have to listen to the episode to hear why Tennessee whiskey cake is the perfect accompaniment to the Hartman-Grobman theorem.

Rather than pushing off the ground with their legs, pterosaurs used their arms in a pole-vault type of motion to launch themselves skyward. Interesting stuff, but I quickly became irritated by some of the popular coverage of the new research.

Whenever a story about pterosaurs makes it into mainstream news outlets, it is almost inevitable the flying archosaurs are going to be mistakenly called ""dinosaurs"" by at least one source. In this case the British newspaper the Telegraph and the venerable BBC were two of the main offenders, each declaring that pterosaurs were dinosaurs in their headlines.

It might be easy to brush off my complaint as a case of paleo-pedantry, but word choice matters. ""Dinosaur"" is a word for a specific group of creatures united by shared characteristics and which had their own evolutionary history—it is not a catch-all term for anything reptilian and prehistoric. Calling a pterosaur a dinosaur is an error of the same order of magnitude as saying that our species is a marsupial, but to understand why we need to flesh out the evolutionary relationships of these animals.

Let's start from the bottom and work our way up. The Archosauria is a diverse group of reptiles which contains two major subsections: crocodiles and their close relatives (collectively called crurotarsans or pseudosuchians) are on one side of the split, and dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and their closest relatives (called avemetatarsalians) on the other. For our purposes here, we're concerned with the second group.

Looking at the Avemetatarsalia (see the diagram above), a major split is apparent at the base of this group. On the one side are the dinosaurs and their closest relatives, and on the other are pterosaurs and animals more closely related to them than dinosaurs. Both pterosaurs and dinosaurs are distinct groups that shared a common ancestor, and so to call a pterosaur a dinosaur is to ignore this major divergence in the evolution of both groups. A pterosaur is no more a dinosaur than a goldfish is a shark.

There is no reason for news sources to keep applying the word ""dinosaur"" to pterosaurs. We have known about this distinction for a long time, and I bet that your average 10-year old paleo fan would know not confuse the groups. With even just a tiny bit of an evolutionary perspective, the distinction becomes clear.

To learn more about pterosaurs, visit Pterosaur.net, which was recently created by a team of pterosaur experts including Witton and Habib.","pterosaurs—particularly

Video Game Art Books and Guides at Amazon

Another roundup of video game related books are on sale over at Amazon and this time they are all upcoming books currently available for preorder.

One of the best things about new Apple product releases is that the previous generation gets a hefty discount. The Apple Series 3 sold for $359 just last week, and now it's available from $279. Features include an aluminum case that's waterproof up to 50 meters, built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and much more. If you don't need the ECG or other medical capabilities of the Series 4, you could save alot of money by going just one generation back.

This deal is even better than the one on Amazon Prime Day. You can get access to over 1 million Kindle eBooks and over 20,000 digital comics for 3 months with no commitment. New subscribers only.

These gaming desktops are housed with the latest and greatest video cards (even the GTX 2080 should offer better performance than the GTX 1080 Ti). They're finally available for preorder and will ship out next week with an estimated September 22 arrival. Walmart offers an extended 3-year warranty for $58 right on the product page, as well as free shipping and easy in-store returns (if necessary).

Rarely do you find a GeForce GTX 1070 Ti equipped pre-built desktop priced under $1K.

Extend your warranty to 3 years for $58.

This is the lowest price we've seen for this officially licensed Hasbro toy (normally $39.99). R2-D2 features app-controlled movement, and can play and dance to music.

This model (MR6Y2LL/A) has both Wi-Fi and cellular networking and currently sells for $459 elsewhere, including the Apple Store. The newest generation supports the Apple Pencil, much like the pricier iPad Pro.

Look, Avatar: The Last Airbender is not a show to pass up on and the complete collection contains a beautiful and heartfelt 61 episodes. This is the lowest price since it was released in June. Walmart and Amazon have different art for the Blu-ray covers.

This game is now availabe at an introductory price of $17.99, but it will eventually climb its way back up to $29.99.

With an i7-8700K and a GeForce GTX 1080, what more do you need?

Overwatch still sells for at least $30 elsewhere, and the lowest price I'd previously seen for the PC version was $19.99. Overwatch was awarded IGN's Game of the Year back in 2016. To sweeten the deal, Humble isn't just giving you Overwatch for $12. You'll also get more games to play about a month later when this bundle promotion ends.

Note: Technically this is called a ""subscription"" but you can just buy this bundle without buying any subsequent ones.

These TVs come with a 90-day return policy, and since it is Walmart, you can always return the TV at a physical location if you need to. If you want to be extra safe, you can purchase an extended 3-year warranty plan for only $58. OLEDs are considered to be the king of HDTVs. They offer phenomenal contrast ratio, best-in-class black levels, and HDR.

These officially licensed vintage Transformers toys are crazy popular and out of stock 99% of the time. As far as authenticity is concerned, the G1 Transformers reissues were made using ""the original production tooling including die-cast parts and classic heat-sensitive stickers.""

With WWE's annual Hell in a Cell PPV event just days out, on Sunday the 16th, and this year also marking the 20th anniversary of the time Mick Foley nearly killed himself for our adoration, it's the perfect time to rank some horrifying Hell in the Cell matches.

This year, inside the Cell, Roman Reigns will defend the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman while Jeff Hardy will attempt to get some measure of revenge against Randy Orton (even though the SmackDown Cell match should be Charlotte Flair vs. Becky Lynch). Will either of these two encounters become an instant classic? Enough to bump one of the following matches off the slideshow list?

Check out the countdown below, marking the 15 best Hell in a Cell encounters. Most of which, unsurprisingly, feature The Undertaker. Even his last Cell match, from 2015, made the cut. But hey! - Triple H is in a bunch too so he's no slouch when it comes to unleashing Hell inside said Cell.

The upcoming Venom film has been confirmed to have a running time of 1 hour and 52 minutes, and has been rated PG-13 by the MPAA.

As reported by Collider (and verified by AMC), the nearly two-hour long film will not be rated R, despite hopes fans had that it would follow in Deadpool and Logan’s footsteps.

Exit Theatre Mode

Though perhaps disappointing for some, this news has been expected for some time. Sony had been pushing for a PG-13 rating from the beginning, even if Venom's director and lead actor weren’t so sure. Reports claimed Sony wanted to push the content in the movie right up to the edge of an R-rating without actually getting into the 17-and-over age bracket.

There has been a lot of news surrounding Venom lately, including Eminem providing the title track of the film, going so far as to include it on his most recent surprise album.

Throughout September, IGN is spotlighting the best TV coming your way in the 2018-2019 season. Today, we're taking a look at DC Universe's Titans, premiering October 12 on the new subscription service. This fresh take on the iconic DC Comics team unites Starfire (Anna Diop), Raven (Teagan Croft), Beast Boy (Ryan Potter), and Dick Grayson's Robin (Brenton Thwaites), as they become embroiled in a conspiracy that could bring about Hell on Earth.

Batman and Robin have one of the most iconic partnerships in pop culture history, but what happens when one half of the dynamic duo wants to fly solo?

Exit Theatre Mode

DC Universe's Titans sees the original Robin, Dick Grayson, trying to escape the Shadow of the Bat and strike out on his own, and judging by the trailer that was released at Comic-Con (and one particularly memorable line that Dick mutters about his mentor), it's safe to assume that things are a little strained between the Boy Wonder and the Dark Knight when the series kicks off.

And that rift is likely to widen once Dick comes face to face with his replacement, Jason Todd (Curran Walters), who IGN can exclusively reveal in costume in our first look images below.

This is Jason's first live-action appearance (and thus Dick and Jason's first live-action encounter) in any DC property, which is a pretty momentous development for fans of the Bat-Family; and if their body language is any indication, this isn't a particularly friendly meeting. (Which isn't surprising, since it looks like - just as in the comics - Batman has given his second Robin a pretty much identical costume to his prodigal son's. Ouch.)

IGN caught up with Titans showrunner Greg Walker for some insight into the relationship between the dueling Robins when they eventually come face to face.

""What I really love about [Jason] as a character is the unbridled sense of self that he has - there’s a lack of... maybe self-awareness, but for sure self-consciousness in terms of how he comports himself and how he moves through the world,"" Walker explained. ""He’s completely seemingly unaffected by darkness - he kind of embraces it or walks right through it. He’s a breath of fresh air and that’s what I love about him, he’s got a punk rock, no-holds-barred attitude that’s massively unburdened. There’s a lot of energy that comes with that.""

For Dick, that attitude probably adds insult to injury, which may be what contributes to the apparent antagonism between the two in our photos. ""It’s kind of like one of those classic covers of the books, original versus number 2, and in many ways, you really see that [in the photos]. This encapsulates the tension, the energy between these two guys. It's like running into your ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, minus the sexual tension,"" Walker laughed. ""You get to watch Dick Grayson struggle when he sees another Robin and how that Robin is different and has a different relationship with 'dad.' And the second child gets away with stuff the first child would never get away with in a family, and ours is really a family show.""

Rest assured, you can expect to see both Robins in action on Titans, which will emphasize the differences between Dick and Jason - and how each of them relates to Bruce. ""The whole thing is a study in contrasts between the two Robins and the the ways that they were raised, or how the shadow - or lack of shadow - hangs over the two of them individually,"" Walker teased. ""It’s so frustrating to see someone who isn’t bothered by someone else the way you are... like, 'how are you not bothered by that? Why doesn’t that screw you up?' There’s something confusing and challenging and unsettling about that for Dick.""

But how did Dick get to this place of estrangement from Bruce in the first place? In several iterations of their split, Batman unceremoniously fired his sidekick, but it sounds as if Titans will make Dick's distance more self-imposed. ""Dick Grayson is in exile, trying to figure out who Dick Grayson is and who Robin is, and how both of them or either of them or neither of them relate to Batman,"" Walker said. ""In many ways, like a lot of us have to deal with branching out on our own to set the course towards adulthood, he’s dealing with that and trying to understand the darkness that came with him - is it nature or nurture? Is it due to the horrible circumstances that drew him to be Bruce Wayne’s ward, or is it because of the actual raising and upbringing? So a lot of the story’s about that, and a lot of the trajectory of the character has to do with that struggle.""

As for whether we'll ever see the Caped Crusader in the flesh on Titans, Walker would only say, ""Bruce looms large in our show - both Bruce and Batman, if you want to separate them, and the show does to some degree. We’re not a Batman show, and that’s for a number of reasons, but I think we definitely want to show the relationship between Bruce and Dick just simply as an origin story. If the show does anything, it sets up Dick’s thesis about who Bruce/Batman is and then attempts to question it along the way... Just as you or I might have a version of our parents and somebody comes along, a spouse or a friend, and says, 'from the outside, I’m not so sure you’re right,' we want to function that way too.""

Exit Theatre Mode

And while some fans may have been shocked to see Dick's aggression during the fight scenes in the Titans trailer (which was always more of a Jason trait), Walker promised that the show will stay true to his character as he struggles to reconcile who he is as a hero without Batman.

""There’s only so much internal pressure a character can hold before he or she has to release, and he’s a kid dealing with trauma and grief and issues that need to have an external release, otherwise you’re having the kind of mopey, dark antihero that I certainly, as an audience member, have seen a lot of and am tired of,"" Walker explained. ""I think we push the limits of where you go with that character, but he still plays by the same rules that Robin has played by in the past, which is that it’s justice-related. [It] certainly at times edges towards irrational and unexamined, but it’s an expression of that side of his struggle, the darkness inside him he’s trying to figure out how to deal with, and to not show it would be pulling punches and would be disingenuous.""

Henry Cavill posted a cryptic video on his Instagram Wednesday evening following the multiple reports of he and Warner Bros. parting ways for any future Superman installments or cameos.

The video on Cavill's Instagram shows him in front of the camera wearing a shirt that reads ""Krypton Lifting Team"" with music in the background while he slowly lifts up a Superman figure to the beat of the music, and then lowers it back down as the video ends.

The text accompanied in his post read, ""Today was exciting"" with the hashtag #Superman at the end.

It is unclear of exactly what Cavill is trying to communicate in the video. It could be that he's responding to the reports that no, he's not done playing Superman yet and his contract will continue – or he could be conveying that he is in fact finished with the role.

In a statement earlier Wednesday to THR, Warner Bros. said: ""While no decisions have been made regarding any upcoming Superman films, we’ve always had great respect for and a great relationship with Henry Cavill, and that remains unchanged.""

With word coming today that Warner Bros. and Henry Cavill have parted ways and Cavill will no longer be playing Superman in the DC films, the studio’s superhero slate has suffered another blow. But unfortunately, despite the fact that Superman has always been one of DC Comics’ marquee characters (alongside Batman, who by the way is reportedly on the verge of being recast), this is just the latest example of Warners indicating that they don’t know what to do with the Man of Steel.

(Meanwhile, Cavill's manager Dany Garcia said on Twitter this morning that ""the cape is still in his closet,"" confusingly implying that perhaps the actor isn't totally out of the Superman game yet despite today's news. And Warner Bros. responded to the report from THR with the following statement: ""While no decisions have been made regarding any upcoming Superman films, we’ve always had great respect for and a great relationship with Henry Cavill, and that remains unchanged."")

Exit Theatre Mode

The studio has been fumbling the character at least since 2006 when Bryan Singer’s Superman Returns was meant to reintroduce Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman to modern moviegoers. The film, while not bad, played largely like an homage to the Christopher Reeve Superman of yesteryear rather than a fresh take on the character. Singer did attempt to spin out a couple of new ideas, such as Superman’s secret son with Lois Lane, but the film’s reception wasn’t strong enough to merit a sequel, and any further fleshing out of those concepts died on the vine.

From there, the studio mostly chose to move away from Superman and lean into the Christopher Nolan Batman movies, but once that trilogy ended in 2012, the opportunity arose to build a new universe based on the iconic DC characters. Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel was the first of these films, where Cavill made his debut as a young, untried Superman. It’s an interesting movie in many ways, playing up the difficulties of Kal-El’s life growing up, but Snyder chose to take Superman into the “dark and gritty” realm that has since become the trademark of the DCEU. It’s a point of great contention for fans, but Kal-El’s killing General Zod at the film’s climax, as well as his participation in the destruction of a large swath of Metropolis without, apparently, giving its vulnerable citizens a second thought, was seen by many as a misstep in terms of the general nature of Superman. What happened to the guy who saves cats that are stuck in trees?

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice followed suit, with Snyder and the studio seemingly deciding that the best thing they could do with Superman in what was, after all, only his second movie, was to kill him off. It’s hard to say exactly what Snyder’s original plan for the character was in Justice League, the team-up film that followed -- would the resurrected Superman have been the villain of the piece, as BvS seems to hint?! -- but the notorious difficulties that production faced likely mean we’ll never truly know. Ironically, by the time Avengers director Joss Whedon came in to rewrite and reshoot parts of Justice League, the more likable, jovial version of the character that resulted -- and that seemed closer to the classic concept of Superman -- was apparently too little, too late, and Cavill is now said to be done with the role.

Superman was, for a very, very long time, the superhero for not just DC, but the world. Recognizable across the globe for decades, he was essentially the first superhero, but Warner Bros. hasn’t been able to figure out how to successfully translate him to the big screen essentially since Superman II back in 1980! One hesitates to compare the DCEU to the MCU for fear of stoking the Great Fanboy Wars of the early 21st century, but consider the second- and third-tier characters Marvel has adapted to the movies to great success.

Exit Theatre Mode

That’s why as crazy as it is to think that Warners is taking a break from Superman for the next few years (reportedly choosing instead to focus on Supergirl), it’s actually not that surprising given their track record. Much has been made about the challenges of making the Big Blue Boy Scout relevant for modern audiences who aren’t so quick to buy into the whole “truth, justice and the American way” thing, and it seems that, for now anyway, Warners is choosing to just not try. (WBTV, on the other hand, has sparingly presented their take on Superman in the Arrowverse, hitting much closer to the “boy scout” mark than the Cavill films, even while choosing to focus on Supergirl -- the same path the film universe is about to take.)

Also, one must consider the current slate of planned DCEU films at the studio. There’s a definite movement towards lesser known characters, villains and female characters, no doubt a reaction to the success (critically, financially, or pop culture-wise) of players like Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn. How does Superman fit into a Batgirl movie, or a Joker standalone, or Birds of Prey anyway?

Exit Theatre Mode

But with Cavill apparently out, and Ben Affleck rumored to also be ready to hang up the cape and cowl, Warners and the folks behind the DC films are presented with an opportunity to soft-reboot the series. Obviously Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman isn’t going anywhere -- she’s the best thing the DCEU has going -- but depending on how Jason Momoa’s Aquaman pans out this fall, the rest of the Justice League could also be disappearing to the Watchtower for good. While the Flash’s solo movie is reportedly going into production in the spring, it’s not out of the question that Aquaman’s reception could affect that project’s status. Meanwhile, the buzz is good on Shazam! out of Comic-Con, so the timing to kinda/sorta reboot makes a lot of sense right now.

As for that talk of Michael B. Jordan taking over as Superman in a couple of years, that’s the Hollywood equivalent of how long it took baby Kal-El’s ship to reach Earth from Krypton, so don’t hold your breath. (He hasn’t even been offered the role as far as we know, so the biggest takeaway here is that the studio does want to bring the character back with a new actor at some point.) And besides, the way Warners/DC have been operating with these films so far hasn’t exactly been consistent, so the game plan could all change again six months from now. No matter who winds up playing Superman next, however, one thing is clear. It’s time Warner Bros. figures out how to do right by the character again.

Camera improvements are par for the course with each new iPhone, and the iPhone XS is no exception. Apple showed off improvements to its camera system, including adjustable depth-of-field in portrait mode. It also added portrait mode to the XR, in spite of the fact it has only one rear-facing camera.

All are liquid resistant, with Apple testing them against several types of water, as well as orange juice and beer.

The XS and XR run on Apple's 7nm A12 Bionic chip, with a 4-core GPU and 6-core CPU with up to 15% more power. The new chip has greater secondary memory capabilities, allowing the new iPhones to come in sizes up to 512GB.

Earlier today, details on the new iPhones, including storage capacity and color selections, were leaked on Apple's own website by XML data.

The superhuman mob enforcer known as Tombstone has made life tough for Spider-Man for decades. While a recurring player in the Spider-Man comics for the past 30 years, Tombstone isn't necessarily the most well-known member of Spidey's rogues gallery. But he is one of the scarier villains Peter Parker has faced.

Here's everything you need to know about the ruthless villain known as Tombstone.

Tombstone Explained: The Basics

With all the colorful characters vying for control of New York's criminal underworld in the Marvel Universe, it takes a special breed of gangster to stay competitive. That's never been an issue for Lonnie Lincoln. A rough upbringing molded him into one of the most feared killers in the city, one who more than justifies the nickname ""Tombstone."" Even the most powerful crime lords in New York like Kingpin and The Hood recognize Tombstone's talent for getting the job done and sending his enemies cowering into the night. After all, it takes a special breed of fighter to go up against the Amazing Spider-Man and walk away unscathed.

Tombstone's Powers and Abilities

Originally, Tombstone had no superhuman abilities to speak of. His mean temperament comes from the fact that he was the only albino African American growing up in his Harlem neighborhood. A childhood of bullying and abuse molded him into a hardened street fighter, one who's never afraid to take a life when the opportunity arises. Tombstone added to his personal mystique by filing his teeth and fingernails into razor-sharp points and enhancing his burly frame with a strict bodybuilding regimen.

Eventually, however, Tombstone did gain powers after being exposed to an experimental gas. He now has enhanced strength, speed and durability, putting him on equal footing with heroes like Spider-Man and Daredevil.

Tombstone: Origin and Background

Tombstone was one of several major new additions to Spider-Man's rogues gallery in the late '80s, alongside the likes of Venom and one of the many new incarnations of Hobgoblin. With so many monthly Spider-Man comics on the stands, Marvel creators needed all the fresh blood they could find.

Tombstone was created by writer Gerry Conway and artist Alex Saviuk and debuted in 1988's Web of Spider-Man #36. Early issues established Lonnie Lincoln's tragic backstory and his connection to Daily Bugle editor Robbie Robertson. Readers learned that Robbie once witnessed Tombstone beating a source to death. Robertson kept that incident a secret for several decades, fearing for his own life. This made Tombstone somewhat unique among Spider-Man villains in that his feud wasn't with Spidey himself so much as one of his close allies.

That feud continued until the day Robertson shot his old nemesis and left him to die in a test chamber inside an Oscorp facility. Instead, exposure to an experimental gas granted Tombstone super-powers, making him suddenly grateful to his old enemy. That's one way to patch up a relationship.

Ever since then, Tombstone has remained a major thorn in the side of heroes like Spider-Man, Daredevil and even Deadpool. He also came into conflict with police captain Yuri Watanabe, who masquerades as a vigilante known as The Wraith. Watanabe made it her mission to bring down Tombstone and a corrupt judge who helped him stay out of prison.

Tombstone also played a major role in a 2013 series called The Superior Foes of Spider-Man. There it was revealed that the new Beetle, a woman named Janice Lincoln, is actually Tombstone's daughter. Apparently super-crime runs in the family.

Tombstone: Beyond the Comics

Tombstone has appeared in two Spider-Man animated series so far. He made his animated debut in 1994's Spider-Man (voiced by Dorian Harewood), where the focus of his story was on Lincoln's rivalry with Robbie Robertson. This version blamed Robertson for causing the accident that gave him his powers.

Tombstone later returned in 2008's The Spectacular Spider-Man (voiced first by Keith David and then by Kevin Michael Richardson). Early on, Tombstone was depicted as a powerful crime lord who masquerades as a kindly philanthropist. But eventually he was brought down during a gang war with Doctor Octopus and Silvermane and had his criminal empire taken over by Norman Osborn.

Following today's news that Henry Cavill is reportedly done with the role of Superman, Deadline reports that Warner Bros. has considered casting Michael B. Jordan in the role for future installments down the road.

Sources have reported that future Superman movies are several years out, but that Warner Bros. has been looking at different angles to take with future films, as they are aware the current DC universe has not seen the level of success with fans as they would like.

Jordan is known in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for his role in Black Panther as the antagonist, Erik Killmonger. If he would be cast as Superman in the future, Jordan would be the first black actor cast in that role.

As a future Superman solo movie is still years away, Warner Bros. has reportedly said they are focusing on a Supergirl origin movie as the studio's top priority right now.

Exit Theatre Mode

It was reported earlier that Warner Bros. was the one who parted ways from Cavill, making him the second main actor leaving the DC universe, as Ben Affleck is also reportedly finishing his role of Batman after Suicide Squad 2.

Following the box office disappointment from Justice League, Warner Bros. had decided to take on heavy restructuring with the DC Extended Universe.

All September long, IGN is spotlighting the best TV coming your way in the 2018-2019 season. Today, we're diving into Season 9 of The Walking Dead, premiering October 7 on AMC. While the world of the series is expanding with new communities and new cast additions, there will be plenty of threats for our heroes to face, both internally and externally. Not only will our favorite characters have to contend with the loss of Rick Grimes this season, they'll also be faced with a terrifying new threat - comic book villains the Whisperers.

The time has come: The Walking Dead will say goodbye to Rick Grimes in Season 9 - and if you're still in denial about Andrew Lincoln's impending departure, the show's latest promos aren't pulling their punches.

IGN has an exclusive sneak peek at a new teaser for Season 9, featuring an ominous prediction from Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and a stark reminder that ""Rick Grimes' final episodes begin Oct. 7.""

Exit Theatre Mode

To soothe our pain, IGN spoke to new showrunner Angela Kang about what we can expect (besides heartbreak) in Rick's final episodes, and she was quick to assure us that despite knowing that we're about to lose one of our favorite characters, Lincoln's farewell run will have ""an incredible emotional impact,"" and showcase some ""amazing"" work from the entire cast.

""This is new territory for us; obviously there have been characters that we’ve said goodbye to over the years, but he’s the person who brought us into the show,"" Kang conceded. ""But we have such a strong ensemble and there’s such beautiful scenes between a lot of these core characters that we’ve been tracking for many years. Rick has such interesting and deep relationships with these characters and you really feel the way that he has touched these different people’s lives, so I think these episodes that he’s in... Andy is incredible in them, for one thing, and I think our directors that have come in have done some of their finest work, so I’m excited for people to see the journey.""

She added, ""Obviously there’s a lot of expectations and we really hope that we don’t let people down; we hope that people come along for the ride, but I do think it’s an incredibly emotional journey and I think the performances and the work that people have done are pretty amazing.""

Our exclusive promo features a typically arrogant Negan, who smugly suggests that by forging these new communities, Rick isn't ""saving the world, you’re just getting it ready for me."" But despite his swagger, Kang teased that we'll see a very different side of Negan in Season 9.

""Of course Negan is still Negan - he can’t help but say things that are snarky or kind of rough, but we’re gonna see some really different emotional shades to him. He’s essentially been in solitary confinement for a year and a half since the end of last season, and one of the stories that we’re exploring is what that’s done to him,"" Kang said. ""So that really shifts the nature of the interactions he has. The other thing we’ll be doing this season that I’m excited about is, there was so much during the war that was mano a mano with Rick and Negan, and this year we’re gonna see some other people have some really significant interactions with him that I hope are a little different and surprising.""

It's a safe bet that one of those significant interactions will be with Maggie, who was denied her chance at justice after Rick unilaterally decided to spare Negan's life in the Season 8 finale, despite having previously promised that the bat-wielding sociopath would pay for killing Glenn and Abraham.

""In the moment, Rick made a decision largely out of his own grief for his son and his son’s wish for a future and a civilization. It’s not anything he ever discussed with his team, it was something he, in the moment, believed was the right thing to do and so he spared him. So when we come into the story, we’re going to see both the good and the bad sides of what’s happened in the wake of that decision,"" Kang previewed. ""We see that in some ways it worked to achieve the peace between the communities that Rick hoped for; it’s allowed them to move on and keep building, and yet it’s caused pain and its caused a rift in some ways between the philosophies of the communities, so that’s one of the big things we’ll be exploring. And obviously Maggie’s story in that is a major element of what we’ll see this season.""

And despite the fact that Lauren Cohan will only be in a limited number of episodes this season due to her lead role on ABC's midseason drama Whiskey Cavalier, Kang admitted that she's ""really excited about Maggie’s story this season,"" and reiterated that they have no plans to end it any time soon: ""Lauren came onto the show the same time I did, actually - so I’ve really enjoyed writing for her and working with her and the plan is to have more story with her, so we’ve figured out a way to have this chapter with Maggie. And we really see [that] she has fully come into her own as a leader - she’s a leader who is as strong, as formidable as Rick, who is smart and humane and she also, when she makes a promise to do something, she wants to pursue it, so that’s part of the story that we play. An element of the season is, we explore this idea of domino effects, and so we’ll see an event that happens in the first episode that dominoes in surprising ways into a really interesting story for Maggie.""

Exit Theatre Mode

Eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted a sign attached to a windmill that reads ""Commonwealth"" at the beginning of our promo and in the footage released out of San Diego Comic-Con, along with a signpost pointing to ""Toledo."" Fans of Robert Kirkman's comics will recognize the significance of that location and what it means for the larger story of The Walking Dead, but Kang admitted that while the Easter egg is a deliberate choice, we won't be seeing the Ohio-based community right when the season picks up.

""Obviously the Commonwealth does mean things to people; we’re starting to seed in some future stories. The timing of those stories may not be in the immediate future, but there will be things this season that are groundwork being laid for finding out more about the world,"" she teased. ""And one of the things I know fans have been interested by is this helicopter, and so we will learn a little bit more about that mystery and how it might connect to other people or other places.""

One group our survivors won't want to connect to should also be familiar to comic book fans - the Whisperers, led by Samantha Morton as Alpha.

Kang declined to go into too much detail about the threat that these new villains pose in Season 9, lest she spoil things for fans who aren't familiar with the comics, but did say, ""What I was so taken by in the comic - because that was being written as I was working on the show and I was reading it in real time and going 'oh my god, what’s happening?' - is the sense of unfolding discovery and mystery there, and the sense that walkers can be... a different kind of threat than we’ve had before, and they can be used in ways that we’ve never seen. It’s a story that has a lot of really strange and interesting layers. That’s one of the things that’s been most exciting to write this season.""

The Walking Dead Season 9 premieres Sunday, October 7 on AMC in the US, and on Monday, October 8 on Fox in the UK.","gabriel stokes pollyanna mcintosh

Chances are you probably haven't heard of North Farmington High School in Farmington Hills, Michigan. That changes now. The school's entire senior class took school ID cards to the next level, dressing themselves up in fun pop culture and meme references.

Even better, you don't have to go to Michigan and see them in person. The students use a simple #NFID19 hashtag to catalog them, and the class of 2019 isn't even the first year to do this. Seniors at North Farmington High School have been on this trend for several years, and there are no signs of them stopping.

There is certainly a level of effort that goes into these, from identifying who you will emulate, finding the outfit (and maybe potential backdrop), and getting it all ready for picture day.

When students share the ID in a side-by-side with the original, a quote or small description is also included. Since this has become a tradition for every senior class at the school, students have around four years to prep and make it happen. So there isn't really a good excuse if a student misses out.

Here are some of my favorites, but be sure to check them all out.

Sure, there are plenty of online reviews and photo galleries to browse through before the phones ship Friday (and the XR in a month), but unless you're a tech reporter who got a hands-on with the new devices, you have no real idea what these phones are like. And if you need a new phone, or if you think you might want one ASAP, walking into a store isn't an option prior to release.

That's where this online tool that 9to5Mac spotted can come in handy. The Hotspot3D is a visualizer that gives you a 360-degree view of a number of different phones, allowing you to compare Apple's new ones to, say, your current Samsung Galaxy S7 or an older iPhone 7.

You can even get as granular as changing up the color scheme, for an as-close-to-real view of what that new gold finish looks like or what shade of blue the XR comes in.

There are 23 phones to compare to each other and a credit card for size comparisons. The site launched earlier this year from a Netherlands-based team. and it even works on mobile (I spent an inordinate amount of time playing with the visualizer this weekend).

Razer has sent out invites for an Oct. 10 event with the hint ""Flagship // Gaming."" It seems that it's a reference to a second generation Razer Phone, but it doesn't give us much to go on.

The original phone was designed for the best gaming experience on mobile with some super fast hardware like 8GB of RAM and a 4,000mAh battery. Although like the iPhone, there was no headphone jack. Razer's CEO said that the removal of that port allowed for the larger battery, which makes sense for a phone that could potentially burn through power.

In the company's most recent interim 2018 results, Razer noted that the development teams are focused on a follow up to the first generation Razer Phone. It will likely double down on hardware, design, and the software it uses.

Razer will be facing stiff competition as Google is set to unveil the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL at an Oct. 9 event, and Samsung is planning a Galaxy launch event for Oct. 11. Not to mention the fact that Apple unveiled the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR on Sept. 12.

More importantly in the long term, you can rest easy knowing that Apple is not going to push your shipping date back, or at least isn't planning to.

In years past, Apple has been a bit slow to send out tracking numbers, likely as the devices first ship from China and have to come over to US hubs for shipping. If you're eager to know where your iPhone is, UPS is usually the shipping provider, and tracking by reference with an order number or phone number might let you find it.

The season of giving is almost upon us, but this year why not give gifts that you can enjoy as well? Why not give a gift you can borrow?

Think about it: Giving a friend a gift you'd want to receive yourself shows that you've picked out a high quality item and have selflessly given it away, rather than keeping it for yourself. Is it so terrible to want to borrow it from time to time? My feeling: no, it is not. What friend or loved one wouldn't want you to think economically while gift shopping?

Still, perhaps it is best to keep people in the dark about your plans to borrow their stuff — for a few days, at least.

Here are some of the best gifts for sharing, from cooking gadgets to subscription boxes:

A nice set of speakers are invaluable, especially when it comes to setting the mood for parties and relaxed hang-outs, alike. If you don't have the cash to get a set of speakers for you and your bud, you can count on borrowing these after you gift them.

Chances are your friend won't be using them all the time, and if you pick a relatively small speaker like Vomercy's Bluetooth Speakers, it'll be pretty easy to borrow for a party of your own.





Sure, a tool kit isn't the sexiest gift to give someone, but everyone needs a tool kit if they don't have one yet. Plus, you'll know exactly who to go to when you have to put together a new Ikea desk, and you won't have to shell out more cash on your own kit.

Workpro makes a pretty affordable 29-piece tool kit that comes with its own handy roll-up bag, making it easy to transport from a friend's house to yours.





A candy-of-the-month subscription box from Candy Club is a wonderful gift, but odds are that whoever you give it to will end up with more candy than they can handle. That's where you step in.

Just gently remind your friend or family member that you're happy to take any extra candy off their hands. And it doesn't just have to be candy. You can also gift other subscription box services like Birchbox or Try the World, in the hopes of having the extras your friend's not interested in sent your way.





Games are obviously perfect for sharing — especially party games like Cards Against Humanity which require multiple people to play.

Price: $25 on Amazon

Books are quite possibly the most borrow-able gift. Once your friend's finished, it's unlikely she'll pick it up again, unless she's a member of a very serious book club.

If there's a bestseller you were looking to read, or a cookbook that you want but just can't justify buying for yourself, get it for a friend and ask to borrow it once they've finished (or forgetten) it.

Our book pick: Crazy Rich Asians, by Kevin Kwan. The New York Times bestseller is the inspiration for one of this summer's most talked about (and most profitable) films.

Price: $9.60 on Amazon

If you live with roommates or a significant other, this is an especially great gift to borrow. If it's left out in a common area, or your partner is out of the house, the blanket is yours for the taking — I mean...borrowing.

This Brielle Cozy Cable Knit Throw with Sherpa Lining is an affordable blanket with a soft lining and a classic design. Your friend will want in every color (there are six by the way.)





No one, and I mean no one, needs to use a karaoke machine at all times, but it's a fun thing to break out at parties. Give this to your karaoke-loving friend and then ask to borrow it for a party of your own. Or, even better, use it with your friend when you're at their pad.

The Singing Machine Karaoke machine connects to Bluetooth, YouTube, Pandora, is CD compatible, and has funky lights to create the perfect mood for belting out your favorite songs.





Glossier's trio of its cult-favorite Balm Dotcom skin and lip balms are the perfect shareable gift. With more than one balm, why not keep one for yourself?

The same rule applies to this set of 15 Etude sheet masks, and this collection of Lush bath bombs and oils.





Giving someone a cooking gadget you're curious about or have been interested in trying is a good way to test the product out without the guilt of paying for something you're not sure you'll use.

The Instant Pot, which has the ability to slow cook, pressure cook, steam rice and, if you can believe it, make yogurt is a good option. But a sous vide cooker, or an ice cream maker would also make wonderful, borrowable gifts.

This is another gift that's easiest to borrow if you're gifting it to a roommate or a significant other, but maybe if you're crafty, you can figure out how to borrow it from a friend or family member that lives out of town, too.","new york times bestseller

According to new research, it doesn't take very much.

A study published in the journal Nature Thursday found that sea turtles have a 50 percent higher chance of mortality once they've ingested 14 pieces of plastic.

This means that researchers would expect 50 percent of sea turtles who have eaten this amount of plastic to die. The scientists also found that if a turtle had at least 226 pieces of plastic in its gut, then it was certain to die.

Scientists have been ramping up efforts to examine the precise impacts of ocean pollution on marine life, now that plastic has been found to affect 700 different marine species according to the newstudy's lead researcher Britta Denise Hardesty.

To calculate the impact, a team of scientists led by Hardesty examined data from roughly 300 turtle necropsies around Australia whose deaths were recorded under three different categories: non-plastic related, unknown cause, plastic-related.

Somewhere between 8 to 12 million metric tons of plastic debris was deposited in the ocean in 2010. Image: kathy townsend

Using these distinctions, researchers were able to compare the unknown and plastic-related deaths to the plastic-related deaths to determine what is considered a normal amount of plastic ingested by turtles.

Within the population they sampled, the amount of debris found in the turtles’ guts ranged from a single piece to 329 pieces.

However, not all scientists agree with the study's conclusions.

“I am more optimistic than the authors,” biologist Jennifer Lynch, who is unaffiliated with the study, said in an email.

A study she conducted in 2017 found that turtles are not impacted by small amounts of plastic debris or even after ingesting 200 to 300 pieces of plastic.

“All studies have some kind of bias, my study was biased towards turtles that were healthy and actively foraging when they drowned on a longline hook,"" Lynch, who plans to write a rebuttal to the study with other researchers, said.

""[The present] study is biased towards stranded turtles that died from a variety of causes, often unknown causes.""

That said, the new study does add to a growing body of scientific literature on plastics and turtle mortality.

Another important finding in the study had to do with the age of the turtles effected by the debris.

Researchers also found a significantly larger amount of plastic in juvenile turtles compared to adults. To them, this signaled that adults are less likely to mistakenly ingest plastic than younger sea turtles.

Not all scientists are on the same page about how much plastic a turtle can ingest safely. Image: kathy townsend

Brendan Godley, a conservation scientist unaffiliated with the study, said in an email that this research points to the likelihood that plastic is a key threat to the youngest life stages which was suspected, but not known.

“This is of particular concern as pieces of plastics and baby turtles are both likely to be aggregated together in similar areas,” he explained.

But this doesn’t mean that turtles are on their way to extinction. Sea turtle populations are actually responding well to conservation efforts.

It just signals that if ocean pollution gets worse, sea turtles are in harm’s way, Godley said.

While the exact amount of plastic leading to fatality might be hotly debated, scientists have been aware that plastic is a threat to sea turtle populations for a while. In fact, sea turtles were among the first animals recorded to ingest plastic.

And with rising plastic deposits in the ocean, the threat debris poses to marine life has expanded far beyond just sea turtles and will continue to expand if a solution isn’t found.","kathy townsend brendan godley

Think back to the Oscars screw-up of 2017, which basically happened to BoJack a year before in Season 3, when Mr. Peanutbutter mistakenly awarded him Best Actor. Comparisons between the show's Season 4 Episode ""Thoughts and Prayers"" always come up after a mass shooting, too. Most recently after the Parkland school shooting, an Alabama lawmaker said that the problem with some Republicans' proposal to arm teachers is that some teachers are (hold your gasps) women!

And, you know, women can't be trusted with guns. Which was totally a BoJack thing first.

Much like the classic ""Simpsons Already Did It"" joke, BoJack Horseman has become like the canary in the cole mine for some of our biggest social issues (in only a fraction of seasons as The Simpsons to boot).

So it should come as no surprise, then, that the Season 5 episode ""BoJack the Feminist"" feels like a prophetic depiction of how easily we're starting to forgive the abusive men called out by the #MeToo movement. It's also no surprise that the original idea for the episode came long before the movement became popular, and much earlier than the inevitable comebacks now being attempted by Louis C.K. and others.

According to show creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, the inspiration for the episode — or specifically the character of Vance Waggoner — was from one of his real-life Hollywood experiences.

""The spark of the idea came from when my own agency CAA signed Mel Gibson on as a client. And I was really upset about that,"" said Waksberg. ""I feel uneasy with the idea that part of my paycheck or my show's budget goes to a company that's working to help the career of this guy that has screamed racial epithets at people and abused women.""

Waksberg even complained about it to the talent agency. He recounted how he was then, ""very politely but firmly told that, 'While we value you and your input and love that you care so deeply about this, we're going to keep this man as our client. Because we believe this is the right thing to do for us.'""

(Mashable reached out to both Gibson and Waksberg's CAA representatives for comment, but did not receive a reply. Gibson's publicist gave the following statement: ""We have no knowledge of this matter."")

So that was that. He considered leaving CAA, but realized there really aren't other talent agencies that would be better, or that wouldn't sign Gibson, or someone else he objects to.

And this widespread, systemic complacency with letting bad men back into the industry became a focal point of the entire season.

""It's emblematic of us as a larger society, and the industry as a whole.""

Both Waksberg and series art director Lisa Hanawalt were clear that, despite the inspiration, Vance Waggoner is not a one-to-one representation of Gibson. And the episode is not just about Waksberg airing his personal grievance against Gibson.

""But I do think it's emblematic of us as a larger society, and the industry as a whole,"" he said.

Instead, Waggoner is more like this monstrous mutation of all the bad behavior we've let famous men get away with.

The opening scene surely recalls Gibson's infamous arrest video. But Waggoner's also later accused of physically abusing a sex worker, choking his wife, sexting underage girls, and drunkenly calling his daughter a slut.

Just off the top of our head, the long list of men accused of that kind of behavior includes David Hasselhoff, Johnny Depp, Alec Baldwin, James Franco, Gary Oldman, and countless others.

When Hanawalt set about designing Waggoner's look, she worked hard to create a composite of multiple men. She thought to herself, ""Ok, he's gotta be kind of handsome, but kind of a bad boy, but also kind of look like all these dudes mashed up together,"" she said. ""And I think I nailed it.""

Did she ever. Waggoner's appearance and dialogue is triggeringly recognizable to all who've paid attention to the commonalities in the stories about abusive men in Hollywood over the years.

Vance Waggoner is #MeToo déjà vu in the worst way. Image: netflix

But like the episode and overall season's approach to these issues, Waksberg's thinking is not black and white when it comes to forgiving people in the industry who've acted badly in the past.

""I don't want to be saying that, as a society, we shouldn't forgive people. I think forgiveness is very important,"" he said. Aside from being very personally significant to him, he also noted how forgiveness and redemption is a major theme in the show itself.

""But I also think some people are largely being forgiven too easily.""

""Some people are largely being forgiven too easily.""

To Waksberg, what's needed is nuance in the difference between forgiving a public figure like Gibson on a personal vs. professional level.

""I want to believe he can do the work on himself and can be forgiven, but at least publicly, I have not seen evidence of that. And I don't think I personally forgive him.""

Exploring the most difficult conversations around #MeToo and Time's Up in Season 5 feels like a natural evolution for the show.

The issues surrounding sexism and racism in Hollywood have been a huge concern of the show and its creators, almost since the very beginning. Waksberg said that's because harassment, assault, and inequity unavoidably come up in a writers' room full of industry people talking about how to satirize the industry.

""We didn't necessarily anticipate what would happen this year when we set about to write this story,"" he said. ""But a lot of what's come to light [during #MeToo] we knew about before."" The specifics or extent of the abuse might've been news to even the biggest insiders of entertainment, ""but the general behavior is not news.""

It's all about pointing the finger on the forgiveness tour. Image: netflix

For art director Hanawalt, the show's prescience on those topics comes back to who they hire to work on BoJack, and ensuring they welcome people to speak up. While both she and Waksberg own up to the fact that they can and need to do better as far as diversity on their staff, there are still a lot more women in creative roles than most shows.

And the rawness of how the season tackles #MeToo and Time's Up makes it clear that those people — particularly the women — are indeed being heard. It's probably what gives it that extra edge.

""I just feel like when a show is written and created by all white, straight men, it doesn't tend to have the sharpest insight anymore,"" Hanawalt said. ""The status quo isn't always going to be the most exciting thing. That's why you hire people who have the most interesting things to say, not the people who make you the most comfortable with what you're already saying.""

""When a show is written and created by all white, straight men, it doesn't tend to have the sharpest insight anymore.""

That's also perhaps one of the reasons why BoJack Horseman's tackling of #MeToo doesn't feel new and fresh, but devastatingly true. Like, for example, when Dianne is hired to be the woman writer on BoJack's new show Phillbert — then is told to be quiet, sit in the corner, and not chew gum loudly.

""This episode is the most exaggerated version of it, but it's surprisingly realistic to many people's experiences on the staff: Being hired, then expected to just be a beard for diversity as a woman or person of color or whatever else,"" she said.

What Season 5 has shown is that — as we near the comeback portion of the #MeToo movement — a series like BoJack Horseman has something uniquely important to contribute to this conversation.

""Bojack has done bad things, and it's interesting to — in this season — see those chickens come home to roost, as it were,"" said Hanawalt.

In the writers' room, Waksberg said they kept asking themselves this question of, why do we keep giving these kinds of guys more and more chances? ""And then that turned into, well, do we think BoJack deserves other chances?""

The ""Forgivies"" might as well be the Oscars. Image: netflix

The character of BoJack creates an interesting, important challenge for both its creators and fans. As an audience, we've come to know and invest in him personally. And now that we as a culture have finally started to question whether awful men like him deserve to be forgiven, the show gives us a glimpse into the turmoil of how one deals with realizing their friend is one of those men.

""Quite accidentally, we've come at a time where there's one more story to tell about that kind of person — which is a story a lot of people have not told about these privileged, heterosexual, damaged men that really grapples with investigating the toxicity,"" said Waksberg. ""We're in the twilight of stories. So I'd like to think we are finding the last interesting ground.""

""Real life is too absurd. it's crazier than a cartoon out there.""

BoJack Season 5 doesn't present easy answers for the hard question of what to do with the people in the entertainment industry who abused their power to do horrible things. More than anything, it asks us to wrestle with those uncomfortable questions.

""What is the difference between forgiveness and encouraging someone to be better, versus letting someone off the hook?"" Waksberg asked.

Ultimately, as a successful straight white guy himself, he says his role in the larger conversation about equality is to listen, then ""learning how to navigate and use my privilege as a stepping stone or microphone for others,"" he said. ""It's been a process. I'm still in the process.""

For Hanawalt, like so many other people from marginalized groups in the entertainment industry, the injustices explored on the show this season always border on being almost too real.

Because, she said, ""Real life is too absurd. it's crazier than a cartoon out there.""","david hasselhoff johnny depp alec baldwin james franco gary oldman

Okay, laptops are significantly cheaper than that and your life and safety or whatever doesn't exactly depend on it — but your job and other important life things (like Netflix) are made so much better by the addition of a reliable laptop.

Our point: Laptops are not one-size-fits-all, and this isn't a choice that can be made just based on price or looks. It's what's on the inside that counts: Beginners need something user-friendly and straightforward, frequent travelers need something light with a long battery life, designers and gamers need top-notch 4K graphics and quick central processors, and everyone needs something that's not gonna shit out on them after a year. We're sweating already.

Luckily, this is the kind of stuff we enjoy researching, and we've put together a definitive guide to the best laptops on the market right now. We compare top brands that you probably have in mind like Apple, Dell, and Acer, as well as other huge players you may not have even seen coming like Huawei and Lenovo. Trust us, you're in good hands.

If you've done any other laptop research recently, this pick isn't quite a shocker. The Huawei MateBook X Pro has been dubbed *the best* laptop right now by numerous media brands including PCMag The Verge , and Tech Radar . Mashable did a video on it earlier this year comparing it to the longstanding champ, the MacBook Pro, and guess who came out on top? Huawei. It's a pretty obvious shameless copy of the MacBook Pro's thin look with a fingerprint sensor, but has nicer specs packed into such a lightweight device — which is ideal for people who travel a lot or have an annoying commute to work. Plus, the battery is said to last up to 12 hours (unheard of for a laptop this size), which will make long days significantly more painless.The 13.9-inch, 3K 3,000 x 2,080 touchscreen display is crystal clear and movie-theatre like, featuring ultra thin bezels and a Nvidia GeForce MX150 2GB GDDR5 graphics card.

(It's also the more expensive, upgraded version of the Yoga 720, if you were confused about that.)One of the best updates we see is the webcam being moved from the bottom of the screen to the top, which is (surprisingly) something a lot of other laptops can't say. IDK what's with manufacturers forcing that awkward angle on us, but we appreciate Lenovo getting rid of it. It doesn't support facial recognition via Windows Hello yet, but there is a fingerprint reader, so logging in is still a breeze. It is slightly heavier than most competitors of the same size, but there's no clunkiness to be found — the 920 is sleek, notably sturdy, and decked out in metal (but that also makes it vulnerable to fingerprints). Inside, the specs are just as good: The Core i7-8550U runs at a stellar 1.8Ghz and is especially quick when it comes to Photoshop and other editing software, giving the MacBook Pro a run for its money when it comes to speed.The 13.9-inch touchscreen has a standard 1920 x 1080 display with the option to switch to 4K — just note that using 4K takes battery life from 15 hours to around 10. Colors and viewing angles are superb, giving the coveted movie theatre-like experience, especially in tent mode. (The speakers also face you in tent mode, so audio will be loud and crisp for Netflix and chill.) It does smudge a little more easily than we'd like, but snagging the Lenovo Active Pen 2 can solve that. This is ideal for professional creatives who want to sketch or doodle without lugging around physical paper or for college students taking notes. It's a bummer that it's not included, and the fact that storing the pen takes up one of the 920's two USB 3.0 ports is annoying and looks awkward. Small inconvenience compared to the entire package, though.Read PCMag's full review here and snag the Yoga 920 for $1,370 here.

Scientists tap into the individual differences that make some people more susceptible to a placebo.



Brain anatomy and personality type may influence susceptibility to the placebo effect. Brain anatomy and personality type may influence susceptibility to the placebo effect.

A placebo is a medical intervention — be it a pill, injection, or sham surgery — that has no therapeutic value.

The placebo effect refers to the real benefits that these inert interventions can have.

The simple act of taking a tablet can make a person feel its benefits.

However, this is not just a psychological phenomenon; it has a biological basis.

As one example, some studies have shown that a placebo can affect blood pressure; a clear physiological response.

However, the placebo effect is most apparent in conditions that rely on self-reporting of symptoms, such as anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic pain.

In chronic pain trials, for instance, the placebo effect can often be as great as the response to the treatment that is being tested. In actual fact, the response to a placebo can sometimes be larger than the response to conventional treatment.

Placebo as a viable option

Because the standard drugs that are used to treat chronic pain can have significant adverse effects over time, the potential for an inert tablet to benefit some patients is of great interest. One of the difficulties, though, is that not everyone is equally susceptible to the placebo effect.

A recent study set out to probe this problem: could it be possible to predict the size of someone's response to a placebo before they take it? The results were recently published in the journal Nature Communications.

To investigate, scientists at Northwestern University in Illinois studied 60 volunteers with chronic back pain. They split the group into two study arms; one took either the drug or placebo, while another attended the clinic but underwent no treatment.

Each person completed a number of in-depth questionnaires that assessed their personality and the type of pain that they experienced. They also went through four neuroimaging sessions.

As expected, some individuals who took the placebo felt significant pain relief; these participants were then examined further.

The scientists found that those who responded to the placebo had asymmetry in their subcortical limbic system, which is a part of the brain involved in emotion.

Particularly, the investigators found it to be larger on the right side than on the left. These people also had a larger cortical sensory area than those who did not respond to the placebo.

Also, volunteers with a strong placebo response were more emotionally self-aware, mindful of their environment, and sensitive to painful situations.

No need for secrets

Study author A. Vania Apkarian, a professor of physiology at Northwestern University, believes that ""[c]linicians who are treating chronic pain patients should seriously consider that some will get as good a response to a sugar pill as any other drug. They should use it and see the outcome. This opens up a whole new field.""

Giving a patient a placebo can seem somewhat underhanded, but for those who are sensitive to its powers, this need not be the case.

""You can tell them, 'I'm giving you a drug that has no physiological effect but your brain will respond to it.' You don't need to hide it. There is a biology behind the placebo response."" Prof. A Vania Apkarian

These results could be significant for people with chronic pain and other conditions, and they might also revolutionize the way that some clinical trials are carried out.

The placebo effect has long been a thorn in the side of medical research; knowing exactly what has relieved the symptoms — be it the drug or the placebo effect — can never truly be known.

However, if researchers know which participants are likely to have larger placebo responses, they can screen them out initially, providing more reliable results in the long run.

As Prof. Apkarian explains, ""Drug trials would need to recruit fewer people, and identifying the physiological effects would be much easier.""

The more we understand about the placebo effect, the closer we get to treating illnesses without the need for toxic chemicals. ""It's much better to give someone a nonactive drug rather than an active drug and get the same result,"" Prof. Apkarian adds.

Although the placebo effect holds a great many mysteries left to solve, the more we understand, the closer we get to treating certain conditions in a much gentler manner.","nature communications

Dairy products may benefit cardiovascular health, says new research. Dairy products may benefit cardiovascular health, says new research.

The United States Department of Agriculture and American Heart Association (AHA) both recommend that adults do not exceed three servings of low-fat dairy per day.

The high content of saturated fat found in dairy products, they warn, may raise the levels of ""bad"" cholesterol, which poses a threat to cardiovascular health.

However, new research is challenging these guidelines.

For instance, a recent study has suggested that the fatty acids found in whole-fat dairy may have a protective role against heart disease and stroke.

Now, a large-scale observational study has reviewed the dietary habits of over 130,000 people in 21 countries across five continents and found that whole-fat dairy correlates with a lower risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease.

Dr. Mahshid Dehghan — from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada — is the lead author of the new research.

Whole-fat dairy lowers mortality risk

Dr. Dehghan and colleagues used food questionnaires to collect self-reported data on the eating habits of 136,384 people over a follow-up period of 9.1 years. The people surveyed were aged between 35 and 70, and the dairy products they consumed were milk, yogurt, and cheese.

For the purposes of the study, a portion of dairy comprised either a glass of milk of 244 grams, a cup of yogurt of 244 grams, a 15-gram slice of cheese, or a 5-gram teaspoon of butter.

Based on these intakes, the team divided the volunteers into four groups: those who consumed no dairy, those whose intake did not exceed one serving per day, those who consumed one to two servings daily, and the ""high-intake"" group, who consumed over two daily servings — or 3.2 servings, on average — every day.

The study revealed that people in the high-intake group were less likely to die from any cause, less likely to die of cardiovascular disease, and less likely to have a stroke or develop major heart disease.

Also, within the group that regularly consumed full-fat dairy only, the researchers found that the more whole-fat dairy was consumed, the lower the risk of mortality and cardiovascular issues.

""Our findings support that consumption of dairy products might be beneficial for mortality and cardiovascular disease, especially in low-income and middle-income countries where dairy consumption is much lower than in North America or Europe."" Dr. Mahshid Dehghan

Should dietary guidelines be changed?

Although this is an observational study that cannot confirm causality, the results suggest that some saturated fats in whole-fat dairy could benefit cardiovascular health, as do some vitamins and calcium. Does this mean that the current dietary guidelines should be changed?

Previous research that found similar results suggested that the guidelines do need revising. However, a linked commentary written by Jimmy Chun Yu Louie, at the University of Hong Kong, and Anna M. Rangan, from the University of Sydney in Australia, explains why that may not be such a good idea yet.

""The results from the [...] study seem to suggest that dairy intake, especially whole-fat dairy, might be beneficial for preventing deaths and major cardiovascular diseases,"" they write.

""However, as the authors themselves concluded, the results only suggest the 'consumption of dairy products should not be discouraged and perhaps even be encouraged in low-income and middle-income countries.'""

""[The study] is not the ultimate seal of approval for recommending whole-fat dairy over its low-fat or skimmed counterparts,"" they add. ""Readers should be cautious, and treat this study only as yet another piece of the evidence (albeit a large one) in the literature.""","united states department of agriculture and american heart association aha

Astrocytes are named for their star-like shape. Image credit: GerryShaw Astrocytes are named for their star-like shape. Image credit: GerryShaw

Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects at least 2 million people worldwide.

Recent estimates suggest that 1 million people in the United States live with the condition.

The autoimmune condition causes inflammation of the central nervous system, as the immune system attacks the insulating layer of myelin protecting neurons in the brain and spinal cord.

However, neuroinflammation does not only characterize MS; recent studies show that depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder are also linked to dysfunctions in the immune response, in addition to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's.

Now, new research has furthered our understanding of this inflammatory process. Researchers at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (SBP) in San Diego, CA, have found that a subtype of astrocytes — that is, star-shaped, non-neuronal brain cells that support the good functioning of neurons — play a key role in the early onset of brain inflammation.

Dr. Jerold Chun, the senior vice president of Neuroscience Drug Discovery at SBP, led the research, which was just published in the journal eNeuro.

The role of 'ieAstrocytes' in an MS model

Dr. Chun and colleagues created a mouse model of MS, a condition they think ""epitomizes"" brain inflammation.

Using a fluorescent neuroimaging technique called cFos imaging, the scientists were able to see which nerve cells became activated, or ""lit up,"" as the disease advanced.

Dr. Chun summarizes the team's findings, saying, ""We expected to see immune cells light up — but surprisingly, they weren't activated. Neither were neurons or microglia.""

Instead, they found that a subtype of astrocytes were activated early on, which the scientists called ""immediate early astrocytes,"" or ieAstrocytes.

""ieAstrocytes,"" he says, ""were the first and predominant cells activated during disease initiation and progression, suggesting that they are a key gatekeeper and mediator of disease.""

He adds, ""This is a departure from our previous understanding that astrocytes are spectator cells, only 'moving to the dark side' once initial damage has occurred.""

Also, the number of ieAstrocytes increased as brain inflammation advanced and the disease got more severe. Furthermore, treating the mice with an MS drug called fingolimod reduced the number of these brain cells.

Better treatments for brain inflammation

Osteoarthritis commonly affects knee joints. Osteoarthritis commonly affects knee joints.

Osteoarthritis is the most common arthritis type, causing pain and stiffness in the joints as cartilage steadily breaks down.

It is often referred to as ""wear and tear"" arthritis, as opposed to rheumatoid arthritis, which is caused by an immune response.

Most commonly affecting a person's hands, knees, hips, feet, and spine, osteoarthritis symptoms tend to get worse over time.

Symptoms of joint swelling and tenderness can come and go over time — or, in some people, they can be constant. The degree of severity varies a great deal between individuals.

As the most common joint disorder in the United States, osteoarthritis affects over 30 million adults.

Several interventions can help manage osteoarthritis, including physical therapy, medications, and surgery. To date, however, nothing halts the progression of this debilitating condition.

It is still not exactly clear why cartilage continues to break down, and what mechanisms underpin the changes.

Risk factors for osteoarthritis include advancing age and obesity, so as the global population becomes older and heavier, the condition is likely to become increasingly prevalent.

Delving deeper into osteoarthritis

Recently, researchers led by Frederique Cornelis — from KU Leuven in Belgium — looked into the cellular changes involved in osteoarthritis and the interactions between certain proteins. Their findings are published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Specifically, the team was interested in ANP32A, which is a protein involved in a number of roles within cells, including intracellular transport and cell differentiation.

The researchers noted that levels of ANP32A were significantly lower in tissue samples from both humans and mice with osteoarthritis. This piqued their interest — so, using gene expression profiling, they dug a little deeper into the protein's function.

They used a mouse model that is incapable of producing ANP32A, which causes them to develop osteoarthritis and osteopenia, or bone loss. They also developed a condition similar to cerebellar ataxia, symptoms of which include stumbling and a lack of coordination.

The study authors summarize their initial findings:

""ANP32A protects against the development and progression of osteoarthritis by preventing oxidative stress in the articular cartilage.""

Adding an antioxidant

Next, the researchers tested the effects of adding an antioxidant called N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) to drinking water.

They found that adding NAC to the animals' diet reduced symptoms of osteoarthritis, and cartilage damage seemed to be halted. Symptoms of cerebellar ataxia were also reduced.

To understand what mechanism might be behind ANP32A's ability to reverse these symptoms, the researchers dug a little deeper. They found that ANP32A raises the levels of an enzyme known as ATM, which plays an important role in regulating cellular defensive responses against oxidative stress .

They explain, ""ANP32A's protective role can be attributed to promoting the expression of ATM in the articular cartilage, to preserve the cellular redox balance.""

In other words, if ANP32A is not present, there is less ATM available to mop up the free radicals that are causing damage to the cartilage.

The authors hope that understanding the role of ANP32A and ATM in more depth could lead to interventions for a number of difficult-to-treat and poorly understood conditions.

They believe that their findings ""may have therapeutic implications not only in chronic joint disorders but also in bone and neurological diseases.""

However, there is much work still to do; as the authors make clear, this molecular interaction is unlikely to be the only mechanism involved in osteoarthritis. In the future, the team hopes to investigate other factors that might influence ANP32A production in cartilage.","frederique cornelis

This can be difficult if they are out of the house or workplace, as not all businesses have public washrooms.

Many states in the United States have passed the Restroom Access Act, also known as Ally's Law, to acknowledge this medical need.

Ally's Law requires that retail businesses with toilet facilities for employees allow customers with specific medical conditions to access them if the need arises.

Read on to learn more about Ally's Law, including where it applies and how it works.

What is Ally's Law?



Ally's Law is part of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Ally's Law is part of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

Ally's Law requires retail establishments to allow people with certain medical conditions, such as IBD, to access an employee restroom if no public facilities are available and they need to go.

The law got its name from Ally Bain, a young woman from Illinois who has IBD. Doctors have diagnosed approximately 3 million adults in the U.S. with IBD, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

When Ally was 14 years old and shopping with her mother in a large retail store, she experienced a Crohn's disease flare, which included a sudden urge to go to the toilet. There were no public restrooms, so she asked to use the employee restroom. The manager denied Ally access, and she had an accident in the store.

Ally and her mother met with Illinois State Representative Kathy Ryg to draft a bill allowing people to use an employee restroom if they have a medical condition and are in urgent need. The bill became law in Illinois in August 2005. Since then, several other states have passed the Restroom Access Act.

Ally's Law falls under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This Act protects people with disabilities from discrimination.

Examples of some of the conditions that fall under the Restroom Access Act include:

Crohn's disease

ulcerative colitis

other types of IBD

irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

any condition involving the use of an ostomy device

any permanent or temporary condition requiring immediate access to a restroom

Ally's Law also covers pregnancy as a medical condition in some states.

Where does it apply?

The states that currently recognize Ally's Law are:

Colorado

Connecticut

Delaware

Illinois

Kentucky

Maine

Maryland

Massachusetts

Michigan

Minnesota

Ohio

Oregon

Tennessee

Texas

Washington

Wisconsin

In most cases, these states have passed the Act as a result of grassroots efforts by those with IBD and their supporters. Other states are currently developing similar laws.

In some states, business owners have strongly opposed the Restroom Access Act over fears of liability or concerns that some people will abuse the law. However, there is little evidence to support these worries.

How does Ally's Law work?



In some states, pregnancy is considered a suitable condition for Ally's Law. In some states, pregnancy is considered a suitable condition for Ally's Law.

The law in each state usually requires a person to show proof of an eligible medical condition to a business owner or employee.

Proof may be in the form of a document that a medical professional has signed stating that the person has a condition that may require the immediate use of a restroom. Alternatively, it might be an identification card that a national organization has issued.

The law may vary slightly from one state to another. For example, some states include pregnancy as a suitable condition while others do not. Not all states accept an identification card in place of a signed medical document.

Some businesses may be exempt from the Restroom Access Act. Those with fewer than three employees, for example, are not obliged to let a customer use an employee toilet as it may leave the store open to damage or theft.

The law does not require retail stores to alter their facilities in any way for people with eligible conditions.

Establishments are also not liable if a customer sustains an injury while using an employee restroom unless there is evidence of negligence on the part of the business.

Other support

Those with a relevant medical condition, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, can seek additional support from the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.

Members can get an ""I Can't Wait"" card, which states that they have a medical condition that requires urgent restroom access.

Alternatively, the Crohn's & Colitis website provides additional information on IBD. People with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis can obtain a Restroom Request Card from this website.

What happens if a company refuses?

If a business denies a person with valid documentation access to a restroom, they may incur a fine or another punishment. The penalties vary from state to state.

In Washington, first-time offenders receive a warning letter. Refusing access for the second time is a class 2 civil infraction.

In Massachusetts, there is a $100 fine for a first-time offense, which doubles for a second offense.

A person with an eligible condition and valid documentation can contact their local law enforcement agency if a business refuses to give them access to a restroom.

If the local law enforcement agency fails to deal with the matter, it is best to contact an elected official, such as:

the mayor

the county executive

a local senate representative

It may also be helpful to contact local news agencies or a national organization to bring attention to the issue.

Takeaway

Some people require immediate and urgent access to a restroom. If a public toilet is not available, they may be able to use an employee-only restroom, provided that they meet specific criteria.

These include living in a state that recognizes the Restroom Access Act, having an eligible medical condition, and carrying the appropriate documentation.

Identification cards are available from national organizations for people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Alternatively, a doctor can provide an individual with the necessary documentation.

If businesses do not comply with Ally's Law, people can contact law enforcement or an elected official.","delaware illinois kentucky maine maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota ohio oregon tennessee texas washington wisconsin

Arthritis is an inflammatory condition that causes pain and swelling in the joints, which can restrict mobility and damage the joints.

Arthritis medications are usually effective, though some people also look to alternative treatments to relieve their symptoms, including apple cider vinegar.

Apple cider vinegar is a traditional home remedy that some people use to treat a variety of conditions from nausea to skin conditions. But does it work for arthritis, and is it safe?

Can apple cider vinegar help with arthritis?



Apple cider vinegar may help treat arthritis symptoms. Apple cider vinegar may help treat arthritis symptoms.

Some people find that drinking a small amount of diluted apple cider vinegar can help with their arthritis symptoms.

However, there is not enough evidence to suggest that it works, and the Arthritis Foundation have included apple cider on their list of food myths about arthritis.

Despite the lack of scientific evidence, we take a look at some ways that apple cider vinegar might work for arthritis symptoms.

Inflammation

Inflammation in the joints is the primary cause of pain, swelling, and sometimes, permanent joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Other forms of arthritis involve much lower levels of inflammation, including osteoarthritis (OA).

Many people use standard anti-inflammatory medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), to control inflammation. Some people also include specific anti-inflammatory foods in their diet to manage their symptoms.

However, supporters of apple cider vinegar believe that it contains anti-inflammatory properties that can help with arthritis symptoms, including pain and swelling, in the same way that medication does.

However, there is no scientific evidence that apple cider vinegar is an effective anti-inflammatory agent in humans, or that it can help treat arthritis symptoms. This means it is difficult to know what effects it has.

Pectin

Apple cider vinegar also contains pectin. Some people think that pectin can absorb specific toxins that have built up and contributed to their symptoms.

However, according to the Arthritis Foundation, there is no research that shows whether or not pectin can help with arthritis pain.

Apple cider vinegar and weight loss



The use of apple cider vinegar for weight loss requires further research. The use of apple cider vinegar for weight loss requires further research.

People with arthritis may find relief in their symptoms by maintaining a healthy weight, as this reduces the pressure on their joints.

Apple cider vinegar may help people with arthritis to lose weight.

Some research has suggested that vinegar, including apple cider vinegar, can help to control blood sugar levels and contribute to weight loss. However, the study showed mixed results, and further research is needed.

Is it safe to drink apple cider vinegar?

While the benefits of apple cider vinegar are unclear at this stage, it is relatively safe to drink. However, it is very acidic, so it is important to dilute it first.

Apple cider vinegar may interact with certain types of medication, such as diabetes medications.

For many people taking apple cider vinegar, the risk of adverse effects is low but side effects can include:

digestive issues

erosion of tooth enamel

skin problems

throat irritation

Other home remedies for arthritis



Tart cherry juice is an alternative remedy to apple cider vinegar. Tart cherry juice is an alternative remedy to apple cider vinegar.

Many people find that regular exercise, which keeps the joints active and improves joint flexibility, can have wide-ranging effects on their arthritis symptoms.

People with inflammatory arthritis may also benefit from following an anti-inflammatory diet.

Along with these lifestyle changes, people can try alternative home remedies. Some of these home remedies for arthritis are backed up with more evidence than apple cider vinegar. These include:

Cherries

Cherries contain a range of antioxidants that could be useful for controlling inflammation in arthritis.

In a small-scale 2012 study, 20 women with inflammatory OA were given tart cherry juice or a placebo cherry drink to consume twice a day for 21 days. The researchers found that the women who drank the tart cherry juice had significantly reduced levels of one of the markers that indicate inflammation.

A 2013 study also found that drinking tart cherry juice each day for 6 weeks improved osteoarthritis symptoms. However, there was no significant difference between the cherry tart group and the placebo group.

Yoga

Another natural alternative to apple cider vinegar is yoga.

A study published in 2013 compared the impact of a 6-week yoga intervention in women with RA. They found that yoga had a range of benefits, including reducing pain and fatigue, while improving quality of life.

Takeaway

Some people find that apple cider vinegar improves their arthritis symptoms, though there is no current research to support its use.

There are some findings to suggest that tart cherry juice could be a good alternative to apple cider vinegar, but further research is needed to confirm this.

A range of other natural approaches, such as yoga could also have benefits for people with arthritis.

Although diluted apple cider vinegar is relatively safe to consume, people with certain conditions, such as diabetes, should talk to their doctor before drinking apple cider vinegar.","antiinflammatory

Read on to discover more about the effectiveness of apple cider vinegar in treating constipation.

Does apple cider vinegar work for constipation?



There is no scientific evidence to suggest that apple cider vinegar can relieve constipation. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that apple cider vinegar can relieve constipation.

Many health websites make claims about how effective apple cider vinegar is. However, there is no scientific evidence to support the theory that apple cider vinegar helps relieve constipation.

Some people believe that apple cider vinegar has this effect because it contains large amounts of pectin, which is a soluble dietary fiber. A lack of fiber is a common cause of constipation.

The acidity of the vinegar may also act as a natural laxative to improve people's digestion.

A 2017 study published in the Natural Product Research journal notes that there is a lack of research on how effective apple cider vinegar is as a home remedy.

The researchers found that apple cider vinegar showed promising antimicrobial effects, but acknowledged that more research is necessary to determine how beneficial it might be for various health conditions.

How to use apple cider vinegar for constipation

As there is very limited clinical evidence to support the use of apple cider vinegar as a treatment, there are no guidelines on dosage. Many people who use apple cider vinegar will drink a small amount on a regular basis when they are constipated.

People should consult a doctor before starting to consume more apple cider vinegar than they would as part of their regular diet.

Some proponents of apple cider vinegar suggest mixing about a tablespoon of the vinegar with a cup of warm water and drinking the mixture up to twice a day to relieve constipation.

Is it safe?

Apple cider vinegar is available as a food product at most grocery stores.

However, there are no studies that indicate how much of this vinegar it is safe to consume.

People who experience adverse side effects after trying apple cider vinegar should avoid having it again.

Apple cider vinegar can interact with various medications and make them less effective. Therefore, people taking medication should always speak to a doctor before using this remedy.

Possible side effects



A possible side effect of apple cider vinegar is gas and bloating. A possible side effect of apple cider vinegar is gas and bloating.

Apple cider vinegar is acidic, which means that it could irritate the stomach, especially in people who have an ulcer or a sensitive stomach.

Some other possible side effects include:

gas and bloating

headaches

acne or skin redness

lower levels of potassium, which can lead to additional symptoms

mouth irritation and tooth damage

Apple cider vinegar may cause additional side effects if it reacts with a medication. People using other medicines should not try apple cider vinegar without discussing it with a doctor first.

Other natural remedies for constipation

The two main causes of constipation are dehydration and inadequate fiber in the diet. Constipation can also arise as a side effect of certain medical conditions and medications.

Drinking plenty of water and eating enough fiber can relieve constipation in many cases.

There are also several potential remedies that people may want to try at home to treat constipation. However, as with apple cider vinegar, there is a lack of research to support some of these remedies.

Natural ways to try relieving constipation include:

using senna, which is an herbal laxative

eating foods that are high in prebiotics, such as garlic

eating more fiber

drinking caffeinated coffee

exercising regularly

eating prunes

avoiding dairy products

taking probiotics, either in foods or as supplements

trying a tailored diet plan for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

People can also use over-the-counter (OTC) laxatives that research has proven to reduce constipation, including magnesium citrate. It is best to consult a doctor before using OTC laxatives.

Outlook

There is insufficient research on apple cider vinegar to confirm its safety and effectiveness as a treatment for constipation.

Some people may find that drinking diluted apple cider vinegar helps them have a bowel movement, but research does not support the effectiveness of this remedy.

People can try a wide range of other natural remedies instead of apple cider vinegar. These include drinking more water and increasing the amount of fiber in the diet.

While fish and seafood are often the primary sources of food allergies, allergies to other types of meat are less common.

Most people with an allergy to chicken will notice mild symptoms and discomfort after eating or touching it. However, some people may develop severe reactions that require medical attention.

In this article, we look at the symptoms and causes of chicken allergies, their link to egg allergies, and how to treat and manage an allergy to chicken.

Chicken allergies and intolerances



Chicken eggs, feathers, or meat may cause an allergic reaction. Chicken eggs, feathers, or meat may cause an allergic reaction.

People can have an allergy or intolerance to chicken meat or other chicken products, including feathers or eggs.

An allergy usually involves more generalized symptoms, such as swelling and rashes, while an intolerance involves digestive issues, such as diarrhea.

Another uncommon condition, known as bird-egg syndrome, occurs when a person eats undercooked or raw egg yolks or inhales feathers or particles from a chicken.

Are chicken allergies common?

Allergic reactions to chicken meat are rare. They can affect both adults and children. They are most often seen in adolescents, though may begin around preschool age.

An allergy to chicken meat may occur as a primary allergy (a true allergy), or as a secondary allergy caused by cross-reactivity with another allergy, such as an allergy to eggs, though this is rare.

Symptoms of a chicken allergy



Coughing is a common symptom of a chicken allergy. Coughing is a common symptom of a chicken allergy.

A chicken allergy can cause symptoms that range in severity. Since it is a rare condition, it is difficult to say what the most common reactions are.

However, people with chicken meat allergies or intolerance may experience the following symptoms after eating or coming into contact with chicken meat:

coughing or wheezing

red, irritated skin

hives

an inflamed or swollen throat

swollen tongue or lips

sneezing

nausea or vomiting

stomach cramps

diarrhea

a sore throat

swollen, watery eyes

In more severe cases, people may experience a dangerous allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:

trouble breathing

heart palpitations

a racing heart

drop in blood pressure

loss of consciousness

wheezing

If a person experiences any of the above symptoms after eating cooked chicken or handling raw chicken, they should get medical attention immediately as anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition.

Can you be allergic to chicken but not eggs?

If a person has a primary allergy to chicken meat, it does not mean they will have an allergy to chicken eggs. In other cases, people may develop a secondary sensitivity to chicken meat as a result of other allergies, such as in bird-egg syndrome.

There are only a few reports of people with a chicken egg allergy and also a chicken meat allergy.

Doctors do not consider people with bird-egg syndrome to have a primary or true chicken meat allergy. These people experience an allergic reaction to a specific protein found in both egg yolks and chickens.

Managing chicken allergies

People with a chicken meat allergy should avoid any contact with raw or cooked chicken meat and unless told otherwise by their doctor, chicken products.

Although not always the case, some people may also need to avoid chicken eggs, especially raw or undercooked eggs. These are present in many products, such as raw cookie dough or batter. Always check the label.

In cases of accidental exposure, people can try over-the-counter antihistamines. Antihistamines can help stop the immune system from overreacting to the chicken.

Anyone experiencing a severe reaction should get medical attention immediately, and use an injectable epinephrine shot, often known by the brand name EpiPen.

Risk factors



A person with a chicken meat allergy may want to avoid pillows that contain feathers. A person with a chicken meat allergy may want to avoid pillows that contain feathers.

A person with a chicken meat allergy may be allergic to other related substances.

People with chicken meat allergies may need to avoid eating some or all of the following:

chicken broth

other chicken products

geese

turkey

fish and shrimp

duck

partridge

pheasant

eggs

They may also need to avoid exposure to chicken feathers and other poultry, including domestic birds.

Some people may choose to avoid certain domestic products, such as feathered-filled pillows.

Some vaccinations, such as yellow fever, contain chicken protein. This can cause an allergic reaction if injected.

People with any food allergy should talk with their doctor about which specific things they need to avoid.

When to see a doctor

People should see their doctor if they experience any symptoms of an allergic reaction up to a couple of hours after eating chicken meat.

Even if the reaction is mild, a doctor can help a person figure out the cause of their symptoms, treat reactions, and plan ways to avoid future contact with allergens.

If a person experiences any of the signs of anaphylaxis, they will require immediate medical attention. After recovering, the person should make a follow-up appointment with their doctor. When a person experiences a severe reaction for the first time, a doctor will prescribe an EpiPen or similar injector.

Outlook

A person can develop a chicken allergy at any age. However, it is not a very common allergy. Allergies to eggs, milk, and other foods are much more widespread.

Many people can manage their allergy by avoiding chicken and other related products. If a person has a severe allergy, they will need immediate emergency medical help. Always schedule a follow-up visit with a primary care doctor.","chicken

Doctors do not fully understand what causes the condition, which complicates the search for a cure.

Crohn's disease is a chronic disorder that can cause irritation and inflammation anywhere along the digestive tract, from the mouth all the way to the anus. It develops most frequently in the colon and small intestine.

According to the American College of Gastroenterology, it is likely that Crohn's disease develops due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. This broad range of factors gives researchers many areas in which to search for a cure.

In this article, we take a look at the current research into a cure for Crohn's disease, as well as the best treatment options that are available at present.

Current research into a cure



Researchers are investigating potential cures for Crohn's disease. Researchers are investigating potential cures for Crohn's disease.

Scientists are currently exploring many different options to try to find a Crohn's disease cure.

Researchers are exploring links between Crohn's disease and a type of bacteria called Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP). These bacteria cause Johne's disease, a chronic inflammation of the digestive tract in cows that has similar effects to Crohn's disease in humans.

MAP bacteria are also more likely to be present in the blood cells of people with Crohn's disease than in those of people who do not have this condition.

If MAP bacteria also cause intestinal inflammation in humans and might lead people to develop Crohn's disease, creating an antibiotic to attack MAP bacteria could have benefits for people with this condition.

Some researchers are using this approach to study a new medication called RHB-104. An earlier study found that people with Crohn's disease who took this antibiotic reported a positive impact on their symptoms after 18 weeks, but no overall positive change after 2 years. Further research is necessary, but the results so far show potential.

Other scientists are exploring the ecology of the human microbiome, which refers to the millions of bacteria that are present throughout the human body and particularly in the digestive tract. One theory is that changes to these bacteria could relate to changes in the gut.

Chronic inflammation is a key aspect of Crohn's disease. As a result, many researchers are interested in exploring the different ways that inflammation develops in the body and finding new techniques to counteract it.

For example, one medication called vedolizumab can specifically prevent white blood cells from attacking the bowel wall. In one study, researchers used vedolizumab to treat people who had not seen any improvement from a standard first-line treatment. The results showed that the drug was no better than a placebo after 6 weeks, but that some benefits occurred after 10 weeks.

Treatment options and latest developments

As there is not yet a cure for Crohn's disease, treatment focuses on:

controlling symptoms

improving the quality of life for people with this condition

keeping complications at bay

It is crucial to start treatment for Crohn's disease as soon as possible after diagnosis. The constant inflammation that accompanies the condition will eventually cause scarring of the bowel walls, which could make medications less effective.

Cramping, diarrhea, fever, and other common symptoms of Crohn's disease result from the body's incurable inflammatory responses. Doctors will describe an individual as being in remission once their inflammation is under control.

The goal of most treatment programs is to achieve remission and maintain it for as long as possible. Remission not only provides relief from the painful, draining symptoms of the disease, but it also gives the intestine walls time to heal.

Treatment plans for Crohn's disease typically include:

Anti-inflammatory medications . Drugs called aminosalicylates, such as sulfasalazine and mesalamine, may be suitable to treat mild-to-moderate cases of the disease.

. Drugs called aminosalicylates, such as sulfasalazine and mesalamine, may be suitable to treat mild-to-moderate cases of the disease. Corticosteroids . It is best to use these drugs only in the short term as they suppress the entire immune system and cause side effects, such as brittle bones. Examples of these medications include prednisone and budesonide.

Doctors may recommend surgical removal of the damaged parts of the gut if serious complications occur, such as blockages or fissures. Surgery may also be necessary when medications are no longer effective.

According to the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, about 70 percent of people with Crohn's disease require surgery at some point. Recurrences are common, affecting up to 60 percent of people within 10 years of the surgery.

Lifestyle and management tips



Tai chi may help manage the symptoms of Crohn's disease. Tai chi may help manage the symptoms of Crohn's disease.

While there is not yet a cure for Crohn's disease, people with this condition may find that certain lifestyle changes can make their symptoms more manageable.

For example, lowering stress levels can help reduce the frequency of flare-ups and make it easier for people to live with their illness.

Living with an inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's can be challenging and stressful at times. As a result, many people with the condition practice a variety of stress reduction techniques, including:

progressive muscle relaxation

diaphragmatic breathing

yoga

tai chi

meditation

biofeedback

cognitive behavioral therapy

Quitting smoking is particularly important for people with Crohn's disease as tobacco use is a controllable risk factor that can make the disease more severe.

Some people with Crohn's disease find it helpful to limit their intake of dairy products, especially if they are intolerant to lactose.

It is best to avoid the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, because these can make Crohn's disease worse in some people.

Outlook

Crohn's disease is a chronic condition. This means that, although it is treatable, there is currently no cure.

The diagnosis of Crohn's disease typically occurs between the ages of 15 and 35. The condition does not usually shorten life expectancy, and most people with Crohn's disease enjoy full and rewarding lives.

Research indicates that the areas of the body where Crohn's disease is active rarely change over time.

However, the progress of the disease is different in every individual. Some people may have long periods of remission while others will experience more frequent flare-ups.

One study found that, over the course of their lifetime, people with Crohn's disease condition spent an average of:

24 percent of the time in remission

27 percent of the time with mild cases of the disease

8 percent of the time with various severe forms of the disease or in surgery

41 percent of the time in remission after surgery

Even though a cure for Crohn's disease remains elusive, researchers have found that once a year has passed since diagnosis, most people begin to spend more time in remission. Many people also see a drop in the frequency of their severe flare-ups.","american college of gastroenterology

The symptoms of a strawberry allergy range from mild to very severe.

Strawberries are a favorite fruit for many Americans. The United States produced an estimated 3 billion pounds of strawberries in 2014 alone. In many areas, strawberries are available all year round in local grocery stores.

Many other foods contain strawberries, and people who are allergic to these berries may also be allergic to other fruits from the same family of plants. While allergic reactions to strawberries tend to be mild, it is possible for people to have a life-threatening response.

In this article, we provide the information that people need to know if they suspect that they have a strawberry allergy.

Can people be allergic to strawberries?



Although it is rare, people can be allergic to strawberries. Although it is rare, people can be allergic to strawberries.

It is possible to be allergic to strawberries, although this allergy is much less common than many other dietary allergies.

Having a strawberry allergy means that a person's immune system reacts badly to a specific protein that is present in this fruit.

Heating strawberries will distort the proteins in them, so some people with a strawberry allergy may be able to eat cooked strawberries.

Doctors do not know how common strawberry allergies are, but, according to a small-scale study conducted in Bosnia, Europe, only 3–4 percent of children aged 2 and under have this allergy. The percentage drops to 0.5–1 percent in late childhood.

Certain foods, including strawberries, citrus fruits, and tomatoes, can cause allergy-like symptoms without a person having a true allergy to them.

People who suspect that they may have a strawberry allergy can discuss their symptoms with a doctor and possibly have an allergy test for confirmation.

Symptoms of a strawberry allergy

When a person has a strawberry allergy, they are likely to experience only mild to moderate symptoms. These symptoms can occur within a few minutes or up to a few hours after eating or coming into contact with strawberries.

The most common symptoms of a strawberry allergy include:

itching and inflammation of the throat and mouth

itchy skin

hives

coughing and wheezing

dizziness or lightheadedness

diarrhea

vomiting

a feeling of tightness in the throat

congestion

On rare occasions, strawberries can cause a life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. The symptoms of anaphylaxis are severe and can include:

a rapid pulse rate

a swollen tongue

a swollen throat that blocks the airway

a substantial drop in blood pressure

dizziness and lightheadedness

fainting

It is vital to get immediate medical care for anyone showing signs of anaphylaxis. People with a severe allergy should always carry an EpiPen, which is an injectable medication that counteracts a severe allergic reaction.

Treating and managing a strawberry allergy



Check the labels on foods to ensure that they do not contain strawberries. Check the labels on foods to ensure that they do not contain strawberries.

In most cases, people can treat allergic reactions to strawberries at home with no medical intervention.

The best treatment for an allergy is to avoid the allergen altogether. For people with a strawberry allergy, this means avoiding:

fresh strawberries

dried strawberries

jams that contain strawberries

strawberry jellies

strawberry candies

Always check the labels on foods to make sure that they do not contain strawberries.

People can often treat mild reactions at home using over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines. Antihistamines will stop the immune system from overreacting to the strawberries and will help prevent the symptoms or reduce their severity.

However, if this is the first time that someone is experiencing an allergic reaction, they should speak to their doctor for advice on symptom management and possible treatment options.

For severe reactions, people need emergency medical attention. Anyone with a known severe allergy should carry an EpiPen at all times in case of accidental exposure to an allergen.

Risk factors

People have a higher risk of food allergies if they have the following:

a family history of food allergies

a birch pollen allergy

asthma

eczema

Young children may have a higher risk of developing an allergy to a particular food if they do not get exposure to it early in life. The introduction of some foods, such as strawberries, later in life can sometimes trigger an allergic reaction.

When to see a doctor

People should see a doctor after their first allergic reaction to strawberries and stop eating this fruit immediately. It is also essential not to feed strawberries to children who have an allergic reaction after consuming or coming into contact with the fruit.

During the visit, the doctor will ask the person questions about their symptoms and medical history to rule out other factors and causes.

They may also perform one or more tests to determine whether or not strawberries are the cause of the symptoms. Typical tests include:

blood tests

skin prick tests

an elimination test, in which people avoid the food and see if their symptoms improve

Doctors should reevaluate the person for the allergy every few years. Some people will outgrow their allergy.

What to avoid if you have a strawberry allergy



People with a strawberry allergy may also react to raspberries and blackberries. People with a strawberry allergy may also react to raspberries and blackberries.

A person who is allergic to strawberries may find that they have issues with other potential allergens.

Strawberries belong to the Rosaceae family of fruit. People with a strawberry allergy may need to avoid other fruits from this family, which include:

apples

cherries

raspberries

peaches

blackberries

People with a strawberry allergy may also react to:

latex

birch pollen

apricots

melon

bananas

some nuts, such as hazelnuts

celery

carrots

Outlook

Strawberry allergies are relatively uncommon and tend to cause only a mild or moderate reaction.

However, some people may develop a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that requires emergency medical attention.

In some cases, it is possible to outgrow an allergy. For people who do not, the best treatment is to avoid the fruit and other fruits from the same family.","strawberry

(Gary Hershorn/Reuters)

The Palestinians need to stop making war before their conflict with Israel can be resolved.

There’s a Bob Newhart sketch you probably know: A woman walks into a therapist’s office and says that her life is being spoiled because she spends all of her time obsessing over the fearful possibility that she will be buried alive in a box. His advice:

“Stop it!”

She’s resistant, and lists her other problems:

“I’m bulimic. I put my finger down my throat and—”

“Stop it!”

Advertisement

“I have self-destructive relationships with men.”

“Stop it!”

Advertisement

Advertisement

Etc.

There is a great deal of wisdom in that. Jay Nordlinger likes to tell a story about “B-1 Bob” Dornan, the Republican congressman from California. He was a famously tough guy, an Air Force captain who survived two parachute bailouts in the Fifties and registered black voters in Mississippi in the Sixties. He said the hardest thing he ever did was quit smoking. But it’s the easiest thing in the world to do: You just stop it. Drinking, drugs, eating junk food — giving any of those up is a purely negative achievement. You just don’t do it anymore. Simple. “Simple as a flower, and that’s a complicated thing.”

This week marks 25 years since the Rose Garden ceremony celebrating the signing of the Oslo Accords. You’ll remember the famous picture of a beaming President Bill Clinton kind of shoving PLO terrorist Yasser Arafat and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin toward each other to shake hands.

Like many of the purported victories of the Clinton administration, that moment of triumph has not aged very well. As Herb Keinon writes in the Jerusalem Post:

The longed-for peace still tarries, the New Middle East of Shimon Peres, one of the architects and leading proponent of the Oslo Accords, never emerged. In fact, some argue that the handshake 25 years ago did not improve the chances of peace between Arabs and Israelis, but actually — because it raised and then dashed hopes — pushed them farther away. A quarter-century since the formal kickoff of the Oslo process, peace between the two sides has rarely felt more distant.

A peace plan isn’t peace. Peace negotiations aren’t peace. Nobel Peace Prizes aren’t peace, either, though they were handed out after Oslo.

Peace is peace.

And war is war: There were 169 Palestinian suicide attacks between 1993 and 2016, targeting shopping malls, bus depots, the streets of downtown Jerusalem. In 2014 alone, there were 4,500 rocket and mortar attacks on Israelis. The Palestinians still proudly celebrate their stunning military victory over a pregnant woman, seven children, and five other civilians eating pizza at the Battle of Sbarro. There is constant violence on the Gaza border, and balloons and kites now are used to deliver incendiary devices into Israeli cities. There are practically no diplomatic relationships between the Israeli government and the Palestinian government, partly because the Palestinians have two competing governments run by two competing terrorist organizations: Fatah in the West bank and Hamas in Gaza. The United States government has announced that it will cease funding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), and an Israeli newspaper reported that the Trump administration, through Jared Kushner and his representative Jason Greenblatt, had offered the Palestinians $5 billion to come to the negotiating table again — a claim Greenblatt denies. President Trump has suggested that he’ll rely on financial leverage to motivated the Palestinians, telling reporters: “I’d say, ‘You’ll get money, but we’re not paying you until we make a deal. If we don’t make a deal, we’re not paying.’”

Another deal. One cannot fault the administration for trying. What else is there to do?

If only Secretary of State Bob Newhart were here to offer the Palestinians some sound advice: “Stop it.”

The conflict in Israel might be settled 1 million different ways, but Palestinian powers reject 999,999 of those possibilities in favor of the one outcome that the Israelis cannot accept: the elimination of the Jewish state as such. To the extent that the Palestinian powers have the consent of the people they purport to rule, this is what is being consented to: war and more war, misery and more misery, with the Palestinians themselves suffering some of the worst of it. But the Israelis cannot make peace with people who will not make peace with them. They can only do what they have tried to do: protect themselves and look for harm-reduction opportunities.

There is plenty of valid criticism of the Israeli government under Benjamin Netanyahu and others, of the Israeli Right, and even of Israeli society at large. No politician, no administration, and no government is without its own interests distinct from those of the people in whose service they are employed. If there were an Olympics of finger-pointing, the world’s commentators on Middle Eastern affairs would have all the gold medals. But whatever you make of all that, the facts have to be taken into consideration: The Israeli state exists, and the Palestinian state, thank goodness, does not, being as it is barely more than a dangerous hypothesis. A state is a weapon as fearsome as a nuclear missile, and one can guess what the Palestinians would try to do with one, if they had one that worked.

It may be the case that Chemi Shalev is correct when he writes in Haaretz that Netanyahu et al. never gave Oslo a chance:

After demolishing the Oslo agreements, [Netanyahu] is now working to deplete the mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO and its role as the representative of the Palestinian people as a whole. He ignores Mahmoud Abbas, refusing to make even a minimal effort to earn his trust. He is willing to contemplate de facto recognition of Hamas rule in Gaza, a move that would undermine the Palestinian Authority’s claim, as heir and arm of the PLO, to represent the Palestinian as a whole; His aides have even been heard to whisper in Trump officials’ ears about the desirability of making the separation permanent by linking the future of Gaza to Egypt and the West Bank’s, in one form or another, to Jordan. With the active assistance of the Trump administration, Netanyahu is also endeavoring to eradicate the very concept of a Palestinian diaspora and its refugees, a move that would subvert the very raison d’etre for the PLO’s existence in the first place.

This is meant to be an indictment. What it sounds like to me is a pretty good program, because the fundamental “raison d’etre for the PLO’s existence” is making war on Israel, whatever strategic pauses or rhetorical innovations it comes up with. And there will not be peace until the Palestinians stop making war. Whatever your politics, whatever your analysis of the situation, however you apportion blame — that is the fact.

Israel has been under assault from the moment of its foundation. The 25th anniversary of the Oslo agreement is just one more milestone, marking a quarter century in which Israel has continued to grow and thrive in spite of the rockets falling on it, a quarter century in which the Palestinians have not learned how to make anything other than war.

In the Seventh Congressional District, a victory for Lizzie Fletcher might be an early tremor of a political earthquake.

Houston — Nationally, the Democratic party, which gave indispensable assistance (“Basket of deplorables”!) to the election of today’s president, seems intent (“Impeach!”; “Abolish ICE!”; “Free stuff!”; “I am Spartacus!”) on a repeat performance. Here, however, in the Seventh Congressional District, in what might turn out to be the year’s most instructive House race, Democrats seem serious about winning, and if they do with Lizzie Fletcher, they will have a template for 2020 nationally.

One of her handouts inexplicably describes her as a “fierce advocate,” as though Americans are experiencing a fierceness deficit and pine for a ferocity infusion. Actually, she speaks with the measured precision of an attorney who has worked at a major law firm (Vinson & Elkins) and who is fluent in the business-school patois (“The delta last time was . . .”) of her corporate clients. The ginger group Our Revolution, which is a residue of Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign, supported a candidate to her left in the seven-candidate primary, perhaps because Fletcher would not genuflect at the requisite altars: She has endorsed neither a single-payer health-care system nor Medicare for all nor putting lipstick on socialism, least of all a ban — this is Texas, for Pete’s sake — on off-shore drilling.

In New York and then in Massachusetts, two ten-term House incumbents, both males, have been defeated in primaries by females running to the incumbents’ left in safe Democratic districts. Here, in a district held by Republicans for the past half-century, a woman is not far behind — in some polls, within the margin of error — the Republican incumbent.

A fifth-generation Houstonian, Fletcher is striving to become just the fourth person to represent the current iteration of the Seventh District, which she describes as “leaning purple but still light pink.” It was reconfigured in 1966, when it was won by 42-year-old George Herbert Walker Bush, who still lives in it. After his two terms, it was held for 15 terms by Bill Archer, who rose to the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee. His successor, John Culberson, 62, wants to “let Texans run Texas” but is not a conscientious objector to non-Texas money he can send home from his perch on the Appropriations Committee. His conservatism had a Trumpian tang six years before Trump came down his tower’s escalator: In 2009, Culberson co-sponsored a “birther” bill that would have required presidential candidates to prove that they are natural-born citizens. A legislative lifer, Culberson won the first of seven two-year terms in the state house in 1986 at age 30. He won his 2016 congressional reelection with 56 percent of the vote.

If the best kind of generals are lucky ones, Fletcher, 43, is that kind of candidate. The tight Senate race between incumbent Ted Cruz and Democratic representative Beto O’Rourke, who has already visited all 254 Texas counties, is apt to energize Democratic turnout statewide. Culberson perhaps did nothing untoward when he sold a biotech stock — the one concerning which Representative Chris Collins, (R., N.Y.) has been indicted for insider trading — ten days before the shares lost 99 percent of their value, but the optics are not optimal. And while their city was still prostrate from Hurricane Harvey, Houstonians heard the president’s stupefying statement that the Coast Guard had to save 16,000 people because they “went out in their boats to watch the hurricane.”

It has been a while since Texas was, in Gene Autry’s lyric, “Where the longhorn cattle feed/On the lowly gypsum weed.” It is the 15th-most urban state (84.7 percent), with the nation’s fourth-, seventh-, ninth-, eleventh-, and 15th-most populous cities (Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, and Fort Worth). Hillary Clinton mopped the floor with Donald Trump in nearly all, which is one reason Trump carried 21 states by larger margins than his nine-percentage-point victory in Texas.

Advertisement

A Fletcher victory might be an early tremor of a political earthquake. In presidential politics, Democrats have three large, safe states — California, New York, and Illinois — with a combined 104 electoral votes, 38.5 percent of 270. Texas, the Republicans’ only such state, today has 38 electoral votes and after the 2020 census will have two, perhaps three, more. If it turns purple, every year divisible by four will be, for Republicans, a year of living dangerously.

Nationally, Fletcher’s party seems determined to emulate Yasser Arafat’s description of the PLO: They never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Here the party seems serious about winning.

Panos Cosmatos’s Mandy is a low-budget but extremely high-impact tour de force.

‘You should go in knowing that your odds aren’t that good. And you will probably die.” So warned, Nicolas Cage heads into the inferno in Mandy, a barnburner of a midnight movie set in a dreamlike forest primeval that has become the host to an LSD-crazed biker gang of Jesus freaks with bad intentions. It is, we are told at the outset, “The Shadow Mountains, A.D. 1983.”

The cry going around the critical schoolyard is that, on the strength of this spectacularly bloody and nerve-filleting horror flick, “Nicolas Cage is back.” This is quite wrong. Cage never went anywhere (he’s had 14 movie credits just since 2016, mostly in schlocky genre movies) and his typically gonzo performance is the weakest aspect of Mandy (which is being released in a few theaters and via video-on-demand). You can see what attracted him to the film: the opportunity to, for instance, have a screaming fit while seated on a toilet in his tighty-whities, pouring vodka all over his many wounds and down his throat. And few among us could turn down a script that offers a chance for the leading man to light his cigarette from the flaming corpse of an enemy freshly vanquished. Although Cage can still exercise restraint as an actor (see, for instance, 2013’s Joe), his instinct is to overplay drama to such a hysterical degree that he’s essentially winking at himself and inviting the audience to have a giggle.

No, Cage is not the story here. Someone else is: the film’s mad-genius co-writer and director Panos Cosmatos. The next time you hear his name, I expect it will be attached to a much bigger picture than this low-budget but extremely high-impact tour de force.

The surname may be familiar: Cosmatos, who lives in Vancouver, is the son of the late George P. Cosmatos, who directed Tombstone and Rambo: First Blood Part II. The younger man’s only previous film, Beyond the Black Rainbow, was released in 2010. It took eight years to get this one made. With Mandy we see an artist in full flower, albeit a flower that spurts blood. Eyeballs get gouged. Cage gets an arterial spray in his face (causing him to, of course, laugh maniacally). The film is way too sanguinary to achieve an R rating, hence its being released unrated. If simulated gore bothers you, well, I believe the new Mamma Mia movie is still playing.

Using nothing more elaborate than basic A/V club tricks such as colored filters and slow motion, Cosmatos creates a lush, eerie sylvan dreamscape where Red Miller (Cage) lives a life of idyllic stillness with his lady, Mandy (Andrea Riseborough). Cosmatos’s imagery is hypnotic, made even more gripping by a musical score from the late Icelander Johann Johannsson, whose last film this is. Johansson engineers a sound reminiscent of early-’80s synthesizer-based scores laced with slow-acting poison: long, slow chords of dread and foreboding. Then, a title flashes on the screen: In a demented heavy-metal font suggesting the cover of a Motley Crue album, we learn that the Children of the New Dawn have arrived. They’re a freaky Christian cult in a van led by a lunatic would-be messiah (Linus Roache).

Like many others in the post–Quentin Tarantino generation of filmmakers, Cosmatos revels in the lowbrow thrills of 1970s-style drive-in movies even as he’s slyly mocking their conventions with operatic exaggeration. Red doesn’t just fight back, he tracks down a prophetic old man in a trailer (a superb Bill Duke, underplaying nicely against Cage’s theatrics) and announces, “I came for . . . the Reaper.” The old man has some suggestions for other weaponry, such as an item that can “cut through bone like a fat kid through cake.” Red doesn’t just assemble his medieval armaments, he forges them. In an actual forge. (I don’t know why he has a forge either, or where the tiger came from: Don’t take things overly literally, we’re in a land of the murky red subconscious.) Cosmatos has said one of his inspirations was the 1982 film The Sword and the Sorcerer, so Cage is his reckless, relentless knight. But in style the film carries more of a hazy David Lynch aura, caught between reality and myth.

Though many filmmakers share Tarantino’s fondness for exploitation cinema, few share his subtle wit or his gift for arch dialogue. Cosmatos does, and like Tarantino he has so many great ideas some get relegated to the background. I loved Mandy’s freaky parody of a 1980s kiddie commercial, starring a dyspeptic goblin, seemingly a reference to the strange historical moment when there was a breakfast cereal named for the homicidal imps of Gremlins. Mandy is, like that weird little goblin, a thing of demon energy and murderous concentration, eager to get on with the business of messing with you. It’s one of the wildest, weirdest, most exciting movies of the year.

Unseal the FISA redactions? We should be alarmed by what’s already disclosed

Will this be the week? With bated breath, we wait to find out whether we’ve reached the moment, after the Labor Day end of summer, just as the critical midterm races heat up, when President Trump will follow through on his threat to declassify and publicize key FISA-gate documents — in particular, the redacted portions of the Carter Page surveillance-warrant applications.

I hope the president follows through, at least to the extent he can do so without putting intelligence methods and sources at risk. Accountability is essential here.

The FBI and the Obama Justice Department launched an investigation of the Democrats’ political adversaries, and they used Clinton-campaign-generated, foreign-provided innuendo to do it. They strained to make a case on Donald Trump even as they were burying a daunting criminal case on Mrs. Clinton. As I have previously explained, moreover, the president was misled about his status: not only was he a suspect in the investigation, he was the main suspect.

The main suspect in an investigation with no crime.

Before we unwind that, let’s dispense with the tired claim that the Obama administration did not really spy on Trump and his campaign. Every one of the four FISA warrant applications, after describing Russia’s cyberespionage attack on the 2016 election, makes the following assertion (after two redacted lines):

the FBI believes that the Russian Government’s efforts [to influence the 2016 election] were being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Candidate #1’s campaign.

“Candidate #1” is Trump. See, the upper hierarchies of the FBI and the Justice Department believed the Steele dossier — or at least they said they did. The operating assumption of the Obama administration in the months before the 2016 election was that the Trump campaign was complicit in the Kremlin’s hacking conspiracy. Otherwise, the FBI would not have made this representation to the FISA court four times, including twice after President Trump was already in office.

Did they say this because they believed it was true? Because they wanted to believe it was true? Because they had misplaced confidence in Christopher Steele, the former British spy who shared their anti-Trump contempt? Probably a bit of all those things. But the point is: You must always bear in mind that the incumbent leadership of the intelligence community had convinced itself that the Trump campaign was in cahoots with the Kremlin. Based on that belief, the FBI and Obama’s DOJ took bold risks because they’d further convinced themselves that there was no risk at all: Everything was in the black box of classified intelligence and, besides, Hillary was a shoo-in to win. No one would ever be any the wiser.

FISA Collection Will Be “Evaluated by Prosecutive Authorities”

Let’s shift our attention to the redacted Carter Page FISA warrant applications. While we anticipate that the president is poised to force disclosure of currently blacked-out information, not enough attention has been lavished on the applications in their present state — figuring out what’s been blacked out and, more significantly, grasping the ramifications of what has been disclosed.

Advertisement

I have dealt with the redactions in a separate column. The vast majority of them — the bulk of the 412 largely duplicative pages of FISA warrant documents — are really not that hard to figure out. More importantly, most of the redactions have nothing to do with what really matters: the evidence on which the FBI relied to claim that there was probable cause that Carter Page was an agent of Russia.

Here, let’s stick with the essential point: The use of counterintelligence authorities to conduct a criminal investigation of Donald Trump in the absence of a predicate crime.

Advertisement

We’ve had a lot to say about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s failure to comply with federal regulations that require showing a factual basis for a criminal investigation — i.e., reason to believe that a crime was committed — before appointing a special counsel, Robert Mueller. But Rosenstein was just riding the tide. The FISA warrants show that this practice of launching a criminal investigation in the absence of a crime long predated Rosenstein and Mueller. It was the modus operandi of the Trump-Russia investigation from Day One, when Obama’s Justice Department and the FBI first targeted the Trump campaign.

Advertisement

This raises a question that should gnaw at those of us (like moi) who have championed robust national-security powers in an era dominated by international terrorism: Is this pretextual use of FISA something that the Justice Department and FBI designed specifically for the Trump-Russia investigation, or is it standard operating procedure in all counterintelligence cases? (We can’t answer that question at the moment. FISA warrant documents are highly classified, which is why it’s been so hard to get even partial disclosure regarding the Trump-Russia investigation; we do not know if FISA warrants in other cases mirror the ones we’ve been permitted to see.)

Let’s cut to the chase. Every one of the four Page warrant applications makes the following assertion (the italics are mine):

The Purpose of the Authorities Requested

The FBI’s foreign intelligence goals for this investigation are set forth in the certification of the Executive Branch official contained herein. However, the authorities requested in this application may produce information and material which might, when evaluated by prosecutive authorities, constitute evidence of a violation of United States law, and this investigation may result in an eventual criminal prosecution of the target. Nevertheless, as discussed in the certification, at least a significant purpose of this request for [REDACTED] is to collect foreign intelligence information as part of the FBI’s investigation of this target.

This is so matter-of-factly brazen, buried on page 41 of the 54-page application, that we can easily miss its significance.

Exception for Inadvertent Discovery of Criminal Evidence

FISA authorities are not criminal-law authorities. It is not just that FISA is not designed to ferret out evidence of crime; it is not permitted to be used for that purpose. FISA’s objective is the collection of foreign intelligence, the gathering of information about the actions and intentions of foreign powers that may threaten American interests.

The Page warrant application implies that it is a standard part of the process that “prosecutive authorities” — i.e., prosecutors, criminal investigators, grand juries — peruse FISA evidence to determine whether crimes have been committed. Not true. Prosecutors normally have nothing to do with FISA. Counterintelligence is not “prosecutive”; it aims to gather information about other countries and their operatives, not make criminal cases.

There is an exception. It is not unique to FISA; it is a common-sense exception that applies across the board in federal law: If investigators are conducting a legitimate investigation, and they unexpectedly stumble upon evidence of a crime, they are not required to ignore it even if it wasn’t what they were looking for in the first place.

Some examples. If a federal agency is soliciting contract bids and a bid comes in that is patently fraudulent, it can be referred to criminal investigators. If the FBI is doing a background check for a woman who has applied for a federal job, and agents discover she has committed bank fraud, the Bureau will refer that for prosecution. If an FBI agent is executing a search warrant permitting him to seize guns with obliterated serial numbers, and he happens to find a bag of cocaine on the premises, he may seize the drugs and the culprit will be prosecuted on narcotics charges. And if, while conducting a lawful FISA surveillance, the FBI discovers that the suspected agents of a foreign power are plotting to blow up a building, that evidence may be handed over to criminal investigators for a terrorism prosecution.

There is nothing remarkable about this exception. Everybody knows about it. It would never be spelled out in a normal search warrant. Prosecutors and agents do not write in their warrant applications, “If the premises contain incriminating materials other than that which the court has authorized seizure of, the FBI may seize those materials”; if they wrote this, it would be suggestive of an unconstitutional “general warrant” — it would intimate that the government’s real agenda was to find evidence beyond what they had probable cause to search for. Similarly, it is not necessary in a FISA warrant application to spell out the exception for good-faith, unintended discovery of criminal evidence. Doing so strongly suggests the FBI and DOJ realize that they are conducting a de facto criminal investigation. It suggests that they are pretextually using FISA, because they either lack grounds to justify a criminal wiretap application (which requires probable cause of a crime), or desire to conceal their criminal probe under the cover of classified intelligence. It suggests that the overarching objective is to make a criminal case, not to collect foreign intelligence.

Using Counterintelligence to “Assess Whether Crimes Were Committed”

It is worth noting that we don’t just find this wayward approach in the FISA applications. It sings aloud in the breathtaking testimony of the FBI’s then-director, James Comey, before the House Intelligence Committee on March 20, 2017 (my italics):

I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts. As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.



Put aside that it is against Justice Department and FBI protocols to confirm the existence of an investigation and to identify as suspects uncharged persons or entities (“individuals associated with the Trump campaign”). It is simply not the case that every counterintelligence investigation includes “an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.” Most counterintelligence investigations have no interest in crimes. Rather, in any random investigation, if evidence of a crime the investigators were not looking for happens to turn up, an assessment is then made of whether it should be referred for prosecution. This assessment is not supposed to be built into the process because it is extraordinary — the purpose of FISA is not supposed to be to build a criminal case. That’s why very few criminal cases include FISA evidence.

Director Comey’s testimony echoes the assertion in the FISA warrants about having “prosecutive authorities” weigh in. And Comey’s testimony was expressly incorporated in Rosenstein’s appointment of Mueller. The special counsel was given the counterintelligence investigation of Russia. That investigation itself was real, but its assignment to Mueller was camouflage, because a counterintelligence investigation does not need a prosecutor. For Mueller, the Russia counterintelligence probe was cover to conduct a criminal investigation of Trump in the absence of grounds to believe a crime had occurred.

The Wall: Preventing Abusive Pretextual Use of FISA

Maybe this seems like a hypertechnical point. It is not — certainly not if you lived through the 1990s.

Back then, in the eight years between the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and 9/11, al-Qaeda repeatedly attacked the United States. The government struggled to decide whether international terrorism was strictly a criminal matter, to be investigated with such techniques as criminal wiretaps, or a national-security matter, to be investigated under FISA and other intelligence-gathering procedures.

Obviously, it was both. But that caused the Clinton Justice Department sleepless nights over what seemed — to me, among other terrorism prosecutors and investigators — to be overwrought fears of hypothetical abuses remote from real-world experience.

I guess I owe Jamie Gorelick an apology.

The then–deputy attorney general and other Clinton DOJ officials were worried about FISA. What if you had a rogue agent who was predisposed to believe a suspect was guilty, but couldn’t prove it? The rogue agent did not have enough evidence to seek a regular wiretap or search warrant. Mightn’t the rogue be tempted to use FISA? He’d just need to claim that there was some vague national-security aspect to the case; to pretend that his investigation was connected to a broader counterintelligence investigation of a foreign power. The rogue agent could then seek a FISA warrant to surveil the suspect. He would call it “counterintelligence,” but in reality he’d be conducting a criminal investigation — eavesdropping and searching suspects — even though he did not have probable cause to believe a crime had been committed.

Based on this fear that FISA could be used pretextually to conduct criminal investigations, the Clinton Justice Department imposed “The Wall.” To prevent investigators from exploiting FISA to steer criminal investigations, a barrier was imposed between the FBI’s counterintelligence agents, on one side, and criminal investigators and prosecutors, on the other. It became practically impossible for the two sides to cooperate and share information.

Advertisement

One result was the desired clamping down on potential FISA abuse. But the cure proved worse than the disease. With counterintelligence and criminal investigators unable to build a mosaic of intelligence, the left hand no longer knew what the right hand was doing. This enabled terrorists to escape detection. Inevitably, catastrophes would occur, such as 9/11.

After 9/11, The Wall came down. Its razing was endorsed by such experienced hands as your humble correspondent. We argued that it was ridiculous to believe the FBI would pretextually use FISA to conduct a criminal investigation. Many times I posited that, even if we assume a rogue agent, it would be far easier for the rogue to fabricate the evidence needed to get a criminal wiretap than to fabricate a national-security angle so he could use FISA. I insisted that if the rogue tried to go the FISA route, he’d never get away with it. FISA requires too many levels of scrutiny in the upper ranks of the FBI and the Justice Department — responsible superiors who would stop the rogue in his tracks.

I was wrong.

What I didn’t factor in was the possibility that, for political reasons, the upper ranks of the FBI and Justice Department would do an investigation by themselves. That should never happen. The bosses are supposed to be the cooler heads, with detachment from on-the-ground investigation. They are there to enforce guidelines and prevent abuse, to police investigations, not conduct them.

But in the Trump investigation, headquarters became the investigator. And just as an investigator is tempted to keep his supervisors in the dark when he is doing something he shouldn’t do, the Obama Justice Department and FBI withheld information about the Trump investigation from Congress — even though the “Gang of Eight” was supposed to receive quarterly briefings on sensitive matters. They withheld essential information from the FISA court about the source of their information (the Clinton campaign), and about the apparent dishonesty and deep bias of their main witness (Christopher Steele), even as they presented unverified allegations to the FISA court, flouting FBI guidelines. Headquarters exists to prevent investigators, who sometimes get too invested in their cases, from cutting such corners. But here, headquarters was its own supervisor. Such arrangements tend not to end well.

Do They Do This All the Time, or Just for the Trump Investigation?

The Wall was removed to promote information-sharing and thus prevent terrorist attacks. Yet its removal did not change the fundamental rules. If agents have a factual basis to believe a crime has been or is being committed, the FBI opens a criminal investigation and uses criminal authorities. If, instead, the main purpose of the investigation is to gather foreign intelligence, the FBI opens a counterintelligence investigation and may use FISA. It remains improper to make pretextual use of FISA to conduct a criminal investigation when there is no factual basis to believe a crime has been committed. Yes, if agents conducting a good-faith FISA investigation incidentally discover evidence of a crime, they are not required to ignore it; but this sensible rule is not a license to conduct a FISA investigation with the objective of unearthing criminal evidence.

Advertisement

Yet, that is what happened in the Trump probe. The FBI has been investigating for well over two years, and for nine months of that time it expressly told the FISA court it believed the Trump campaign was engaged in a corrupt conspiracy with Russia. No one, though, has ever been charged with such a heinous offense. Meanwhile, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein persists in his refusal to identify any crime for which there was such a strong basis to believe Trump could be guilty that a special counsel had to be appointed.

If there were such a crime, we would have been told about it by now. The “factual” basis for suspecting Trump of an espionage conspiracy with Russia was the uncorroborated, unverifiable Steele dossier. The Obama Justice Department and the FBI used the dossier to get FISA warrants, and in so doing told the court that “prosecutive authorities” would “evaluate” the “foreign intelligence” in a hunt for crimes.

The Justice Department and the FBI know they are not permitted to use FISA as a pretext. If I were a member of Congress, I’d be asking them whether this promise of “prosecutive” review in the Page warrant application (a) was unique to the Trump investigation or (b) is invoked whenever the FBI seeks a FISA warrant.

Either way, it’s a problem. Either way, it harms the country. If the public becomes convinced that national-security powers, such as those in FISA, are being employed to monitor Americans when there is insufficient evidence to justify a criminal investigation, there will be demands to strip these powers. And those of us who have insisted through the years that, with responsible supervision by the top tiers of the Justice Department and the Bureau, the government can be trusted not to abuse these powers, will have nothing to say.

Editors’ note: This column has been corrected since it was first posted. A quotation from the FISA application has been corrected to reflect that a bracketed passage — “to influence the 2016 election were” — was inserted by the author. The brackets were inadvertently omitted; the bracketed passage accurately summarizes the prior pages of the FBI’s application.

The arguments for doing the converse are getting a little silly.

If you’re a long-time Republican voter, you’ve likely by now heard the growing and insistent and highly concerned media refrain: Republicans who truly care about America will vote for Democrats this fall.

In RealClearPolitics last month, columnist Froma Harrop addressed the woes of Republicans in the age of Trump, offering her take on the only honorable options for this fall: “You can follow the lead of GOP strategist Steve Schmidt, conservative columnist George Will and others who have fled the party. Or you can stay in and help a Democratic sweep of Congress, with the aim of regrouping afterward. Sending good but spineless Republicans to Washington would only extend the nation’s agony.”

In the end, she argues, “the anti-Trump Republicans’ only hope at the moment is a massive repudiation of Trumpism at the polls.”

Many smart people have made this point, and will likely continue to do so as we edge closer to November. But as someone who has voted for Republicans her entire life — with the exception of our current president — I have a few questions. First of all, what about sending good Republicans with spines to Washington? There are plenty of them on the ballot all across the country. Also, is the nation really in constant “agony,” or does that state of mind apply just to a particular swath of journalists? Further, it seems rather odd that I would vote for people who have explicitly promised me they will energetically oppose most of my policy preferences. I may not have voted for Trump in 2016, but I sure as heck didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton, either.

But ah, the specter of “Trumpism.” It is a mysterious and powerful thing! I see endless commentary about it online, but I don’t see a lot of it in real life. I don’t know about you, but I don’t know many people who are absolutely 100 percent all-in bananas about Donald Trump. I do know a whole lot of people who are convinced that the political Left — a movement that recently inspired former president Jimmy Carter to warn against hard-core progressive overreach — is far worse. Weirdly, instead of acting like reasonable moderates, Democrats across the board seem to be doing their best to convince people that this is so.

Take the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh. If you watched the hearings, I’m sure you were impressed by the show of sober thinking, judicious inquiry, and complete lack of unhinged panic. Just kidding! Democrats turned the confirmations into such a circus that even left-wing hero Ruth Bader Ginsburg labeled it a “highly partisan show.”

Advertisement

Senator Kamala Harris, often portrayed as a bright young star of the Democratic party, launched an online panic with an edited video suggesting that Kavanaugh was deviously planning on “going after birth control,” which sounds very radical indeed. It is here is where I should probably point out that it has been largely Republicans, not Democrats, who have pushed to move birth control to more accessible over-the-counter status, but never mind. That’s not exciting. What is exciting, apparently, is to tell America that it’s The Handmaid’s Tale all the way down.

Next, somewhat hilariously, our old friend Hillary Clinton picked up Harris’s tale of terror, but only after it had already been factually shot down by both PolitiFact and the Washington Post. Kavanaugh, she tweeted, “made it clear that safe and legal abortion isn’t the only fundamental reproductive right at grave risk if he is confirmed. Access to birth control is, too.”

Despite being corrected and challenged about these untrue statements approximately one million times online, at press time both Harris’s and Clinton’s tweets are still up there on the World Wide Web, the very definition of fake news, for all the universe to see. How can this be? I’ve been told that only Trump does that! Democrats, you must stop this wild erosion of our nation’s storied and dignified D.C. norms — feel free to snort derisively here — and vote for a full slate of Republicans in the fall!

Advertisement

You can see how this is getting a little silly.

The final argument you’ll see for voting for Democrats in November is what I’ll call the “adults in the room” thesis. Under this argument, if Democrats take the House — please read the rest of this sentence in a serious and imposing professor voice — the current “chaos” in Washington, D.C., will fade, a mature “check” on the executive will emerge, and a new sense of calm will prevail. I don’t really have much to say about this except to refer you to watch the video of the Kavanaugh hearings again, which might make you laugh until you cry.

Or take a look at the cynical cloak-and-dagger tactics displayed this week by Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sat on a letter from an anonymous woman accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in high school, refused to address it fairly during the confirmation hearings, and then leaked it to the media after turning it in to the FBI, promptly setting the Internet on fire. “We couldn’t understand what their rationale is for not briefing members on this,” a congressional source told The New Yorker. “This is all very weird.” Indeed. But hey, at least it’s been handled in a completely mature and straightforward and judicious manner, right? (Insert a very jaded narrator voice here: It has not.)

Advertisement

Anyway, things are what they are. It’s still a free country, despite one thousand breathless headlines implying otherwise, and you can vote how you want. (As you can probably guess, I will most decidedly not be swinging left this year.) I’ll add one final note against the great “vote for Democrats to save the Republicans” trope: It presumes that people actually learn things quickly in politics. If that were true, a huge and growing swath of Americans would be voting relentlessly to get government — and those “storied D.C. norms” — less involved in our lives. Amazingly, we’re not quite yet there.

The public cares about products far more than politics.

In our present, politicized age, we’re seeing two things happen at once. First, multiple major corporations have stripped away any pretense of neutrality and are now openly on the progressive side of American political debates. Second, the vast majority of those corporations have paid no meaningful price for their progressive activism.

Just ask Nike.

Days after it announced a multi-million-dollar deal with Colin Kaepernick, prompting a minor stock dip and a torrent of stories detailing how foolish the company was to “alienate half its customer base,” its stock gained back all the losses and it was reported that its sales had actually “skyrocketed” in the days after it launched its campaign.

If you followed the online debate the announcement touched off, you might ask: How can this be? Conservatives seemed furious. People cut up their socks and burned their shoes. Nike had openly flouted Michael Jordan’s famous (and probably apocryphal) warning that “Republicans buy sneakers, too,” and it had lived to tell the tale.

Yet If you think carefully and systematically about America’s cultural and economic realities, you shouldn’t be surprised that Nike could survive and even thrive amid a political storm of its own creation.

While America is divided politically, religiously, and ideologically, only a small fraction of Democrats and Republicans pay close attention to political news cycles. And only an even smaller fraction of that small fraction cares enough about politics to actually adjust its buying decisions or sacrifice even a little bit to send a political message.

If you’re reading this piece, you’re already among the most politically engaged citizens in the entire nation. Be honest, how many of you have bought a less attractive shoe, avoided a good movie, or even chosen on a less user-friendly web browser because you wanted to send a political message? If you have engaged in such a boycott, are you confident that there are more Americans who’ve done the same than there are “buycotters,” people who will actively patronize a controversial company in the face of the backlash? if anything, recent history shows that a proper buycott can sustain a corporation in the face of withering public attacks, because it’s simply more fun to treat yourself than to deny yourself. Just ask Chick-fil-A.

Besides which, with very limited (and often debatable) exceptions, it’s simply a fact that when there is sufficient demand for the products they sell, politically controversial corporations can endure considerable online backlash and continue to thrive. Just look at the corporate worth of the most progressive companies, including companies that have directly intervened in American culture wars: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Salesforce, Nike . . . they’re all worth far more today than they were five years ago.

There was a time when I thought there was at least one very important exception to the rule that products trump politics: the NFL. Last year a J.D. Power survey of 9,200 fans indicated that the Kaepernick-led national-anthem protests were the top reason why fans reported they watched fewer games the previous season. In response, I wrote a piece called “Politicize Sports, Pay the Price.” But then, as we received more information — about more sports — the picture grew considerably more cloudy.

It turns out that major sports that have shunned politics have also faced ratings and attendance declines. College football, perhaps red America’s most beloved sport, experienced ratings declines across multiple networks. Attendance at Major League Baseball games is at its lowest level in 15 years. Even Olympics ratings are falling.

Yes, there are individual exceptions. Put the Cubs in position to win their first World Series in a century, and more people will watch. A thrilling College Football playoff can draw more eyeballs — especially when no games are scheduled on New Year’s Eve. But the only major sports league that’s showing a real and broad increase in viewers just so happens to be the most political. The NBA is achieving unheard-of growth in a time of viewer fragmentation and cord-cutting. As I detailed in a piece earlier this year, viewership went up a whopping 20 percent on the major networks during the 2017-18 season, and 17 out of 30 teams saw growth in their local television packages.

Why? Yes, there some “buycotting” going on. The NBA has a heavy contingent of fans in blue America, some of whom no doubt thrill to Gregg Popovich’s rants and applaud LeBron James’s political stands. But, really, the product is just so much better than it used to be. Many of the league’s top stars are extremely likable, high-character family men. The game is fast-paced. It’s blessed with a number of transcendent athletes who are a joy to watch on the court.

You know the old saying, “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door”? In 2018, when you build a better mousetrap, you’ll get your chance to preach to the world. Corporate progressives know this very well. Conservatives need to learn it. If you’re going to use your corporate platform for political purposes, Jordans and iPhones can help you weather virtually any online storm.

We are weaponizing norms, using them as a battle shield when they can protect us and as a sword when they can hurt our enemies.

EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is Jonah Goldberg’s weekly “news”letter, the G-File. Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.

Dear Reader (Including all the depressed Sex and the City fans),

As Tonto said when the Lone Ranger wanted to shoot his favorite grizzly, bear with me.

You may not have noticed, but a lot of prominent people have conducted themselves poorly in our public discourse lately. One need only dip a spoon into the bubbling caldron of asininity, crudity, and viciousness to illustrate the point.

The president of the United States alone has a greatest-hits album that we are all familiar with at this point, so I need not move on that subject like a b****.

His former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, not long ago made a mocking “wah wah” sad-trombone sound while someone described a child with Down syndrome being distraught over being separated from her mother and put in a cage. His former campaign chairman, Steve Bannon, told a crowd full of nativists, xenophobes, and racists, “Let them call you racist. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honor.” On the same tour, the man who wanted his former website to be the “platform for the alt-right” and who made a defender of “ephebophilia” one of its early stars, praised the virility and fashion sense of Mussolini.

More recently, would-be Spartacus of the Senate Cory Booker said that anyone supporting the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh was “complicit in evil.” Last week, to cheers of many in the media, protesters relentlessly beclowned themselves in a Senate hearing, offering barbaric yawps to punctuate the more refined smearing and character-assassination perpetrated by elected officials. The same week, a senior official in the White House anonymously confessed to being part of a secret cabal working against an “amoral” president.

The other day, Hillary Clinton peddled a lie just to sow paranoia and rage. Supposedly serious commentators invoke polls of an uniformed electorate to argue that constitutional procedures should be ignored. Others argue for court packing, while less serious people ask, “Where’s John Wilkes Booth when you need him?” Others brandish a replica of the severed head of the president, apologize for it, and then apologize for the apology.

Once you start thinking about it, trying to come up with these kinds of examples becomes like trying to take a sip from fire hose.

Pastors have defended a child predator on the grounds that King David did something or other. Conspiracy theories now count as “Breaking News” on cable-news shows, and commentators float the idea that the people want a “dictator.” When the president behaved churlishly in response to the death of a war-hero senator, his defenders insist that the dead man started it.

Behold, My Decadence

I bring all of this up to explain why, when I read the opening sentence of R. R. Reno’s “review” of my book, you may have heard a guffaw from me so loud and sudden that it frightened pigeons from their perches and caused dogs to bark at an unseen threat: “Jonah Goldberg exemplifies the decadence and dysfunction of today’s public discourse.”

Now I will admit, I do have a tendency to wallow in my own crapulence. Indeed, I have a hangover right now, and I’m treating it with a cigar.

But that’s not what Reno has in mind.

The editor of First Things thinks my effort to defend the Miracle of Western civilization and the glorious principles of the Founding and to imbue people with a sense of gratitude for this nation is a sign of civilizational and moral rot.

Advertisement

I won’t go line by line through Reno’s typing, not least because I feel little need to respond to every distortion and dishonesty in a review written by someone who gives little sign that he actually read (or, at least, comprehended) the book. There have been a few of these sorts of reviews by people who are more interested in demonstrating their courage by slaughtering strawmen. But I will say that it’s an at-times truly shabby effort in which Reno takes words and phrases out of their context, rips away the explicit meaning I give to those words and phrases, and then slaps on different meaning in order to make a more convenient target. He’s a bit like a man who takes a bear out of its environment, sedates it, and then, after having it tied to a stake, shoots it from a great distance and declares himself a mighty hunter.

The only concession I will make is that I made it a bit too easy for some to indulge their instinct to be triggered. The book begins with the sentence, “There is no God in this book.” Alas, for some people, the first bite of an appetizer is enough for them to render an opinion on every course of the meal.

Advertisement

As I’ve explained many times now, including in the book itself, what I tried to do is offer an argument that can break through to people who do not believe in God or who cannot be appealed to through arguments derived from His divine authority.

Advertisement

In short, I tried to cut through the “decadence and dysfunction of today’s public discourse” and engage in good old-fashioned persuasion and argument. I admit that I’m not the twinned feminine reincarnation of Cicero that is Diamond and Silk, but I did my best.

But back to the rot. Contra Reno’s best efforts to insinuate otherwise, I write at considerable length about how many of our gravest problems stem from the shrinking of organized religion and the declining centrality of God in our lives. Indeed, I argue that most of our woes are caused by the fact that civil society — family, faith, community — is crumbling, and, as a result, we are looking to the government and politics for meaning in our lives.

And that appears to be what Reno — and many other conservatives are doing — too. Last year, Reno wrote:

Our political struggles over nations and nationalisms are best understood as referenda on the West’s meta-politics over the last three generations, which has been one of disenchantment. The rising populism we’re seeing throughout the West reflects a desire for a return of the strong gods to public life.

I agree with this. The only difference between us on this point is that I, the weakly observant Jew, lament it while Reno, the devout Catholic, welcomes the return of the old, strong gods. He welcomes the end of the “neoliberal” order in favor of something more “substantial,” specifically nationalism: “It is not good for man to be alone, and it is a sign of health that our societies wish to reclaim, however haltingly, the nation, which is an important form of solidarity.”

I find it amusing that Reno denounces me for saying that turning away from the Miracle of liberal democratic capitalism — toward socialism or nationalism — is “reactionary” when that is not only precisely what it is but also precisely what Reno is.

I won’t recount my arguments about nationalism here, save to repeat that I think a little nationalism is healthy, while too much is poisonous. It is worth pointing out, however, that the “strong god” of nationalism is a jealous god that demands fealty. Nationalist movements are every bit as capable as capitalism — and very often more so — of waging war on competing sources of authority. From Bismarck’s Kulturkampf to Hitler’s Gleichshaltung, German nationalists opposed particularity, pluralism, and, of course, liberty (a concept Reno puts remarkably little value upon).

Reno argues that we should look to Augustine’s concept of a “community of love,” which sounds fine by me. But nationalism’s record of fostering such communities is mixed at best, particularly when yoked to the power of a centralized state.

Which brings me to the most shocking and telling passage in Reno’s outburst.

Condemning every political challenge as a threat to “the liberal order” shirks responsibility. In Goldberg, the habit of denunciation reaches absurd heights. He rehearses the tiresome conservative trope that Democrats are not true liberals but illiberal progressives. According to Goldberg, Trump voters are ingrates, moral hypocrites, and tribalistic “reactionaries.” So are Clinton and Sanders voters. He believes that ever since Woodrow Wilson, what goes by the name “liberal” in America has in fact been an anti-liberal form of reactionary regression from the Miracle. Anyone who defines Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt as enemies of the liberal order is a political propagandist, not a thinker concerned with understanding our populist-driven challenges.

Leave aside the irony of an author who opens with a denunciation decrying the “habit of denunciation.” Also, ignore the fact I do not consider every political challenge a threat to the liberal order or characterize voters the way he claims. That Reno is tired of hearing that modern liberals are not in fact classical liberals doesn’t make it untrue, and why an ostensible conservative would be racing to claim otherwise is astonishing.

Consider Woodrow Wilson, a figure I will never tire of denouncing. Wilson denounced the Bill of Rights and the classically liberal structure of the Constitution. In office, he created the first modern propaganda ministry in Western civilization. He unleashed undercover propagandists to whip-up nationalist war-frenzy. He jailed thousands of political prisoners, many for simply committing thought crimes. He shut down newspapers. He oversaw a wave of anti-German sentiment that makes even the most hysterical visions of an anti-Muslim backlash seem restrained and sober. He considered “hyphenated Americans” to be enemies of the people: “Any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready.” He lent aid and comfort to violent, jingoistic vigilantism. He lamented that the South lost the Civil War, and he re-segregated the federal government. He admired Lincoln’s tyrannical means but detested the ends he sought. That sounds like an assault on the liberal order to me. It certainly doesn’t sound like a “community of love” either.

But since none of that seems to count for the editor of a Catholic organ, Wilson also had some choice words for the Catholic Church, calling it “an organization which, whenever and wherever it dares, prefers and enforces obedience to its own laws rather than to those of the state.”

FDR wasn’t the monster Wilson was — but the president-for-life who militarized the economy, tried to pack the courts, called for supplanting the Bill of Rights with a new “economic bill of rights,” who argued in the same speech that returning to the democratic “normalcy” of the prosperous 1920s would amount to a domestic surrender to “fascism,” and who in word and deed sought to transcend the order of liberty in the name of “bold, persistent, experimentation” was in no way shape or form a liberal under the old understanding of the word. Indeed, it was FDR more than anyone else who is responsible for the progressive hijacking of the word “liberal.” Progressives had so poisoned the label “progressive” with the American people that they needed to rebrand, leaving the word to be picked up and further soiled by Communists for the next few decades.

The New Statists, Same as the Old Statists

Reno is just one soldier in a larger rearguard assault from segments of the Right, who denounced phrases like “economic patriotism” when it passed Barack Obama’s lips but nod and cheer when similar phrases come out of the mouths of “nationalists.” They see the state as the key to fostering a new social solidarity because it alone speaks for their new idol — or “strong god” — of the Nation. Passionate nationalists, like passionate socialists, ultimately believe that the State can love you, and if the right people take it over, the divisions that are inevitable in a free society will be knitted together by some government initiative. But that is not love, it is lust. It is a lust for power and victory for your vision over all others.

And it’s not new. These same claims about capitalism or (classical) liberalism being a spent force or outdated or bankrupt have accompanied every attempt — failed and successful — to expand government or yoke it to the interests of some group that claims to have found a “third way.”

Their reactionary statolatry renders them deaf and blind to an idea obvious to the Founders and once obvious to conservatives committed to conserving the liberal order: You will not always have your hands on the reins, for you will not always be in the saddle.

Even now, you can hear the growing clamor for the government to take control of Facebook or Google because the libruls there don’t like us. I’m open to sensible regulation, and if more is needed, fine. But if the idea that bringing these businesses under the control of the state — make them utilities! — is merely economically and philosophically blinkered if Republicans are in office, it becomes an incandescent bonfire of insipidity when you realize that one day — perhaps one day soon — progressives will take charge. Thinking that the same people who favor silencing speech, spiking politically incorrect science, and using the government to punish institutions that are non-compliant with the progressive agenda (I’m looking at you wedding-cake bakers, birth-control-eschewing octogenarian nuns, and Catholic adoption agencies) would shirk from using these shiny toys for their own ends is absurd.

Moreover, as we learned — or should have learned — under Wilson and FDR, when the government “reins in” business, businesses often grab the reins of government. U.S. Steel, AT&T, and other corporate behemoths welcomed regulation precisely because they understood that the government was uniquely equipped to protect them from competition. Cartelized social media wouldn’t become friendlier to conservatives; social media would then have men with badges and guns to enforce their hostility to conservatives.

The liberal order depends on impersonal rules that do not change when the factions controlling the execution of those rules change. As I wrote earlier this week, this simple, glorious idea that as much as any other helped create the Miracle is melting away in partisan heat. We are weaponizing norms, using them as a battle shield when they can protect us and as a sword when they can hurt our enemies, but never honoring them when wielded by others. We want to simultaneously fight fire with fire and denounce our opponents for using fire. The only solution in a free society isn’t some final and eternal victory, but to use the torches not as weapons but illumination for the eternal threats to the Miracle: the unconstrained tribalism that denies others the right to be wrong.

I’ll close with my favorite scene from A Man for All Seasons:

Roper: So now you’d give the Devil benefit of law! More: Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? Roper: I’d cut down every law in England to do that! More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned ’round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country’s planted thick with laws from coast to coast — man’s laws, not God’s — and if you cut them down — and you’re just the man to do it — do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I’d give the Devil benefit of law for my own safety’s sake.

Various & Sundry

Canine Update: Last night at the American Enterprise Institute’s annual dinner, it was heartening, if a little weird, to have so many strangers come up to me and ask about Zoë and Pippa. I’d pass along all the kind words, but one of the great things about dogs is that they just don’t care. If I told Pippa that her fans on Twitter have a ball watching her adventures, all she would hear is “BALL!” Anyway, the beasts are good. I had the midday walk yesterday, and Pippa got to do her favorite thing in the world: “accidentally” drop a tennis ball in a muddy creek and then retrieve it. She’s also very fond of sticks lately. She likes to bring her favorite stick into the car with her, even if she has a little trouble sometimes. Both of them are fully adjusted from the cross-country adventure, even if that comes with the usual sense of entitlement and impatience or making due with more bourgeois pastimes. Zoe even got to harass her oldest friend, Sammi.

If you’re in St. Louis come see me Tuesday night. On Thursday, I’ll be in Oooooooklahoommmaa where the wind comes sweeping down the plains.

If you’re seeing this on Friday, I’ll be on Special Report tonight. If you’re seeing this Saturday, I was on Special Report last night.

I had a great conversation with Ben Sasse on the latest episode of The Remnant. Where else can you hear a sitting senator ask, “Do you think the cat thinks I have nipples on my back?”

On Tuesday, another essay adapted from the Apocrypha of my book will appear in Commentary as the lead article. Here’s the cover.

There was nothing to be gained for him or Robert Mueller in a second trial.

Paul Manafort’s guilty plea in the District of Columbia makes perfect sense. We’ve been speculating about its likelihood since Manafort was convicted three weeks ago on eight felony counts of bank and tax fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia. There was nothing to be gained for Manafort or Special Counsel Robert Mueller in a second trial.

Naturally, the media are spun up because the plea agreement, which will cap the 69-year-old Manafort’s prison time at ten years, requires Manafort’s cooperation. Anti-Trumpers have visions of the walls closing in on the president. I would counter with what I said after the Virginia convictions:

At this point, it does not appear that Mueller has a collusion case against Trump associates. His indictments involving Russian hacking and troll farms do not suggest complicity by the Trump campaign. I also find it hard to believe Mueller sees Manafort as the key to making a case on Trump when Mueller has had [Richard] Gates — Manafort’s partner — as a cooperator for six months. You have to figure Gates knows whatever Manafort knows about collusion. Yet, since Gates began cooperating with the special counsel, Mueller has filed the charges against Russians that do not implicate Trump, and has transferred those cases to other Justice Department components.

I elaborated that, when it comes to Manafort, Mueller’s focus is not President Trump. It is Russia, “specifically, Manafort’s longtime connections to Kremlin-connected operatives.” This seems consistent with what Manafort’s camp is telling the press. Politico quotes a source close to Trump’s former campaign chairman: “The cooperation agreement does not involve the Trump campaign. . . .There was no collusion with Russia.”

The guilty plea serves Mueller’s purposes. He already had Manafort looking at a potential 80 years of prison exposure from the first case. He did not need another trial and additional jail time to ratchet up pressure. So prosecutors dropped the money-laundering charges as well as allegations that Manafort made false statements and failed to register as a foreign agent of a Kremlin-connected Ukranian party; but Mueller still got Manafort to admit to the underlying conduct in those charges by having the defendant plead guilty to the special counsel’s favorite device, the amorphous, elastic charge of “conspiracy against the United States.” In addition, Manafort pled guilty to obstructing justice — the witness-tampering allegation based on which he has been detained without bail.

Advertisement

Advertisement

The defendant, moreover, admitted guilt to the bank-fraud charges on which the Virginia jury hung. If Manafort cooperates to Mueller’s satisfaction, these unresolved counts will be dismissed; but the admissions would make it difficult for Manafort to fight the charges if they were ever retried.

The resolution of Manafort’s cases in a manner that spares both parties a second trial and months of appeals closes an important chapter in the special counsel’s investigation. It potentially brings the end into sight. That prospect, of course, intensifies speculation about the president’s status. To borrow, again, from what I said three weeks ago, Mueller’s focus on Trump seems to involve possible obstruction of the investigation, not so-called collusion.

Advertisement

If we assume, for argument’s sake, that the special counsel has wanted to make a criminal case on the president (I’ve never been fully convinced of this), the challenge Mueller has had from the start is that there was no underlying crime to predicate his investigation. He was rashly appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the uproar over the president’s ham-fisted firing of FBI director James Comey. But terminating executive-branch officers is not obstruction; it is a prerogative of the presidency. If it is done abusively or for unsavory motives, that could be grounds for impeachment, but not for criminal prosecution.

Ditto harassing the attorney general, contemplating the removal of the special counsel himself, and allegedly weighing in on whether Michael Flynn, the former national-security adviser, should be investigated. We can all agree — or, at least, many of us do agree — that it would be better if the president did not do such things. It should be indisputable, though, that the Constitution endows him with the authority to do them. If you don’t like it, vote him out of office . . . but it is not the business of prosecutors.

Advertisement

As for “collusion,” it is not a crime unless it rises to the level of conspiracy to violate a federal criminal law. At least publicly, despite all the intelligence leaks, there has never been credible evidence that the president conspired with the Russian regime to commit cyberespionage or any other crime.

Because Mueller is a federal prosecutor, not counsel to a congressional committee, his job should be limited to deciding whether there are viable criminal charges. Let’s assume there are not. The question then becomes whether Mueller is at liberty to do more than say simply that in his final report — insufficient evidence, period. Specifically, does his mandate include outlining unsavory conduct that results in no criminal charges, and opining on the president’s judgment and fitness, as well as on whether the Justice Department and the FBI had legitimate reasons to investigate the Trump campaign? That is, is he permitted to file a comprehensive narrative of uncharged behavior that a Democrat-controlled Congress could try to inflate into impeachable offenses?

These questions are just coming to the fore. The completion of the Manafort prosecution brings us closer to the day they will be answered, one way or another.

(Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters)

Some of them could be consequential, but most surely are not.

Maybe this week . . . maybe next week. We’re led to believe President Trump is on the verge of revealing more of the currently redacted information from the Carter Page FISA-warrant papers.

This would be a welcome development. When it comes to the supposed factual basis on which the FBI and Justice Department sought a national-security eavesdropping warrant — alleging that Page was an agent of the Kremlin and that the Trump campaign was complicit in Russia’s hacking conspiracy — the more transparency the better.

Advertisement

Advertisement

Page has never been charged with any crime, much less with espionage. That is a salient fact because to get a FISA warrant on an American citizen, the FBI is required to show that the citizen’s activities on behalf of a foreign power violate federal criminal law. The FBI and Justice Department went to the FISA court four times over nine months, from October 2016 through June 2017, claiming to have grounds that Page was involved in heinous clandestine activity. Why isn’t he in handcuffs?

I believe it is because they never had a case. All they appear to have had were the 2013 attempt by Russian spies to recruit Page as an asset, and the Steele dossier. If I’m right about that, this would be problematic for the bureau, for two reasons.

First, Page seems to have cooperated in the FBI and DOJ’s prosecution of the Russian operatives, and — both back then and in the ensuing years — to have made himself available pretty much whenever the FBI wanted to interview him. Page has said lots of stupid things about the supposed virtues of appeasing Putin’s anti-American regime, but he is also an Annapolis grad and former U.S. naval intelligence officer. It is not a crime to be targeted for recruitment (by a spy who concluded Page was “an idiot”), to have invested in the Russian energy sector, or to have loopy political views.

Advertisement

Second, the Steele dossier is a compendium of foreign-supplied, rank-hearsay opposition research sponsored by the Clinton campaign. It was never corroborated by the FBI (even though there are guidelines forbidding the bureau from presenting unverified information to the FISA court), and several of its key allegations have been convincingly refuted. It is, furthermore, the subject of libel lawsuits, in defense against which the author — former British spy (and rabid anti-Trump partisan) Christopher Steele — has shrunk from claiming his allegations are true, describing them merely as “raw intelligence” that was “unverified” and needed to be investigated.

The Smoking Gun Must Be in the Redactions . . . Right?

Nevertheless, defenders of the FBI’s investigation push back, claiming there is more to the investigation of Page, maybe much more, than we know about. This doesn’t just fly in the face of the lack of any “collusion” prosecutions. Congressional investigators tell us that the Steele-dossier allegations were central to the FISA-warrant applications. The FBI’s former deputy director, Andrew McCabe, acknowledged that without the dossier the FBI could not have claimed probable cause for the surveillance.

So, what are the defenders relying on? The redactions. Far from complaining about the lack of transparency, they imagine that under those thousands of blacked-out lines lies the motherlode. The FISA documents amount to 412 pages, and those black-outs make up the lion’s share. Therefore, the defenders reason, the FBI had more than just a failed recruitment episode and the Steele dossier against Page — probably a whole lot more.

I doubt it.

I will have you know, dear readers, that I have spent long hours scrutinizing the FISA documents so you don’t have to. The vast majority of what is blacked out has nothing to do with the probable-cause showing against Carter Page. In fact, while the probable-cause showing is the most significant part of a FISA application package, it is a comparatively small part.

I use the term “package” because a government submission to the FISA court is not just an application signed by the investigative agent. It also includes a lengthy certification by a top-ranking national-security official (here, the FBI’s director or deputy director), a short approval declaration by the Justice Department (here, by the deputy attorney general), and the proposed warrant itself to be signed by the judge. In congressional testimony, former FBI director James Comey claimed that FISA submissions are often thicker than his wrists. Besides being a bit of an exaggeration, this description failed to explain that most of the extensive documentation is unrelated to probable cause, thus conveying the misimpression that FISA applications are always supported by mountainous evidence.

To compare, the first Page submission was just 83 pages — Jim Comey is a big guy; that wouldn’t make it too far up his wrist. Let’s analyze those 83 pages in order to consider how much the redacted information may bear on probable cause.

Extensive Redactions Unrelated to Page

Instantly, we find we drop from 83 down to 54 pages. Turns out the package’s last 29 pages are not part of the warrant application at all. They consist of the afore-described FBI certification, the DOJ approval, and a proposed warrant for the judge to sign — nothing to do with establishing probable cause that Page is a Russian asset conspiring against the election.

These 29 pages are very heavily redacted. You’re probably wondering why, because you’ve been led to believe that redactions must involve damning evidence against Page. Well, no.

See, FISA documents are not classified solely because of alleged clandestine doings by foreign operatives. They also set forth the secret authorities the government is granted in order to carry out the surveillance, the manner in which the surveillance is to be conducted, the communications facilities the FBI is permitted to monitor, the methods by which the bureau is permitted to gain access to those facilities, the minimization instructions that must be followed to avoid unauthorized monitoring, and so on.

This information must remain concealed. The FBI and the Justice Department wanted these redactions not because they bear on Carter Page’s activities, but because they relate to intelligence methods. Exposing this information would compromise virtually all of the government’s FISA investigations. Rest assured that, even if President Trump orders the disclosure of some additional details about Page, all this other information about the authorities, procedures, and techniques germane to national-security surveillance will remain blacked out.

FISA-Warrant Application Traces FISA Statute

So let’s finally turn to the 54-page application. Yes, a great deal of it is blacked out. But that hardly means we are clueless about what most of the redacted information conveys.

Here is the code that you need to crack. The application has numbered paragraphs (with a lot of subparagraphs within them). For the most part, these numbered paragraphs correspond to the sections of the FISA statute that governs FISA applications, Section 1804 of Title 50, U.S. Code. Conforming the paragraphs to the statutory requirements makes it easier for the court to see that all necessary information is included. The requirements are set forth in nine subsections of §1804 — numbered (a)(1) through (a)(9). If you compare the Page warrant application with the statute, you see that paragraph 1 conforms to (a)(1), paragraph 2 to (a)(2), and so on.

Well guess what? Of these nine statutory requirements, only one involves the all-important probable-cause showing: (a)(3). In it, Congress directs the FBI to provide the court with “a statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon” to justify the bureau’s beliefs that (a) the proposed target is an agent of a foreign power and (b) the facilities or places the bureau wants to monitor are being used for the target’s clandestine activities.

None of the other eight sections bear on probable cause. They direct the government to supply: the identity of the applying officer and the target, a statement of the “minimization procedures” the FBI will use to avoid unauthorized monitoring, a description of the nature of the information sought (i.e., foreign intelligence), certifications by high-ranking national-security officials that the government is seeking foreign intelligence, an explanation of how the eavesdropping will be carried out, a recitation of any prior applications related to the target, and a statement of the proposed duration of the surveillance.

That is a lot of non-probable-cause information, and it is heavily redacted. In the first Page application it takes up about 21 of the 54 pages.

That means only 33 of the submission’s 83 pages deal with probable cause, beginning on page 2 and continuing into page 36. Bear in mind, by the way, that these pages often contain fewer than 20 double-spaced lines, with many lines consisting of a sub-heading or just a word or two of text. Contrary to what’s been suggested, we are not talking War and Peace here.

The Probable-Cause Showing Seems Thin

Now, what about those 33 pages? Well, a goodly chunk of them at the beginning does not address Carter Page at all. It’s all about Russia: The FBI explains that the regime in Moscow is a foreign power, that it has been messing with our elections since the Cold War, and that it meddled in them in 2016 by cyberespionage (with the help of WikiLeaks). We are eight pages into the factual recitation before we get to Page.

Plainly, the Page section rests on the two grounds that we have been told about: the Russian attempt to recruit him as a source in 2013, and the Steele dossier. The latter makes up the bulk of the probable-cause showing, pages 15–27. This includes the allegation that the FBI patently hung its hat on: Steele’s claim that, while in Russia in July 2016, Page met with two Putin-regime heavyweights, Igor Sechin and Igor Diveykin, discussing a corrupt quid pro quo arrangement involving sanctions relief for Moscow, as well as the possible transmission to the Trump campaign of “kompromat” (compromising information) about Mrs. Clinton that the Kremlin was purportedly holding. (Page denies knowing, let alone meeting, these men; there is no publicly known corroboration of Steele’s claim.)

Advertisement

Even parts of what the application labels the Page section have nothing to do with Page. There is, for example, the long, infamous footnote on Steele, a winding circumlocution in which the FBI and Justice Department strain to avoid telling the court that his work is sponsored by Clinton’s campaign and that he is passionately anti-Trump. There is also a discursion, based on media reports, about how Trump may be soft on Putin, how he may meekly accept the annexation of Crimea, and how the Trump campaign’s supposed intervention in Republican-platform-writing at the GOP convention weakened a plank on arming Ukraine (a claim that has been debunked by the Washington Examiner’s Byron York). Note that, even though the FBI had nine months to do its own independent investigation about these matters, the bureau and Justice Department instead regurgitated the same media reports in every FISA renewal application — and the FISA court apparently never questioned this peculiar “proof.”

The warrant application also contains a lengthy (five-page) section — repeated in all the renewal applications — that is largely based on Michael Isikoff’s September 23, 2016, Yahoo News article about Page’s purported meetings with Sechin and Diveykin. The upshot is that Page vehemently denied that these meetings took place, and the Trump campaign distanced itself from Page. It is difficult to understand how this section advances the case that Page is an agent of Russia; perhaps the government’s theory is that Page and the campaign were making false exculpatory statements that show consciousness of guilt. From what we can read, it is certainly not obvious that they were lying . . . but, if we’re going to talk about false statements, we must note that the FBI told the court that Steele was not the source for Isikoff’s news article, which turns out not to be true.

This section involving Page’s insistence that he is not a Russian agent is followed by six pages that are completely redacted. Is there smoking-gun probable-cause information hidden under these blackouts? I’d be surprised if there were, but we simply don’t know. If it can be done without compromising vital intelligence sources, it would be useful if the president ordered these pages to be disclosed.

Why Are Page’s Purported Crimes Redacted?

After that, though, this probable-cause section does not even purport to add to the probable-cause showing.

The final seven of the factual recitation’s 33 pages consist of a “conclusion” that begins by merely asserting what the FBI argues the foregoing pages have established. It then moves on to what, apparently, is a description of the criminal statutes Page has allegedly violated. We have to say “apparently” because these pages are all blacked out.

Why redact Page’s alleged crimes? Is it because Page is still under the investigation and the FBI doesn’t want to tip him off about its suspicions? Is it because the “crime” allegations come from the Steele dossier and the FBI would rather not acknowledge that? Is it because the FBI, confident that no one would ever get to see this FISA-warrant application, made extravagant claims? Again, we don’t know. But what would be the harm to national security in disclosing to the public what crimes the FBI and Justice Department alleged that Page had committed? We already know they accused him of being a Russian agent complicit in an espionage conspiracy against the election. How much worse can it be?

Anyway, that’s it as far as probable cause goes in the first application. As one would expect, the three warrant-renewal applications grow progressively (but not significantly) longer than the initial 83-page package (98, 110, and 121 pages, respectively). They incorporate and attempt to build on the first surveillance. There are more redactions in the probable-cause section, at least some of which appear to relate to Page’s then-ongoing activities. Again, since Page has never been charged with a “collusion” offense (no one has), and since he has been very public in both denying sinister dealings with Russia and demanding an accounting from the FBI, it would be surprising if the redactions were earth-shattering.

The point, though, is that while some of the redactions could be consequential, most surely are not. Their importance has been inflated. The combined 412 pages of FISA packages are duplicative, with what largely appear to be the same redactions threading through all four application packages. For the most part, if we compare the redactions to the requirements of the FISA statute, we can figure out the types of information the government has concealed and why it has done so.

The vast majority of what’s been redacted has nothing to do with establishing probable cause that Carter Page was a Russian asset whose clandestine activities involved criminal violations. The suggestion that, hidden in the redactions, there is a trove of evidence, derived from neither the Steele dossier nor the Russian attempt to recruit Page about five years ago, seems highly unlikely.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

ISTANBUL — It was 4 a.m. in December when Tunca Öğreten heard loud kicks against the door of his apartment.

Twenty anti-terrorist police officers armed with rifles knocked it down and ransacked the home Öğreten shared with his fiancee, before arresting him.

He was kept in a police cell, barely 10 feet square, with four other men for 24 days. With no toilet or shower, he was forced to wash himself by saving up water bottles and to urinate into an empty bottle.

“I begged them, ‘Take me to prison,’” Öğreten said. “Prison would be better than this torture.”

A judge eventually ordered him to jail, where he languished for 10 more months.

Öğreten, a 37-year-old journalist, is accused of crimes against the state for reporting on hacked emails that accused a company run by Turkey’s energy minister of being involved in trading oil from the Islamic State. Almost two years after the raid, he still awaits trial.

Öğreten is far from alone.

Turkey, a key NATO ally, has detained tens of thousands of teachers, lawyers, students, judges and other officials amid a crackdown on dissent by the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the failed coup of 2016.

The country’s 384 prisons and detention facilities are already overcrowded, holding 224,974 inmates as of March 20, according to the Ministry of Justice — almost 7 percent over their official capacity.

Turkey now has the third-highest per capita prison population in Europe, behind only Russia and the tiny post-Soviet dictatorship of Belarus. (The U.S. has the highest rate in the world.)

To fix the problem, the ministry announced in December that it will build 228 more prisons over the next five years.

“Prison wings designed for 20 people are being used to keep up to 45,” opposition CHP party spokesman and former lawmaker Baris Yarkadaş told NBC News. “Some of them must sleep on the floor, others develop respiratory sickness. The solution of Erdogan’s government is just to keep building more prisons.”

Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A NATO ally 'isn't acting like one'

Images of civilians climbing on tanks and soldiers being violently beaten with belts dominated news coverage of the aborted coup on July 15, 2016, in which 251 people died.

But Erdogan’s triumphant revenge on dissenters has proved no less brutal.

He immediately blamed the coup on influential cleric Fethullah Gulen, 77, a former Erdogan ally who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania; Gulen denies involvement and the White House has resisted demands for his extradition.

Turkey describes Gulen followers as members of the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) and accuses them of a long-running campaign to overthrow the state through the infiltration of state institutions, particularly the military, police and judiciary.

At least 169,000 state workers, soldiers or others have been suspended or dismissed from government jobs in the crackdown, according to the Ministry of Justice. Activist websites such as TurkeyPurge.com, which is blocked inside the country, put the numbers even higher. More than two years after the coup, the roundups continue; 12 accused coup members were detained this month according to the official Anadolu news agency.

“These days you only have to have a bank account or study at a university with Gulen connections and the courts consider that you are a terrorist,” Adnan Seker, a lawyer who has been arrested for alleged FETO links, said. He denies any involvement in the coup. “I do not even find sympathy for those who adopt violence.”

Erdogan has also used a two-year state of emergency, which ended only last month, to detain anyone suspected of being linked to outlawed groups such as the Kurdish separatist PKK, which is recognized by the U.S. and Turkey as a terrorist organization.

Among those is Andrew Brunson, a North Carolina evangelical pastor who was arrested in 2016 on charges of espionage and “committing crimes on behalf of terror groups without being a member.” He has been released from prison but remains under house arrest and is expected to face trial next month.

Brunson, 50, has lived in Turkey for 23 years, running the small Resurrection Church in the western city of Izmir. The Erdogan-linked Daily Sabah newspaper reported last month that a prominent member of Brunson’s congregation had shared PKK links on social media.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has appealed to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in person for the pastor’s release from house arrest, calling him “an innocent man.”","fetullah terrorist organization feto

“Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness” is one of the best-known phrases in the United States Declaration of Independence. We have Thomas Jefferson to thank for the phrase, which has gone on to play significant roles in court cases including 1967’s Loving v. Virginia in which the Supreme Court invalidated a Virginia law that prohibited the interracial marriage, noting the ""freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.""

We may all be free to pursue happiness, but where we live in the U.S plays a deeper role in this quest than we may think, or so new research from WalletHub suggests. The personal finance site and app ranked 2018’s Happiest States in America, finding that some states are doing significantly better in this pursuit than others.

""We analyzed the 50 states across 31 metrics, which were chosen in conjunction with several academic experts,” says Jill Gonzalez, WalletHub analyst. “The metrics were selected based on their relevance as well as availability of data. The most important metrics were the share of adult depression, suicide rates, number of work hours, job security and idealness of weather.""

Hawaii and Utah take top slots; Arkansas and West Virginia dwell at the bottom

The five happiest states based on these metrics are Hawaii, Utah, Minnesota, and North Dakota, with California coming in at No. 5. The bottom-ranking states are Oklahoma, Alaska, Louisiana, and Arkansas, with West Virginia slumping in at No. 50.

""There are some differences from last year's results, like Hawaii moving up from third to first place this year, or North Dakota up from fourteenth to fourth this year,” says Gonzalez. “However, we do not encourage comparisons between reports from different years, as we have updated our methodology since then.""

Hawaii is pricey but laid-back and outdoorsy

Perhaps the most standout quality of this list is what lies in WalletHub’s intro, which notes that “money doesn’t drive happiness” and cites that “happiness only increases with wealth up to an annual income of $75,000”, based on 2010 research.

This is a cheerful but difficult sentiment to buy, particularly when you consider that Hawaii has the highest cost of living in the U.S. You’re probably not relocating to Hawaii unless you’re doing very well financially, and if you’re living there without the means, you could be among the nearly 11 percent of the population struggling with poverty.

But Hawaii has something that is invaluable: a relatively relaxed attitude with a predilection for social interaction and outdoorsy adventures.

“Hawaii’s happiness [ranking] is really attributed to culture,” Pamela Gail Johnson, founder of The Secret Society of Happy People tells NBC News Better. “There's a city environment, but culturally, it's more laid-back, which contributes to emotional and physical well-being. There’s lots of beaches, walking and hiking. It’s an environment that fosters a ‘stop and smell the roses’ mentality.”

Still, it’s interesting that of all 50 states, Hawaii had the lowest-adequate sleep rate. Perhaps there’s an argument for pulling an all-nighter in the name of happiness?

Utah touts low divorce rates, work-life balance and community efforts

Utah, the second-happiest state based on this ranking, is of course, very different in both in geography and culture than Hawaii. But it ranks highly on a variety of levels; it’s first in fewest work hours, volunteer rate and has the lowest divorce rate. It also came in second (after Colorado, which ranked at 18th overall) in highest sports participation rate.

“We know that if you ever look for a happy pick-me-up, helping others, is a boost,” says Johnson. “Utah’s volunteer rate certainly contributes to its [second-place ranking]. Having the lowest divorce rate also says something because our significant relationships, whether marriage or friendship, play a huge role in our happiness.”

A connection to nature is profoundly powerful

Having beautiful and accessible natural scenery within reach is also a perk for Utah, California and other high-ranking states.

“Some explanation around places such as California, Hawaii, Utah and North Dakota’s [high ranking] suggest that connection to nature can help support happiness, and that time spent outdoors can truly teach about containment, lower expectations from the artificial, technology-driven world around us and help foster that connectedness to the earth and other people,” says Christie Tcharkhoutian a marriage and family therapist .

“An additional component of the happiness that may contribute to residents of California is the aspect of hope and purpose,” she adds. “Many people live in California to pursue their dreams and that sense of purpose that you are working towards something meaningful, even if you haven’t yet reached your end goal, can provide more access to happiness as a state of mind as that pursuit continues.”

West Virginia and Arkansas’s economy woes are red flags

Though Wallethub champions the idea that you can’t buy happiness, bottom-ranking states West Virginia and Arkansas underscore the importance of a vital economy and the unhappiness the lack of it can bring. West Virginia was the worst state for business according to a 2017 poll while Arkansas came in at 41. Both states improved just slightly in the same poll in 2018 coming in at 48 and 40, respectively. These states were also bottom dwellers on WalletHub’s 2018 Best & Worst State Economies list.

“I think both in West Virginia and Arkansas you have to look at the economy,” says Johnson. “They rank low on the work front and on the emotional and physical well being front and I think a piece of that is interconnected to jobs. I doubt the average wage there [amounts] to $75k a year. This could contribute to the high rate of adult depression (Arkansas came in at 48 and West Virginia at 49).”

Remember: you can be happy anywhere

I live in Los Angeles, the city in the fifth-happiest state according to this report, but it’s stressful to make ends meet here and I can’t help but wonder, would I be happier in Hawaii where the vibe is more relaxed? Or maybe Utah where the cost of living is lower and the work hours aren’t insane?

But I know I’m not about to pick up and go, so I have to remember that happiness is a place that exists wherever I make it.

“It is important to understand happiness as a state of being, that can be experienced, rather than a status quo or end goal to ‘be achieved,’” says Tcharkhoutian.

Happiness comes down to being physically and emotionally healthy, pursuing things that are meaningful to us personally and contributing to something larger than ourselves.

Frank Niles, PhD, a social scientist, adventure athlete and executive educator finds that happiness does seem to have a formula — and zip codes aren’t a part of it.

“Happiness comes down to being physically and emotionally healthy, pursuing things that are meaningful to us personally and contributing to something larger than ourselves,” says Niles, adding that time with other people is critical to this pursuit. “If you think about it, the most meaningful experiences we’ve had in our lives have been with other people. So, if you were to ask me, ‘What can I do to become more happy?’ I would say live fully in the present, seek ways to make a difference in the lives of other people everyday, and make time in your life to build healthy relationships that are defined by giving and receiving support.”

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

When 18-year-old Luke Fergie dropped out of high school, he had no idea what sort of career he’d pursue. All he knew was that he really loved playing “Rules of Survival,” then a relatively new online, multiplayer battle game from NetEase Games.

Forward to now, six months later: The Irish teen, who goes by the username iFerg, has more than 150,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel, and has turned a hobby into a job, making sponsored videos for developers looking to promote their content to his followers.

“Sponsored videos seem to be the most financially beneficial for me,” Fergie told NBC News. “A YouTuber of my size with the average views I get receives something in the region of $300-$500 per integrated [video] and somewhere around $1,000-$1,500 for a dedicated video.”

Fergie notes that he’s not only comfortable financially, he’s spending less time working than he would at a regular 9-5 job.

“I usually stream for two hours a day and then spend like 30 minutes to an hour recording/editing a video,” he said. “[For practice] I just play when I want to with friends to maintain gunskill and not become rusty. I know players that play 10 hours plus a day, but if you have a spare three hours a day that should be a good enough investment of time to grow.”

Fergie’s path isn’t the only one for gamers looking to monetize their passion, especially not if they are playing eSports, a burgeoning category that sees publishers forming official leagues (as well as attracting independent teams), hosting tournaments, live-streaming events, and partnering with major brands.

Research firm NewZoo predicts the eSports industry will be worth $905 million this year. SuperData, a marketing intelligence firm focused predominantly on gaming, suggests that this number is too conservative, with a report appraising eSports at $1.5 billion in 2017.

Some put that figure even higher.

“We’ve seen industry projections that estimate eSports revenue will grow to as much as $40 billion by 2025,” said Andrew Paradise, CEO and founder of Skillz, a mobile gaming platform.

The discrepancy in valuations, according to Chris Hopper, head of North American Esports at Riot Games, maker of the monumental hit League of Legends (LoL), is partly due to the fact that eSports is “tough to contextualize” within the broader gaming scope. It all comes down to the question: When does a game qualify as a sport?

“At some point these big [financial] numbers become kind of meaningless for us,” said Hopper. “We know what we have to spend and what we are committed to doing with eSports, so for us it’s more about securing our revenue to keep our leagues sustainable.”

A privately held company, Riot doesn’t share its earnings and Hopper declined to disclose how much money will go into its sports leagues and events this year, but it’s safe to say the investment will be considerable.

“The [annual League of Legends Championship Series], (LCS) is really big and really expensive,” said Hopper. “We now have 14 pro leagues globally and [roughly] 1000 players on some form of salary.”

It’s money well spent, evidently. “Last year the championships had over 80 million live unique viewers in a single day, across a number of platforms including Twitch and YouTube,” Hopper noted.

What a game needs to go pro: popularity and a competitive hook

While eSports borrows from traditional sports in terms of forming teams and championships, it doesn’t play by the same rules as major organizations like the NFL. Part of this is because the category is still extremely young, as Jihan Sheriff-Crichlow, CEO of Play All Gaming, a consultancy and marketing firm with a focus on building live gaming-related experiences, noted.

""There are still no rules and regulations that apply across the board,” he told NBC News.

But there are definite qualities eSports games need to succeed.

“Games have to be broadly popular among folks who play games and they need to have a distinct player vs. player competitive style,” said Mike Vorhaus, president of Magid Advisors. “The publisher/developer needs to encourage teams and early level competitions. Many publishers and developers then support later competitions at the regional, national, and international level.”

Gamers are no longer a tough audience to reach

E-sports advertisers and sponsors aren’t necessarily looking to cash in on so-called mainstream audiences. They’re appealing to “a demographic of people that are generally more elusive; people who are not spending much time or money on music or movies and can be hard for brands to reach,” said Paul Brewer, SVP Brand Partnerships, ESL.

Gaming platforms provide access to this growing cohort of consumers, and brands are seizing the opportunity to engage. “We’ve seen a 30-50 percent growth in sponsorship growth alone [in 2018 over 2017], and brands like AT&T and Sour Patch Kids seize eSports as a powerful marketing platform to get out their messages,” said Brewer.

Doron Nir, CEO and co-founder of StreamElements, a production platform for live-streamers, says that in this nascent space, “advertising is dirt cheap, and you get a huge bang for your buck.”

But professionalized eSports isn’t a category lacking in risks.

“As with any emerging market, this is a risky investment space. It is the Wild West, in many respects,” said Glenn Platt, a professor of marketing and interactive media and director of the Armstrong Institute for Interactive Media Studies at Miami University in Ohio. “There is no consistent market leader, no coordination, no clear regulatory structure, no aggregating organizations like networks, leagues, etc. We can’t even settle on what is “doping,” let alone who can play pro and who cannot. Prize pools are variable and endorsements are risky. Games emerge quickly (like Fortnite) and can disappear just as fast. Investing in any market at this early stage is high risk, high reward, to be certain.

However, these early-stage kinks don’t seem to be much more than that. “The industry has a momentum and fundamentals that no investor can deny,” said Platt. “For the investor, the devil is in the details. The question is not whether eSports is worth investing in — it is. The question is what part of the eSports ecosystem do you want to bet on?”

Aspiring pros are incentivized by salaries, benefits

So where does the player come in and how do they make cash from competing? It truly depends on the team and its contract, but while players like Fortnite legend Tyler “Ninja” Blevins top $500,000 a month, most contracted eSports players won’t make anywhere near that.

“The Overwatch league [by Activision Blizzard], has a mandatory minimum salary of $50,000 a year with health insurance, and teams often also pay for lodging and general expenses,” Nicole Carpenter, a reporter at Dot Esports who specializes in Overwatch, told NBC News. “They’ve been really good about that — and salaries could be going higher.”

League of Legends’ official pro players make a yearly minimum salary of $75,000.

A steady salary with benefits is undoubtedly a big incentive for aspiring pros, and they can feed their ambitions simply by learning and practicing the game from their own home.

“[LoL] is a great eSport because it's an easy video game to play in an aspirational way,” said Hopper. “I watch the NFL and I enjoy it but I can't go throw a 50-yard pass. But with LoL, you can feasibly do these things pros are doing. That’s why it’s successful as an eSports game — and making updates to the game every two weeks keeps it fresh for players.”

How the Madden 19 shooting may affect live events

As Vorhaus noted, live competitions are an integral component to the growth of eSports, and the shooting last month at the Madden 19 Tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, could thwart the interest of prospective investors in the budding space.

“I just met with a major client today who deals with accounts for an [international hotel chain],” said Sheriff-Crichlow. “Their major concern was the shooting. Everyone is asking me about it, worried it could happen again.”

To eliminate concerns, Sheriff-Crichlow suggests that venues could implement security measures like metal detectors.

Still, focusing on the mass shooting rather than the blossoming opportunities of eSports doesn’t make much sense to Sheriff-Crichlow. “Mass shootings happen in concerts, movie theaters, schools — anywhere. The problem isn’t the [space it occurs in], and ultimately I think making gaming more social is a good and healthy thing. You have a lot of introverted, shy people in gaming who really benefit from the interaction and excitement.”

Fergie, in his home of Belfast, Ireland when the gun violence broke out in Florida, was rattled by the news. “That was just crazy,” he said. As for the future, he thinks venues outside of the states won’t experience similar horrors, but added, “I’m not so sure about America.”","rio de janeiro brazil

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Thousands of people were allowed to return to their homes in Massachusetts on Sunday after a gas leak that set off dozens of house fires, killing one and injuring 25.

On Sunday morning, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency and public safety officials gave residents of Andover, North Andover and Lawrence the all-clear to return to their houses.

Nearly 8,600 affected gas meters had been turned off and approximately 15,000 power outages have been restored, according to officials.

""Its been a difficult and grueling weekend for the residents of Andover, North Andover and Lawrence. I often say the people of Massachusetts are resilient and this devastating situation is no exception,"" said Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker at a press conference on Sunday morning.

Baker said as of 6:30 a.m. ET, all homes in the affected area had been cleared of gas, although the city of Lawrence urged residents not to return to their houses until 7 a.m. ET.

Public safety officials said the next steps in the recovery process would include assessing the damage to the low pressure gas system and technicians inspecting all gas equipment.

“I want to commend the teams of police officers, firefighters and utility workers who worked diligently to meet this morning’s goal of reopening all homes in town to residents,” Andover Town Manager Andrew P. Flanagan said in a statement on Sunday.

Three separate explosions around 4:15 p.m. ET on Thursday and caused as many as 80 homes to be burned or damaged, according to officials.

""The explosions that occurred Thursday night have brought heartbreak for numerous families and the loss of one young life,"" Baker said on Sunday.

Leonel Robson, 18, of Lawrence, Mass., was killed when a chimney from a house explosion in Lawrence fell on the car he was in, officials said.

The explosions and fires initially mystified officials. Baker said at the time the state would work with the federal government to investigate what happened and who should be held accountable.

On Saturday, federal investigators said there didn't appear to been anything intentional behind the blasts.

The National Transportation Safety Board said on Saturday that it planned on looking into how Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, whose pipelines set off Thursday's explosions in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, kept records and how its procedures operated, according to the agency's chairman Robert Sumwalt.

They also plan to take a closer look into recent complaints from the utility's customers, Sumwalt said.

As residents returned to their homes, Columbia Gas urged people not to turn their gas back on.

""Now that most residents are back in their homes, our crews will work to restore gas service. This could take weeks. DO NOT turn your gas back on,"" the company tweeted.

Schools in Andover and North Andover were scheduled to reopen on Monday. However, in Lawrence, officials were still working to determine if reopening on Monday was possible.

At least a dozen families in Lawrence have been permanently displaced by the gas leak, according to a press release.

Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera said a relief fund for those affected by the gas leak had raised $100,000 as of Sunday morning.

As residents returned home, a three alarm fire occurred in Lawrence, but it was later determined that the fire was not in the affected area and was unrelated to the gas explosion.","national transportation safety board

WILMINGTON, N.C. — Rising floodwaters are now the major safety concern here after Florence, formerly a hurricane and now a tropical depression, knocked out power and left debris strewn across homes and streets. Driving through the city is like negotiating a maze, with portions of highways flooded, making the city essentially inaccessible by road from the rest of the state.

Rescues continued Sunday after crews plucked hundreds of people from their inundated homes in New Hanover County through the overnight hours, authorities said.

Most of Wilmington remains without power through the weekend while thousands of residents are stuck at home, hemmed in by downed trees and power lines. Countless homes are damaged but many homeowners who evacuated Wilmington are now unable to get back to see how bad the situation might be.

The local water utility has warned it may have to shut down, potentially leaving homes without drinkable water. Nearly all the businesses in this city of more than 117,000 are empty and closed.

Florence was downgraded to a tropical depression but continued to drench the Carolinas on Sunday, raising the threat for dangerous flash flooding and landslides. The storm has been blamed for at least a dozen deaths.

“Flash flooding and major river flooding will continue over a significant portion of the Carolinas,” the National Hurricane Center said late Sunday morning.

Here's the latest on Hurricane Florence:

Parts of southeastern North Carolina and northeast South Carolina were expected to get an additional 3 to 6 inches of rain, with total accumulations of 30 to 40 inches likely, according to the hurricane center.

Meanwhile, central and western North Carolina, far northern South Carolina and southwest Virginia were expected to get an additional 5 to 10 inches of rain, with total accumulations of 15 to 20 inches likely, elevating the risk of landslides, the center said.

As of 9 a.m. Sunday morning, Florence had dropped nearly 24 inches of rain in Wilmington so far, creating a new record of yearly rainfall with more than three months left in the year, according to the National Weather Service’s Eastern Region.

The storm continued to hit much of North Carolina and northern South Carolina with ""widespread heavy rains"" on Sunday, according to the hurricane center.

""These rainfall amounts will produce catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding,"" the center said.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said floodwaters were still raging across part of the state and ""the risk to life is rising with the angry waters.""

""The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,"" he said, adding that more than 900 people had been rescued from the waters by emergency responders so far.

Statewide, more than 703,184 people were without power statewide as of around 11 a.m. Sunday, according to the North Carolina's emergency management agency.

And the Cape Fear Power Utility Authority said it was in ""critical need"" of fuel to keep its water treatment plants running. If the utility does not get the fuel it needs within 48 hours, its customers would be without water and it would not be able to provide water services for public health and safety, according to a statement.

The power authority said it is unable to get fuel because roads into the city are cut off by extreme flooding.

""Now is a good time to begin filling up bathtubs and water jugs as a contingency to a loss of water delivery,"" the utility said.

Christopher Ray, a resident of Jacksonville, North Carolina, said he and his wife woke up at 3 a.m. Saturday morning because their chihuahua was barking and found the dog ""floating in her cage."" He had to evacuate their home using a dinghy because of the rising floodwaters. His home flooded, destroying some of his property including a smart car, several TVs, laptops and a work trailer, he said.

""It's going to be a big hit on us, a very big hit,"" he said after returning to his home and surveying the damage.

New Bern, North Carolina, Mayor Dana Outlaw told ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that officials remained ""very concerned"" about additional flooding and trees still toppling.

""A lot of the creeks around New Bern are increasing by the hour,"" he said.

Most of the deaths occurred in North Carolina, officials said. A woman and her infant were killed when a tree fell on their home in Wilmington; a woman died in Pender County after suffering a medical condition and large trees blocked roads to her home; two people died in Lenoir County; and three were killed in Duplin County in separate incidents when the cars they were in were washed away in high water, authorities said.

In South Carolina, a 61-year-old woman died after her car struck a downed tree on a highway in Union County Friday night, according to South Carolina Highway Patrol Capt. Kelley Hughes.

Two people in Horry County, South Carolina, died of carbon monoxide poisoning, the South Carolina Department of Public Safety tweeted Saturday night, and the department said that the deaths are being blamed on the storm.

One man drowned after a truck he was a passenger in overturned into a ditch that was over flowing with water in the early hours of Sunday morning, according to the Georgetown County Coroner. The driver and another passenger escaped.

As a white person, I was raised to be racially illiterate. On the rare occasion in which race came up in school or professional development, we typically studied “them,” not “us.” I learned about their histories, struggles and triumphs. But consistently left off the table was the question: “Histories, struggles and triumphs in relation to whom?”

Take the Jackie Robinson story. Robinson is celebrated as the first African-American to break the so-called color line and play in Major League Baseball. While Robinson was certainly an exceptional baseball player, framing the story this way depicts him as racially special. The subtext is that Robinson was the first black athlete strong enough to overcome the barriers preventing blacks from competing with whites; no black athletes before him were skilled enough to do so. While this tagline elevates Robinson as an individual, it implicitly positions African-Americans overall as inferior. It also falsely propagates the belief that racism in sports ended with Robinson, implying that current struggles against racism in sports are unnecessary.

Narratives of racial exceptionality obscure the reality of ongoing institutional white control while reinforcing individualism and the illusion of meritocracy.

Such narratives of racial exceptionality obscure the reality of ongoing institutional white control while reinforcing individualism and the illusion of meritocracy. Importantly, these narratives do whites a disservice by promoting racial illiteracy, leaving us with simplistic explanations for racial inequality. By not naming what those barriers were, who put them there, and how they were removed, we are also denied much needed anti-racist role models. In Robinson’s case, these role models are the white people who actually changed the rules and opened professional sports leagues to African-American players.

Historical narratives of racial exceptionality also leave us unprepared to address current conditions. For example, they hide the role of race in the response to the opioid crisis versus the crack epidemic, the Parkland shooting versus the Black Lives Matter movement, gentrification versus Flint, Michigan, the Bundy Standoff versus Standing Rock. We are left without the analysis needed to engage with these deeply complex social dynamics.

Imagine instead, if the story of Jackie Robinson went something like this: “Jackie Robinson was the first black man whites allowed to play major-league baseball.” This telling acknowledges the role of white control. It simply wasn’t up to Robinson. Had he walked onto the field before being granted permission by white owners and policy makers, the police would have removed him. Critically, the real Jackie Robinson story is a story of the relationship between blacks and whites in this country, between this individual black man and a white institution. Reframing race in the Jackie Robinson story reveals white structures of power and the strategies used by those who contested that power, strategies that we can build upon today as we work for racial justice.

As a product of my culture, my racial illiteracy has rested on a simplistic definition of a racist: an individual who consciously does not like people based on race and is intentionally hurtful to them. Based on this definition, racists are purposely mean. It follows that nice people with good intentions who are friendly to people of a different race cannot be racist. Not only does this definition hide the structural nature of racism, it also enables self-delusion: If I am a nice person with good intentions I am free of all racial bias and cannot participate in racism. Within this limited paradigm, to simply suggest that as a white person, my race has meaning and grants unearned advantage, much less to suggest that I have absorbed racist messages which may cause me to behave in racist ways — consciously or not — will be deeply disconcerting. The mainstream definition of a racist set me up beautifully to not only deny any impact of racial socialization, but also to receive any suggestion of racially problematic behavior as a personal blow — a questioning of my very moral character. Of course I would take umbrage, feel hurt, attacked and misunderstood; this is what I term white fragility.

Yet regardless of my intentions, these defensive reactions only protect the racist status quo. Those of us who profess to believe in racial equality have to challenge our understanding of racism in ways that don’t uphold it. We also need to build our skills and stamina for the racial discomfort engendered by a new paradigm.

The mainstream definition of a racist set me up beautifully to not only deny any impact of racial socialization, but also to receive any suggestion of racially problematic behavior as a personal blow... this is what I term white fragility.

While I was raised to see myself as somehow “innocent” of race, a lifetime of socialization as a white person does provide me insight into the ways my race shapes my frameworks, assumptions and responses, which in turn shape my identity, community and politics. I can speak as an “insider” to my socialization into whiteness: the messages of superiority I have received, patterns I have developed, advantages I enjoy and the personal and institutional challenges I face when seeking to counter racism. I am not, in fact, innocent of race.

Further, people of color have been providing us with the feedback we need for centuries, but our biases have prevented us from granting legitimacy to their voices. Those same biases make us more receptive to the information when we hear it from other white people. This makes it all the more critical that white people use our positions to break with white solidarity and hold one another accountable.

There are of course, inherent dilemmas when white people step up to address racism. Mainstream society has not prepared most of us to engage across race in an informed and thoughtful way. Given this, even those of us who have worked long and hard to develop racial literacy are all too often clumsy and hurtful. We tend to center ourselves instead of stepping back, listening more, and proceeding with humility. Still, we don’t gain literacy by studying alone, we gain fluency through practice.

All of us have a part to play, but the ultimate responsibility for addressing racism lies with those who control the institutions — white people. Jackie Robinson could not have broken the color barrier on his own. If I don’t understand racism as a deeply embedded system that I have been shaped by and participate in, my inaction will uphold it. In other words, as long as whiteness remains unnamed it will continue to reproduce racial inequality. To de-center whiteness it must be centered differently — in ways that expose its strategies so that we can challenge them. Because the question of whether I have been shaped by and participate in the forces of racism is not a question of if, but of how.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

For decades, a daily dose of aspirin has been widely considered a way to protect healthy people from cardiovascular disease and even cancer. But a large, new, international study finds that, even at low doses, long-term use of aspirin may be harmful — without providing benefit — for older people who have not already had a heart attack or stroke.

The new research reinforces the results from a study published in late August, which found that daily low-dose aspirin was too risky to be prescribed to patients at moderate risk of heart disease. In the August study and the new one, researchers found a significant risk of internal gastric bleeding caused by the medication, which thins the blood. Older patients experienced no health benefits from taking aspirin, according to the new report, published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine,

“We knew there would an increased risk of bleeding with aspirin, because there has always been,"" said study coauthor Dr. Anne Murray, a geriatrician and epidemiologist at the Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. ""But not only did it not decrease risk of disability or death, it did not decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke, and there was an increase in the rate of death.""

""For healthy people, 70 and older, who don’t have a reason to be on aspirin, such as a previous heart attack or stroke, there was no discernible benefit.""

The current guidelines recommend a daily aspirin for adults in their 50s who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or a history of smoking. The new study was designed to find out whether low-dose aspirin could prolong healthy, independent living in seniors who had not shown signs of heart disease.

""For healthy people, 70 and older, who don’t have a reason to be on aspirin, such as a previous heart attack or stroke, there was no discernible benefit,"" Murray told NBC News.

The trial followed 19,114 seniors — 2,411 from the U.S. and 16,703 Australians — for an average of 4.7 years. The minimum age for Caucasian participants was 70 and 65 for African-American and Hispanic volunteers, due to their higher risk of dementia and cardiovascular disease.

At the end of the trial, 90.3 percent of the aspirin-treated patients were still alive, compared to 90.5 percent of those who received placebos. Rates of physical disability and dementia were similar between the groups. The rates of coronary heart disease, heart attacks and strokes were also similar.

The big difference between the groups was in the rate of internal bleeding. Hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding in the brain, gastrointestinal bleeding and bleeding in other sites that required transfusion or hospitalization occurred in 361, or 3.8 percent, of participant in the aspirin-treated group and 265, or 2.7 percent, of those in the placebo group.

Rise in cancer risk?

There was also an increase in cancer deaths in the aspirin-treated group, which surprised the researchers. Previous studies found aspirin may be protective against certain kinds of cancer.

""There was a small increase in the number of death overall in the aspirin group, with the largest proportion of deaths due to cancer,"" said Murray. ""It is possible pre-existing cancers may have interacted with the aspirin.""

It may ultimately turn out that there are more benefits than risks in certain populations, said the study’s lead author, John McNeil, a professor in the department of epidemiology and preventive medicine in the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at Monash University in Melbourne.

“But we have not identified results that are strikingly different,” McNeil said in an email. Further research that may identify which groups would benefit from regular aspirin use is underway, McNeil said.

Cardiologist Dr. Erin Michos called the results, ""alarming,"" saying that aspirin should be prescribed only selectively.

Big changes have occurred in preventive medicine since the original aspirin research was done, Michos told NBC News in an email. Patients now get statins to lower cholesterol and anti-hypertensive medications to lower blood pressure.

“I think it is time we started to phase out the use of aspirin broadly for the purposes of prevention in individuals who have not had a heart attack or stroke,"" said Michos, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology and director of preventive cardiology at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

Dr. Ravi Dave says aspirin may make sense for a small group of older, healthy patients, even if they haven’t already had a heart attack or stroke, such as smokers. But for healthy patients who have not had a heart attack or stroke and who are not at high risk, “I would consider taking them off,” said Dave, director of interventional cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.

That’s a decision Dr. Mark Huffman plans to make in conversations with his patients.

“Some of them will say, ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it,’” predicted Huffman, an associate professor of preventive medicine in the division of cardiology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine. “Others will say, ‘if the data suggest I might not have any benefit, I would like to take fewer pills.’”

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

WASHINGTON — FEMA Administrator Brock Long Sunday questioned the relevance of independent studies tying thousands of deaths to the aftermath of last September's hurricane in Puerto Rico, echoing President Donald Trump's criticism of those findings as Florence continues to batter the Carolinas.

Appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Long defended the president for his response to Hurricane Maria last year and argued that findings from multiple academic studies were ""all over the place.""

""I think the president is being taken out of context there,"" Long said. ""I mean, I talked to the president every day this week, and the secretary of homeland security, and we discuss what we're trying to do as a result of last year.""

“I don’t know why the studies were done,"" Long said when asked about Trump's claims that the study was ""done by Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible.""

""What we’ve got to do is figure out why people die from direct deaths, which is the wind, the water and the waves, buildings collapsing,"" Long said.

""The numbers are all over the place. FEMA doesn't count deaths. And if you take what's going on with Florence, the deaths that are verified by the local county coroners are the ones that we take.""

A George Washington University study, which was specifically targeted by the president in recent days, linked an estimated 2,975 deaths to last year's Hurricane Maria. The Puerto Rican government commissioned that study for more than $300,000.

While the study's finding was far higher than the initial death count of 64, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has accepted the George Washington analysis and declared that higher toll a ""fact"" in a statement this week in response to Trump's criticism.

Earlier studies have estimated different death tolls, some higher than the George Washington study and some lower. But all estimates are above that initial count of 64 deaths.

On Sunday, Long attempted to distinguish the direct deaths from ""indirect deaths,"" arguing that there was only a tenuous link between those and the hurricane and the federal government's response.

""The GW study looked at what happened six months after the fact,"" Long said.

""You might see more deaths indirectly occur as time goes on because people have heart attacks due to stress, they fall off their house trying to fix their roof, they die in car crashes because they went through an intersection where the stoplights weren’t working,"" he said.

He went on to add that the agency looks at ""all kinds of studies,"" noting that while spousal abuse rates go up after disasters, ""you can't blame spousal abuse after a disaster on anybody.""

Long praised the president for his support for FEMA, including the ongoing response in North and South Carolina, where Florence continues to churn. ""One thing about President Trump is that he is probably the one president that has had more support for what goes on back here. And I think he's defensive because he knows how hard these guys behind me work day in and day out for a very complex situation.""

As Florence was bearing down on the coast earlier this week, Trump revisited criticism of his administration's response in Puerto Rico a year ago.

He called the federal government's response an ""incredible unsung success"" during a Tuesday briefing, and questioned the validity of the George Washington study in the following days.

Long on Sunday also denied reports that Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen recently asked him to step down in the midst of an investigation into whether he misused government vehicles in traveling to and from his home in North Carolina on the weekends.

Politico first reported the existence of the investigation, and the Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that the White House had discussed replacing Long even as he prepared to face down Florence.

Telling NBC's Chuck Todd that he will not resign, Long defended his conduct.

""Let me go ahead and clear up all the news. Secretary Nielsen has never asked me to resign. We have a very functional and professional relationship. We talk every day. We are both totally focused on Florence,"" he said.

""I have a very critical and important role to make sure this government works on the nation's worst day through continuity in government. These vehicles are designed to provide secure communications and the program was actually developed in 2008 — it ran for me the same way it's run for anybody else. Its my understanding that maybe some policies were not developed around these vehicles that we will clear up.""","homeland security kirstjen nielsen

HONG KONG — Typhoon Mangkhut barreled into southern China on Sunday, killing two people after lashing the Philippines with strong winds and heavy rain that left at least 64 dead and dozens more feared buried in a landslide.

More than 2.4 million people had been evacuated in southern China's Guangdong province by Sunday evening to flee the massive typhoon and nearly 50,000 fishing boats were called back to port, state media reported.

Hong Kong's RTHK broadcaster cited experts as saying Mangkhut was expected to be the strongest typhoon to hit the city in decades. The Hong Kong Observatory issued its strongest storm warning for 10 hours on Sunday, just slightly shorter than the record time of 11 hours set by Typhoon York in 1999, the South China Morning Post reported.

In Guangdong, the storm killed two people a few hours after making landfall on Sunday evening and was triggering storm surges as high as 3 meters (10 feet), state broadcaster CCTV said.

Fifteen people were injured in the nearby gambling enclave of Macau, which closed casinos for the first time. The Hong Kong Observatory warned people to stay away from the Victoria Harbour landmark, where storm surges battered the sandbag-reinforced waterfront.

In Hong Kong, a video posted online by residents showed the top corner of an old building break and fall off, while in another video, a tall building swayed as strong winds blew.

The storm shattered glass windows on commercial skyscrapers in the city, sending sheets of paper pouring out of the buildings, fluttering and spiraling as they headed for the debris-strewn ground, according to several videos posted on social media.

The storm also felled trees, tore bamboo scaffolding off buildings under construction and flooded some areas of Hong Kong with waist-high waters, according to the South China Morning Post.

The paper said the heavy rains brought storm surges of 3 meters (10 feet) around Hong Kong.

The storm made landfall in the Guangdong city of Taishan at 5 p.m., packing wind speeds of 162 kilometers (100 miles) per hour. State television broadcaster CGTN reported that surging waves flooded a seaside hotel in the city of Shenzhen.

Groceries flew off the shelves of supermarkets in the provincial capital of Guangzhou as residents stocked up in anticipation of being confined at home by the typhoon, China's official Xinhua News Agency said.

Authorities in southern China issued a red alert, the most severe warning, as the national meteorological center said the densely populated region would face a ""severe test caused by wind and rain"" and urged officials to prepare for possible disasters.

Hundreds of flights were canceled. All high-speed and some normal rail services in Guangdong and Hainan provinces were also halted, the China Railway Guangzhou Group Co. said.

Hong Kong Security Minister John Lee Ka-chiu urged residents to prepare for the worst.

""Because Mangkhut will bring winds and rains of extraordinary speeds, scope and severity, our preparation and response efforts will be greater than in the past,"" Lee said. ""Each department must have a sense of crisis, make a comprehensive assessment and plan, and prepare for the worst.""

Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific said all of its flights would be canceled between 2:30 a.m. Sunday and 4 a.m. Monday. The city of Shenzhen also canceled all flights between Sunday and early Monday morning. Hainan Airlines canceled 234 flights in the cities of Haikou, Sanya, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai scheduled over the weekend.

In Macau, next door to Hong Kong, casinos were ordered to close from 11 p.m. Saturday, the first time such action was taken in the city, the South China Morning Post reported. Macau suffered catastrophic flooding during Typhoon Hato last year, leading to accusations of corruption and incompetence at its meteorological office.

In Macau's inner harbor district, the water level reached 1.5 meters (5 feet) on Sunday and was expected to rise further. The district was one of the most affected by floods from Typhoon Hato, which left 10 people dead.

In the northern Philippines, Mangkhut made landfall Saturday on the northeastern tip of Luzon island with sustained winds of 205 kilometers (127 miles) per hour and gusts of 255 kph (158 mph).

Dozens of people, mostly small-scale miners and their families, were feared to have been trapped by a landslide in the far-flung village of Ucab in Itogon town in the northern mountain province of Benguet, Itogon Mayor Victorio Palangdan told The Associated Press by phone.

Palangdan said three villagers who nearly got buried by the huge pile of mud and rocks told authorities they saw residents rush into an old three-story building, a former mining bunkhouse that has been transformed into a chapel, at the height of the typhoon's onslaught Saturday afternoon.

""That was not an authorized evacuation center,"" Palangdan said, but expressed sadness that the villagers, many of them poor miners, had few options to survive in a region where big corporations have profited immensely from gold mines.

""They were laughing off the police and disaster-response personnel who were warning them. They thought they were really safe there,"" he said.

Police Superintendent Pelita Tacio said 34 villagers had died and 36 remained missing in the landslides in Ucab and another village in Itogon town. Rescuers were scrambling to pull out the body of a victim from the mound of mud and rocks in Ucab before Tacio left the area Sunday.

""It's very sad. I could hear villagers wailing in their homes near the site of the accident,"" Tacio said by phone.

Rescuers were hampered by rain and mud, and the search and rescue operation was suspended at nightfall and will resume at daybreak Monday, Palangdan said. Police and their vehicles could not immediately reach the landslide-hit area because the ground was unstable and soaked from the heavy rains, regional police chief Rolando Nana told the ABS-CBN TV network.

Overall, at least 64 people have died in typhoon incidents in the northern Philippines, mostly from landslides and collapsed houses, according to the national police. Forty-five other people were missing and 33 were injured in the storm.

The hardest-hit area was Benguet, where 38 people died, mostly in the two landslides in Itogon, and 37 are missing, the police said.

Other deaths wrought by the storm elsewhere included a couple and their children who refused to evacuate from their house, which later got buried by a landslide in Nueva Vizcaya province. Four people died in northeastern Cagayan province, where the typhoon made landfall.

Still, the Philippines appeared to have been spared the high number of casualties many had feared. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened villages and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines. A massive evacuation ahead of Mangkhut helped lessen potential casualties, with about 87,000 people evacuating from high-risk areas, officials said.

The typhoon struck at the start of the rice and corn harvesting season in the Philippines' northern breadbasket, prompting farmers to scramble to save what they could of their crops, Cagayan Gov. Manuel Mamba said.","haikou sanya guangzhou shenzhen

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

FLEMINGTON, N.J. — Across the country, suburban GOP congressional candidates this fall have had to make a high-stakes decision: whether to run on President Donald Trump's immigration policies — or run away from them.

In New Jersey, two Republicans in strikingly similar districts have bet their political futures on sharply different answers. GOP Rep. Leonard Lance is distancing himself from President Donald Trump on immigration. Jay Webber, the Republican nominee in a neighboring and virtually identical New Jersey district, is sticking close.

Lance, now in his fifth term representing the 7th District, is among the most vulnerable incumbents in the country in a year in which control of the House is up for grabs. His race is rated as a ""tossup"" by the Cook Political Report, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the district 48.6 percent to Trump's 47.5 percent in the 2016 presidential election.

Webber, running for the 11th District seat left open by retiring Republican Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, has a more uphill battle, even though Trump won the district by a percentage point. Cook rates his race against Navy veteran and former federal prosecutor Mikie Sherrill as ""leans Democrat.""

The different tacks of these two Republicans running in two of the most competitive districts in the nation underscore the degree to which Trump's immigration rhetoric and policies have pushed the issue to the front-burner of the American political debate and highlighted the divide between GOP base voters and the rest of the electorate.

""They’re in a pickle,"" said Deborah Schildkraut, a political science professor at Tufts University in Boston of the the dilemma facing Republicans on the ballot this fall. ""The decision is either run on the Trump line on immigration or run on the more centrist Republican line on immigration, and I don’t think It’s obvious which one is the winning strategy.""

There's no denying the topic is on Americans' minds this election year: Over the summer, immigration remained solidly perched at or near the top of the lists of issues voters cited as their top priority in a string of surveys.

It has riven the Republican Party, separating political and business elites, who tend to favor centrist immigration policy, from the party's base. Trump's nomination in 2016 — and the defeat of Republicans with more moderate stances on immigration — helped highlight that the majority of GOP primary voters like his approach.

For example, a May CBS News poll showed that 59 percent of American adults opposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, a figure that has been consistent with more recent polls by NBC and others. But the CBS survey also found that 78 percent of Republicans favored the wall, compared with 13 percent of Democrats and 34 percent of independents.

Therein lies the rub: While most Republican activists across the country like what Trump's doing on immigration, that's not true of the electorate as a whole. That means, like Lance and Webber, Republicans in swing districts across the country have to make a tough calculation that could determine whether they win or lose.

Trump is deeply unpopular in New Jersey, with just 33 percent approval and 63 percent disapproval in a recent Quinnipiac poll — so it may come as little surprise that a Republican running in a competitive district would strike a different tone on his core issue, whether they embrace a majority of his immigration positions or not.

Lance supports providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he bucked Republican leaders in the House by signing a ""discharge petition"" to force a vote on extending President Barack Obama's ""DACA"" program, and he's the only Republican cosponsor of a bill introduced by Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., that would require the Trump administration to reunite families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""I believe my views are the views of the majority of the people of the United States and certainly of the people I represent,"" Lance said in a telephone interview with NBC News in which he was quick to note his differences with Trump not only on immigration but also on taxes and other matters.

His constituents here in the 7th District, a swath of suburbs sandwiched between the New York metropolitan area and the Pennsylvania border, are wealthy, well-educated and predominantly white, many of Irish, Italian and German descent. The median household income is near twice the national mark at $107,000, more than half the population has at least a bachelor's degree, compared with about one-third nationally. Rough 8 in 10 are white, with Latinos and Asians accounting for most of the rest.

And yet in the adjoining 11th District — where 82 percent are white, the median household income is $108,000 and 54 percent hold a college degree — Webber has taken a far different approach.

Webber has echoed President Trump's immigration attacks. Jeenah Moon / for NBC News

""I agree with a lot of what the president has said about immigration,"" Webber said in a telephone interview, though he added that he thought the family separation policy ""was wrong and he was right to correct it.""

Trump, Lance and Webber do strike some common notes on immigration: They're all willing to accuse Democrats of going too far to defend undocumented immigrants, and Lance voted for a more moderate House GOP immigration bill that Trump tepidly endorsed behind closed doors and criticized publicly.

Webber has more closely mirrored one of the president's top attacks, falsely accusing Sherrill of wanting to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. While some progressives have adopted that position, Sherrill has said she does not want to get rid of the bureau. ""She's trying to have it both ways,"" Webber told NBC, because she has appeared with Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who has promised to make New Jersey a ""sanctuary state.""

And despite his more moderate stance on the issue, Lance has zeroed in on his opponent Tom Malinowski's support for focusing deportation efforts on undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes beyond crossing the border without authorization.

In both districts, as is the case in swing districts across the country, immigration has grabbed the attention of voters whose Election Day decisions could help swing the balance of power in Washington.

Some, like Webber, say they support the president's overall approach. Karen Shampanore, who describes herself as a political independent from a conservative family, hasn't made up her mind about who she will vote for in the midterms. But the unemployed 48-year-old from Glen Gardner in Lance's 7th District, is certain that she's with Trump on immigration, and tired of hearing him criticized on the issue. In part, that's because she believes undocumented immigrants are doing economic harm to American citizens even though the unemployment rate in her home county of Hunterdon has been below 4 percent for nearly two years.

""They're taking a lot of our jobs and services away from us,"" Shampanore said. ""I feel like if they can survive here, they can survive where they came from.""

The president, she said, is ""doing what he can do, so you don't mock someone who's trying, because he's got a lot of people to protect.""

James McQueen, of nearby Flemington, left the Democratic Party over immigration.

""We need strong borders, I believe we need a wall,"" the 40-year-old resident of Flemington in Lance's 7th District, said in an interview with NBC News. He said he is ""100 percent for"" Trump's handling of immigration, including the suspended policy of separating families at the border to discourage illegal migration.

""We're trying to figure out who the families are,"" he said, explaining that he believes some of the kids coming across the border are being exploited by adults who falsely claim to be their parents and may be involved in human trafficking. ""There has to be separation.""

Others who sympathize with the president's position are uneasy with some elements of his administration's approach.

""I don't think the families should be separated,"" said 68-year-old Jack Ketcherick, a retired builder from Parsipanny in the 11th District. ""But [immigration] should be controlled before that happens.""

Nonetheless, he's otherwise behind the president. He voted for Webber in the Republican primary and says he will do so again in November.

In his view, Democrats are ""too lenient"" on immigration, and Republican candidates should work with the president as the leader of the party.

""If they are Republicans, they should support him,"" Ketcherick said. ""But they may be uncomfortable because he's unusual.""

In fact, some area voters are more than a bit uncomfortable: Trump's policies are ""frightening,"" said Janet Siegel, the owner of an architecture firm in Chatham, adding that the separation push was ""inhumane.""

Siegel, 55, who was previously unregistered in a party, enrolled as a Democrat for the first time so that she could vote for Sherrill in the party primary this year.

""I think it has to be handled in some way, a humane way, and the president hasn't done that,"" she said. ""That's why we need people in Congress who have a brain.""

Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said GOP candidates in competitive districts have to perform a ""sweet spot dance"" to appeal to swing voters without alienating the president's political base.

""It tends to be a little bit trickier for candidates that are not buying what Donald Trump is selling but a portion of their base vote, or voters in their district, does,"" he said. ""That’s going to be an interesting thing to watch — how effective they are in doing it.""","republican national committee

Chemists have a plan to make ghosts in the lab, by bonding an atom to a patch of empty space.

Normal chemical bonds anchor two atoms together, usually through sharing their electrons. Now, theorists have worked out how to trick a single hydrogen atom to form a bond with nothing, by luring the atom’s lone electron into the same position and state it would be in a real bond.

Minuscule glass beads brought back from the moon by Apollo astronauts seemed to show that there were far more objects smashing into the moon in the last 500 million years than the rest of the moon’s history. Now it turns out they just didn’t look deep enough, which could spell trouble for some theories about the rise of life on Earth.

If we want to avoid mass extinctions and preserve the ecosystems all plants and animals depend on, governments should protect a third of the oceans and land by 2030 and half by 2050, with a focus on areas of high biodiversity. So say leading biologists in an editorial in the journal Science this week.

It’s not just about saving wildlife, says Jonathan Baillie of the National Geographic Society, one of the authors. It’s also about saving ourselves.

“We are learning more and more that the large areas that remain are important for providing services for all life,” he says. “The forests, for example, are critical for absorbing and storing carbon.”

At present, just 3.6 per cent of the planet’s oceans and 14.7 per cent of the land is protected by law. At the 2010 Nagoya Conference of the Convention on Biological Diversity, governments agreed to protect 10 per cent of the oceans and 17 per cent of land.

Extinction crisis

But this isn’t nearly enough, says Baillie. He and his coauthor, Ya-Ping Zhang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, want governments to set much bigger targets at the next major conference in 2020.

“We have to drastically increase our ambition if we want to avoid an extinction crisis and if we want to maintain the ecosystem services that we currently benefit from,” says Baillie. “The trends are in a positive direction, it’s just we have to move much faster.”

It’s very difficult to work out how much space is needed to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem benefits, the pair say, because there’s so much we don’t know about life on Earth – like how many species there are. However, most estimates suggest that between 25 and 75 per cent of regions or major ecosystems must be protected. And we should err on the side of caution when setting targets.

Could we feed a global population that may reach 10 billion people by 2050 if half the planet is set aside? We won’t be able to do so if we don’t, says Baillie. “That’s why we need an intact planet,” he says. “If we want to feed the world’s population, we have to be thinking about maintaining the ecological systems that allow us to provide that.”

Which areas should we protect?

“There is no doubt we need far more land and sea secured for conserving and retaining nature,” says James Watson at the University of Queensland in St Lucia, Australia. “Targets like 50 per cent are in the right ball park when it comes to the minimal amount of area needed to conserve biodiversity.”

But Watson and others stress that which areas get protected is even more important than the overall number.

“The key thing is to protect the right areas,” says Jose Montoya of the Station for Theoretical and Experimental Ecology in Moulis, France. “If we merely protect a proportion of the territory, governments will likely protect what’s easy, and that’s usually areas of low biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.”

“We have to do both,” responds Baillie. “I don’t think they are mutually exclusive.”

What’s more, a third of the 3.6 per cent of land that is already meant to be protected is actually being exploited, Watson’s team reported last month. So merely declaring areas to be protected is not enough.

“These protected areas must be well managed,” says David Lindenmayer of the Australian National University in Canberra. “The basis for conservation will need to change so that it becomes a key part of economies and livelihoods.”

Fruit flies move over. A new flying robot called DelFly has flapping wings and can dodge a swatting hand with as much agility as a fruit fly.

DelFly has two thin plastic wings on each side of its body, inspired by a fruit fly. Though it’s 55 times bigger than an actual fruit fly, DelFly can do all the same aerial acrobatics. It can even perform 360-degree flips – a move flies never seem to do.

Flies perform agile evasive motion when trying to escape a threat, such as a predator or an incoming flyswatter. One particularly nimble move they perform is called a banked turn, and involves tilting their bodies to perform a sharp change in direction. Performing this motion requires sophisticated sensory and motor controls of flies, which scientists are yet to fully understand.

Matěj Karásek at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and his colleagues used DelFly to test potential flight control strategies used by fruit flies. The robot was preprogramed to use similar wing movements and body rotation patterns of real fruit flies as captured by high-speed cameras in previous research.

DelFly can help researchers gain insights into insect flight control, says Matěj Karásek, who led the work. One area that robotics is helping is why flies continue to drift sideways after a banked turn. It was thought that this drift was undesirable to fruit flies, because they appear to lose control over their flight trajectory and initially DelFly did the same.

However, the team were able to remove this sideways drift by adjusting DelFly’s head orientation to align with its body right after a turn. Surprisingly this tweak didn’t actually impact DelfFly’s turning speed or agility, suggesting that there is no need for flies to avoid drifting.

“Fruit flies either don’t care — they just want to escape as fast as possible — or they still want to keep looking at the danger,” says Karásek.

Next, the team aim to make DelFly fully autonomous, so that it can fly without human pilots.

The latest Apple Watch will give people warnings if their heart rate goes too high or low and let them take a readout of their heart’s electrical activity.

It’s being billed as a giant leap in home healthcare – but critics say it will lead to huge numbers of people getting told they have heart problems when they don’t.

The Series 4 watch will go on sale in the US later this month costing $399, Apple announced at the product launch yesterday, calling the device “an intelligent guardian for your health”.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is normally just available in hospital. Pads put onto your chest detect your heart’s electrical activity, which is shown as the well-known spiky line on a monitor.

Now Apple Watch users will be able to get an ECG at the touch of a button, by putting a finger on the “digital crown” on the watch’s side, similar to the winder on a clockwork watch. After 30 seconds, you get told if the result is normal or suggests a problem, and the recording can be shared with a doctor.

Worrying readings

The last Apple Watch could also be used to take an ECG if paired with a device called a Kardia Band, but this had to be bought separately. Having the function built into the watch will mean many more people will start regularly taking their ECG, especially if they worry about their health – and that’s where problems may start.

The feature will be useful for some people, namely those who have a condition called atrial fibrillation, where the heart beats irregularly, causing symptoms such as breathlessness, tiredness and chest pain. They sometimes need home monitoring.

But many people have an irregular heart rhythm without symptoms. They will be told by their watch to take the ECG result to a doctor. They could then get potentially risky surgery, go on unnecessary medications risking side effects such as dizziness. At the least they will be falsely alarmed.

Several trials have investigated whether it is helpful to give ECGs to people without symptoms and the US Preventive Services Task Force has concluded that the evidence fails to show this approach does more good than harm.

New Scientist has asked Apple if the company has any specific measures to avoid misdiagnosis, but has yet to receive a response.

Another function, the intermittent heart rate monitor – which works though sensors built into the back of the watch face – may also have potential for false alarms. For instance, some people get panic attacks, when stress makes their heart and breathing rate race.

And there’s a third new medical feature aimed at people who have health concerns – this will call emergency services if the wearer is detected to have taken a hard fall and stays immobile for 60 seconds.

All such functions will no doubt be appreciated by people with health concerns – not to mention the worried well.","karl mondondigital first mediathe mercury

An antioxidant food supplement widely used to treat conditions including paracetamol poisoning has shown promise in helping mice with osteoarthritis, the most common joint disorder in the world. The only existing treatments are painkillers and drugs that reduce inflammation, but nothing halts or reverses the condition.

When researchers added N-acetyl cysteine, or NAC, to the drinking water they gave to mice with osteoarthritis, it reduced the level of joint damage to that seen in healthy, control mice. The main effect of the NAC was to stifle damage to cartilage tissue in joints, which is caused by a natural process in cells called oxidative stress.

Rik Lories of the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, and his colleagues screened gene activity in cartilage samples from people and mice with osteoarthritis. They discovered depleted levels of a protein called ANP32A. Further gene-profiling experiments in diseased and healthy joint cartilage cells revealed that ANP32A drives production of a natural enzyme which halts oxidative stress.

This suggests oxidative stress in cartilage cells is a key cause of osteoarthritis – and that a therapy to neutralise the problem could treat the condition. Lories and his team decided to find out using NAC – an antioxidant which neutralises oxidative stress.

When the researchers bred mice unable to make ANP32A, the animals developed severe osteoarthritis. But treating them with NAC healed their joints, reducing cartilage damage to levels seen in healthy control animals.

Lories says that in people with osteoarthritis, NAC may not reach cartilage in sufficient amounts to heal damage. His team plans to focus instead on finding ways to boost ANP32A. “Restoration of its [natural] levels in osteoarthritic cartilage may provide better protection against oxidative stress,” he says.

His political support has since changed as Klarman is now donating to Democratic initiatives, according to the New York Times’ analysis of Klarman’s Federal Election Commission filings, set to be released on September 20.

The Times’ report, released Saturday, revealed Klarman intends to donate some $20 million to Democrats by 2020. The 61-year-old has shelled out $4.9 million to the Democratic Party so far, including donations to about 150 candidates like Joe Kennedy, Connor Lamb, Beto O’Rourke, Kirsten Gillibrand and several others. He’s also dished out $3 million to help Democrats take back the House and Senate in the upcoming November primaries.

Klarman told the Times his generosity towards Democrats—although he doesn’t identify as one—was his way of ensuring a “check on Donald Trump’s runaway presidency.”

The investor, who is worth $1.5 billion, according to Forbes, noted Trump’s poor treatment of immigrants and lack of regard for minorities, in addition to Republican voter suppression, as his reasoning behind his sudden change in political donations. Calling the Republican Party “spineless” and unwilling to stand up to the president, Klarman said donating to Democrats to help ensure they take back the House and Senate was the only way to “act as a check and balance.”

To do that, Klarman, who donated to more than $7 million to Republicans in 2016, plans to up the ante in his contributions for Democrats.

“If one looks at my past giving, one night think that several million, five or six million, might be a lot in cycle,” he told the Times. “I’m stretching far beyond what I usually do.”

He continued: “By the election I think I’ll have spent between $18 and $20 million.”

Klarman’s aid towards the Democrats is just another sign of the Republican party’s shrinking support. Forty percent of all voters in party registration states were listed as Democrats, according to an analysis conducted by the University of Virginia Center for Politics, released in July. Meanwhile, only 29 percent of registered voters across the U.S. were considered Republican in the report.","university of virginia center

""I caught up on my napping a lot,"" he told USA Today Saturday. He claimed the storm was not bad, and he’d wait it out on his boat again. Hurricane Florence hit land 50 miles Northeast of Cloer’s boat, named “Later,” on Friday. He admitted the weather made for a rocky experience, as the boat was “kicked around. He also said that the winds, which arrived in 60 mph gusts, sounded like a freight train passing by. He briefly left the boat to view the winds from dock’s clubhouse.

""When they really got tough, I went up to the clubhouse up here and sat on the front porch and watched them go by,"" he said. ""They were rolling. I think we dodged a bullet.""

Cloer said he wasn’t afraid of the winds or the storm in general. He noted multiple global news outlets have reached out for his story. ""If that's my 15 minutes of fame, I got it,"" he said.

His story was first shared in an article evaluating the movements of boat owners during the storm, USA Today reported Wednesday. Cloer admitted he was nervous, as others on the dock feared for the safety of their boats. He was not deterred from staying, though.

Eric and Barbara Coates are boat owners who decided to stay the storm as well, though not on their boat. “We’ll be staying here and hoping the boat is still here when it’s done,” Eric told USA Today. “I’ve been in some storms, but this one could be fun.”

Twelve people have died in the storm so far, the New York Times reported Saturday. Some deaths have been caused by flooding. Two people died when a tree fell on their home. Around 670,000 people are without power in the Carolinas, ABC11 reported Sunday. Hurricane Florence was downgraded from a Category 1 storm when it hit landfall to a tropical storm. It began its journey toward the coast as a Category 4 hurricane.

The attack, which took place at Newcomb Hollow Beach in Wellfleet, was only the second recorded death from a shark recorded in Massachusetts since 1936. Arthur Medici, the victim, came from the city of Revere and was about 30 feet out from shore and a quarter mile down from the main part of the beach when he was attacked, witnesses told local media.

“I saw two guys in the water boogie boarding and one got engulfed. The thrashing was unprecedented,” Joe Booth Jr., a witness who was at the beach to surf, told The Boston Herald .

“It had to be a 10- to 12-foot shark. His buddy frantically got him out. He’s a hero because he knew what was in the water,” Booth, 33, continued. “The amount of volatility was scary. He got nailed ... That shark went in for the kill and then let him go.”

Town Administrator Dan Hoort and Wellfleet Selectboard Chair Janet Reinhart released a statement about the tragic death, saying the town is “heartbroken.”

“We send our sympathies to his family and the friends of this young man. We share the grief and pain you feel. We are grateful to the family, friends, beach staff, public and first responders who worked so valiantly to save his life,” the said, according to CBS Boston.

Despite the efforts of those on the beach, who performed CPR, Medici was pronounced dead at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis.

This marks the second shark attack off of the popular summertime destination this summer. In August, 61-year-old William Lytton was bitten in Truro, but survived the attack. He claimed to have punched the predator in the gills.

A sign by Newcomb Hollow Beach warns beachgoers to “be shark smart.” Experts also told The Boston Herald that there has been a noticeable increase in shark sightings, as their main prey, seals, move closer to shore.

“The bottom line is depth plays a major role here,” Greg Skomal, the state’s top shark expert told the local newspaper. “Seals are coming closer to the beach. That means sharks are patrolling close to the beach, and that’s when you get the overlap with humans.”

Although local residents are concerned, Philip Hoare, an author who writes about sea creatures and who frequents the beaches off of Cape Cod, pointed out that shark attacks, and particularly fatalities, are quite rare.

“Although 42 percent of shark attacks worldwide have occurred in North American waters, with 1,657 incidents recorded since 1900, only 144 unprovoked attacks to 2016 have been fatal,” Hoare wrote for The Guardian . “This year has seen 28 shark attacks in the U.S. – 14 provoked – just two of which have been fatal.”","newcomb hollow beach

The constant rain mixed with strong winds is slated to increase the risk of flooding, makin restoring power to people in North and South Carolina more difficult.

Duke Energy, one of the biggest electricity providers in North and South Carolina, was able to restore power to some customers on Saturday. The company said more than 637,000 customers had their electricity turned back on as of Saturday morning, but winds and rainfall throughout the night brought additional outages.

More than 670,000 people remained without power in North Carolina as of Sunday, ABC News' North Carolina affiliate reported. The most effected areas include cities within the following counties: Beaufort, Bladen, Brunswick, Carteret, Columbus Craven, Duplin, New Hanover, Robeson, Sampson, Wake, Wayne, Pamlico, Pender and Onslow.

Meanwhile nearly 59,000 in South Carolina were still in the dark.

Duke energy said it could take several days for all outages to be restored due to continued high winds, heavy rainfall, flooding and blocked roads damaged by the storm. “Our crews during the past 24 hours have made significant progress restoring power in areas of the Carolinas where it is safe to do,"" Howard Fowler, Duke Energy incident commander, said in a statement.

“However, we unfortunately have been unable to make repairs in some of the hardest-hit coastal areas due to continuing high winds and road access problems caused by major flooding,"" Fowler said.

He added: “In those hard-hit areas, total power restoration might take weeks, not days, due to widespread flooding and significant damage to power lines, utility poles and other key components of the electric grid.”

Tropical Depression Florence’s path is headed northwest and is expected to move across the western Carolinas and then recurve over the Ohio Valley and Northeast U.S. on Monday and Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said in a statement released early Sunday. The projected pathway is expected to bring flash flooding from heavy rainfall to those residing in the western areas of North Carolina.

“The flood danger from this storm is more immediate today than when it... made landfall 24 hours ago,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said in a statement on Saturday. “We face walls if water at our coasts, along our rivers, across our farmland, in our cities and in our towns.”

The catastrophic storm has so far resulted in the deaths of 13 people, including a mother and her child in Wilmington, North Carolina.","abc news north carolina affiliate

A bridge collapsed, and two dams performed controlled releases to avoid calamitous failures.

The infrastructural failures emphasized the dire state of public facilities. A year later, as rain from Hurricane Florence continues to cascade and storm surges lash coastal areas, infrastructure in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia is at risk. While the hurricane's impact will be damaging, it won't be a surprise.

""What I took away from Harvey is everything that we knew could happen did happen,"" former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Wayne Klotz told Newsweek. ""I guarantee you the engineers in North and South Carolina will feel the same.""

The ASCE 2017 Infrastructure Report Card, which ranks an array of U.S. systems, gave the country a D+. The nation's bridges received a C+, while its wastewater treatment plants were given a D+. Dams were given a D grade.

Almost 10 percent of bridges in South Carolina and over 10 percent in North Carolina were structurally deficient, according to the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. Only 5.9 percent of Virginia bridges were structurally deficient, a description which Klotz said meant they were carrying loads that they were not designed to hold -- not that they would imminently collapse.

""There's not a lot of bridges waiting to fall down,"" he told Newsweek. But he also said the structures were not designed ""to accommodate three to four feet of rain at a time."" CBS News reported that ""more than 16 inches of rain have fallen in southeast North Carolina and another 20 to 25 inches is on the way,"" citing the National Hurricane Center.

When this happens, Klotz said, water traveling at high velocities scours away the soil around bridge columns, jeopardizing the support system. While bridge collapses are rare, the damage could require repairs.

Dams in the Carolinas were neglected, as well.

South Carolina has 178 high hazard dams, which the government defines as a facility ""where failure will probably cause loss of human life. Such facilities are generally located in populated areas or where dwellings are found in the flood plain and failure can reasonably be expected to cause loss of life; serious damage to homes, industrial and commercial buildings; and damage to important utilities, highways, or railroads.""

More than 1,400 of North Carolina's 5,700 dams are classified as high hazard, the Charlotte Observer reported. While these dams were not likely to rupture, according to Klotz, they could need to release excess water during Florence, causing downstream flooding.

And while power loss is expected, the outages can have derivative impacts. More than 700,000 people have lost power, AccuWeather reported.

In heavy storms, the outages lead to health impacts. ""Power loss can also affect water treatment facilities, which can be damaged,"" policy analyst at Bipartisan Policy Center Jake Varn told Newsweek. Electricity failures -- or flooding -- could also disable waste water plants, leading to sewage overflows, Klotz said. ""Most waste water plants are located near waterways. If you get heavy enough flooding, you can also knock wastewater plants offline.""

While dangerous, some of these potential infrastructure failures were avoidable, Klotz, Varn and Director of Infrastructure at Bipartisan Policy Center Michele Nellenbach told Newsweek.

""We've underinvested in all these resources for the last couple of decades. We didn't keep up in terms of operations and maintenance,"" Nellenbach said.

New, stronger and more environmentally sustainable materials are available, but public funding has not been used to upgrade degraded structures, Klotz said.

""Candidly, for the last 30 to 40 years we have just chosen at the public level not to adequately maintain our infrastructure,"" he told Newsweek. ""None of it’s free. You tell the public it’s going to cost this many dollars to fix this treatment plant and we might have to charge you more on your water rates, and that’s the end of the conversation.""","american road and transportation builders association only

You’re not the only one. A new poll from Gallup indicates that global misery is at its worst since the company began surveying worldwide emotions more than 10 years ago.

Gallup’s annual Global Emotions Report surveyed 154,000 people across more than 145 countries and established that 2017 was a deeply miserable year, with humans worldwide suffering from sadness, stress, worry, anger and physical pain more frequently than in any previous years.

This means civilization is the most negative it has been since Gallup started its global emotions survey in 2005. The worst misery scores had formerly been jointly held by 2015 and 2016, but last year’s war, political division and humanitarian crises seems to have pushed people over the edge.

Almost four out of every 10 people surveyed said they experienced stress or worry the previous day. One in five reported anger, 24 percent sadness and 31 percent physical pain. Overall, 2017 posted a misery score of 30 compared with 28 in 2015 and 2016.

Mohamed Younis, Gallup's managing editor, wrote, “Collectively, the world is more stressed, worried, sad and in pain today than we've ever seen it.”

“Regardless of where a country may fall on the Positive or Negative Experience Indexes or where it ranks in terms of specific positive or negative experiences, all leaders need to be monitoring the emotional temperature of the people they lead,” he added.

The Central African Republic (CAR), where more than 600,000 people have been displaced by civil war and associated outbreaks of violence in recent years, was the most negative country in the world. It took the dubious honor from previous holder Iraq.

Gallup said the CAR remains so dangerous that it could not interview anyone from certain parts of the country. Nonetheless, its score of 61 was the worst ever recorded by pollsters.

Other particularly low-scoring nations were South Sudan, Chad, Sierra Leone and Egypt. Sub-Saharan Africa generally experienced worsening misery.

But Latin American citizens are enjoying a boon in happiness, according to the survey results, with the region once again ranked as the most positive in the world.

Paraguay scored the highest on the Positive Experience Index, which ranks nations on whether people smiled, felt enjoyment, did something interesting, were well-rested and treated with respect the previous day.

Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala and Canada came in behind Paraguay’s contented citizens. Iceland was the only European nation to break into the happiest 12 nations, with Indonesia and Uzbekistan representing Asia.

Younis suggested the survey provides a vital perspective into the human experience, but noted the values must be seen in a long-term context. “Our research over the years has taught us that tracking how people are experiencing their lives is arguably more important than what their overall score is in one single year,” he explained.

“Although developments on a national and global level tend to dominate news headlines, capturing the trends of hope—or despair—at the individual level provides the most valuable intelligence.”","florent vergnesafpgetty images gallup

This is the true story from the man who created it, Craig Fugate",http://www.newsweek.com/craig-fugate-explains-waffle-house-index-1120655,https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/09/13/craig-fugate-explains-how-waffle-house-index-came-be.jpg,general,2018-09-16 14:23:31.214622,"The iconic yellow sign. The cheap, yet popular food. The lights that never seem to dim, even as hurricanes and natural catastrophes bare down on the communities around them.

The late CNN’s Anthony Bourdain perhaps had the best description of the diner-like restaurant chain that serves hot meals 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

“It is indeed marvelous. An irony-free zone where everything is beautiful and nothing hurts,” Bourdain once said. “Where everybody, regardless of race, creed, color or degree of inebriation, is welcomed. It’s warm, yellow glow, a beacon of hope and salvation, inviting the hungry, the lost, the seriously hammered all across the south to come inside. A place of safety and nourishment. It never closes. It is always faithful, always there for you.”

Waffle House is home to one of the most well-known unofficial indicators used by FEMA to measure the severity of natural disasters: The ""Waffle House Index."" The restaurant chain even has a ""Waffle House News"" Twitter account and a Waffle House Storm Center. FEMA offers live tracking to show which of the chain's restaurants have closed and which remain open, a feature that will undoubtedly be looked at by East Coast residents in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Florence.

But the birth of the unusual storm indicator was not on purpose. Former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate is the man behind the infamous Waffle House Index. He spoke to Newsweek on Thursday to tell the story of how a morning ritual and a casual observation turned into a nationwide indicator used by the government and millions of people to assess storm damage.

As the man who once ran Florida's Division of Emergency Management, Fugate’s job took him to southwest Florida in 2004 to survey the destruction left by Hurricane Charley. The Category 4 storm made landfall near Fort Myers, causing catastrophic damage for a storm that was relatively small in size compared to other hurricanes. State officials and meteorologists joined Fugate to inspect the damage-stricken region in the days after Charley.

“We wanted to get something to eat because the day would be packed and didn’t know when we’d get to eat again,” said Fugate, describing their search for breakfast one morning after the storm. “But there was nothing open.”

So, Fugate and his crew drove south along the interstate until they came across a Waffle House that was open for business. However, the restaurant only had a partial menu. The power had gone out, rendering some of the products in the freezer unusable. “But it was a hot breakfast,” Fugate said. “We ate and went on about the day.”

The next morning, Fugate and his crew noticed a different Waffle House near their hotel had reopened. “We went in there and it was the same deal: Limited menu and it had just gotten power back up,” Fugate said.

By this time, surrounding counties were requesting state aid from Fugate to help with recovery efforts. He and his team had begun monitoring indicators like school closures, power outages and search-and-rescue operations to determine what areas were in the most immediate need. They provided a color-coded map of the area to give local agencies and the public a better perspective as to where the severity of damage was located and where the state would begin administering help first.

“Well, my guys slipped in an image about the Waffle House Index,” Fugate said. “By now, we had figured out where the Waffle Houses were closed, which had no power or limited menus, and which ones were open. If they weren’t closed and had a full menu, you were moving well into recovery operations and it was much more stable.”

The Waffle House Index became comprised of three color-coded levels: Green, yellow and red. If a Waffle House was fully open and operational, the storm’s damage was likely minimal in the area. Businesses were reopening and other services were becoming fully operational, receiving a green stamp of approval. If a Waffle House only had a partial menu, it was a yellow warning sign that the area was undergoing problems of possible power outages or lack of running water. Other restaurants were most likely closed and daily life had yet to resume to normal. But if a Waffle House was closed, that was bad news. It meant the area was most severely hit and still struggling to recover.

“If you’re sending teams into an area of impact and they start seeing damages, is this an area where they need to stop and go to work in, or do they keep going? If you stopped the first time you came across a downed-tree, how do you know you’re in the most heavily-impacted area?” Fugate said. ""In many cases, the Waffle Houses were one of those indicators.”

Fugate and his crew determined that if you got to the interstate and the Waffle House was up and running, it’s most likely not the most impacted area. “Keep going,” Fugate said. “If you got to an area and the Waffle House is open but there’s a limited menu, you knew you had power outages that were compromising freezers. If you got to areas where the Waffle House was closed, that’s not a good sign. That’s probably a place you need to start going to work.”

More natural disasters, including three additional hurricanes that directly hit Florida that year, forced Fugate and his team to travel the state. There was one indicator that came back time and time again that best represented where the worst storm damage was located after a major weather event. “The one thing that was true for almost any disaster was if there was anything open or got open first, it was a Waffle House,” Fugate said.

By the time Fugate was appointed as the head of FEMA in May 2009 by then-President Barack Obama, the Waffle House Index ""had followed me there,” Fugate said.

Fugate remembered responding to a deadly tornado that had torn through Joplin, Missouri, in 2011. The storm had left more than 100 people dead. Joplin's water system had been damaged so badly that there was no water pressure, leaving the entire city's residents and businesses without running water.

But that ""always faithful, always there for you” restaurant chain that Anthony Bourdain admired so much was ready to serve the community. The local Waffle House was still open, and it’s where Fugate and his crew headed to breakfast. The restaurant had found a way around the water pressure issue to remain open, unlike the various other businesses in the area.

“They were making coffee by pouring bottled water into the coffee maker, and they were serving breakfast with plastic plates and utensils because they couldn’t wash anything,"" Fugate recalled. ""But it was hot coffee and a hot meal to start the day.”

When he was leaving the restaurant, Fugate and his team noticed several cars appeared to be parked at the Starbucks about a block away. But when they got closer, they realized the people weren’t there for the coffee. The Starbucks wasn’t even open.

“[Starbucks] didn’t turn off their Wi-Fi, so people were pulling up to the Starbucks to get access to the internet,” Fugate said. “But because there was no water, they weren’t open.""

Waffle House has become a place for residents and first responders to often receive their first meal after a natural disaster, offering a fleeting moment of normalcy for those severely impacted. As those in Hurricane Florence's path begin to recover, the yellow glow of their local Waffle House could likely provide assurance there's a hot meal waiting for them just around the corner.

""Go down to the Waffle House, they’re making coffee by pouring water in the coffee maker out of bottles of water. It kind of shows you the different philosophies,"" Fugate said. ""Waffle House gets open, while everyone else has to wait for the infrastructure to allow them to reopen.""","waffle house is open

As of midday Sunday, at least 15 deaths have been blamed on Hurricane Florence, which has moved over the western parts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and eastern Tennessee. More than 700,000 are without power in North and South Carolina, and more than 500 people have had to be rescued from flooded coastal areas.

Florence, now a tropical depression, was crawling inland slower than a person can walk on Saturday, and bringing relentless bands of heavy rain as it went. It sped up on Sunday — which should help — but authorities are still warning that the biggest danger from the storm is now arriving: catastrophic flooding, and possibly landslides, as inland rainfall overwhelms the region’s already swollen waterways. Life-threatening flooding conditions are expected to intensify in many downstream areas on Sunday and Monday, and communities along some rivers have already been ordered to evacuate. All told, the storm is expected to deposit some 18 trillion gallons of rainwater on seven states across seven days — enough to cover the entire state of Texas in four inches of water. On Saturday, meteorologists warned that the region might only be a third of the way through that deluge.

The Forecast and Ongoing Risk

Florence was downgraded to a tropical depression early Sunday, and though it has picked up its pace, through Saturday the storm had barely moved since making landfall, traveling inland at only two miles-per-hour. The record-setting heavy rainfall continues to be the primary threat from the massive storm, which as of Sunday morning had the western parts of North and South Carolina. Southwest Virginia was also threatened by floodwaters from the storm starting Sunday.

“It is the water, it’s the surge, it’s the rain that effects and can kill you more than the wind can in a hurricane,” FEMA Associate Administrator Jeff Byard warned on Saturday.

As of Sunday morning, parts of three states, including almost all of North Carolina, were threatened by dangerous flooding. The region’s rivers and streams are all continuing to rise, and many are not expected to crest until as late as Wednesday, according to North Carolina governor Roy Cooper. Many cities and towns along multiple rivers — the Cape Fear, the Little River, the Lumber, the Neuse, the Waccamaw and the Pee Dee — are expected to flood. One hundred miles inland, 7,500 people along parts of the Cape Fear and Little rivers, including some residents of Fayetteville, were ordered to evacuate their homes on Saturday. That evacuation is unlikely to be the last.

“More people now face imminent threat than when the storm was just offshore,” Governor Cooper said on Sunday. “I cannot overstate it: Floodwaters are rising, and if you aren’t watching for them, you are risking your life — even in places that don’t typically flood.”

Florence is forecast to move west and north on Sunday, heading over eastern Tennessee, then Kentucky, West Virginia, and Ohio. Many of the states in Florence’s path have already experienced heavy rains this summer, leaving them waterlogged and particularly vulnerable to flooding. Some waterways in the Carolinas had already seen water levels 20 feet above average.

About 11 million people live in the areas that have been under storm watches and warnings from Florence, and many meteorologists have made an ominous connection between the behavior of Florence and last year’s Hurricane Harvey, which swamped the Houston area with the worst rain-induced flooding in American history — mostly after being downgraded from a hurricane. A team of climate scientists warned last week that big, slow, extremely wet storms like Harvey and Florence are probably going to become more common as the effects of global climate change intensify. Put another way, measuring extreme storms by their wind speed, as is done with the category system for hurricanes, may no longer be a sufficient way to anticipate their impact. Some have called Florence a category 5 flood threat.

About 20,000 people had holed up in Red Cross shelters in the region ahead of the storm, after more than 1.5 million people were ordered to evacuate in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Authorities are warning those who left not to come back until the danger has passed.

PSA: Random idiots aside, judging people who didn’t evacuate is shitty. Uprooting for a few days is spendy, and a recent study showed 40% of Americans can’t even cover a $400 emergency expense. Don’t be a jerk. — shauna (@goldengateblond) September 14, 2018

Florence had strengthened to a Category 4 storm earlier in the week, but was downgraded to a Category 1 on Thursday night. By the time it made landfall in North Carolina at 7:15 a.m., the storm was whipping winds at 90 mph. It was downgraded to a tropical storm later Friday, then again to a tropical depression on Sunday, with winds as high as 38 mph.

The Death Toll

15 deaths have been linked to the storm so far, including ten in North Carolina.

A mother and her infant were killed when a tree fell on their home in Wilmington, North Carolina on Friday.

In Kinston, a 78-year-old man was electrocuted while trying to plug in a generator, and a 77-year-old man was found dead, apparently as a result of being knocked down by strong winds.

In Pender County, a woman died on Friday from cardiac arrest at her home after emergency responders were prevented from reaching her by impassable roads.

In Duplin County, which is inland, three people died after their cars were swept away by floodwaters.

A Florence-linked housefire took the life of a husband and wife.

An 81-year-old man was killed after he fell and hit his head while preparing to evacuate

In South Carolina, a 61-year-old woman was killed when she hit a fallen tree with her car.

The circumstances of the other four reported deaths from the storm are not yet clear.

“Our hearts go out to the families of those who died in this storm,” North Carolina governor Roy Cooper said in a statement on Friday. “Hurricane Florence is going to continue its violent grind across our state for days. Be extremely careful and stay alert.”

The Damage So Far: Historic Flooding and Widespread Power Outages

Southeast North Carolina has taken the brunt of the storm, with several areas suffering through flood emergencies.

More than 400 people had to be rescued in New Bern, North Carolina, after Florence’s historic storm surge, measured at 10.1 feet above ground level, forced two rivers from their banks and resulted in the worst flooding residents have ever seen in the coastal town. Some people had to be helped from the attics and rooftops of their homes. The town was still bracing for more flooding on Sunday, as inland rainwater made its way back to them.

Almost a million people had lost power because of the storm by Saturday, but recovery crews reduced that number to around 740,000 by Sunday, mostly in North Carolina. As many as three million outages had been predicted. Tens of thousands of utility workers have been brought into the region to assist.

In Wilmington, where a foot of rain has already fallen, an all-time-record water level was recorded on Friday as Florence made landfall, qualifying the storm as a 1-in-a-100-year weather event.

With his third feature, an adaptation of James Baldwin’s novel If Beale Street Could Talk, Barry Jenkins has cemented his style: lush romance on top, hyper-realistic despair just beneath the surface. The title is symbolic: The film takes place in Manhattan and not on the Memphis Street where the blues were said to have been born. Beale Street, for Baldwin, is a condition of black life in America, and the story it would tell “if it could talk” is the one presented here: a girl; a boy; an unjust accusation; and a huge extended family full of wildly disparate men and women scrambling to save the boy from the fate of so many young black American men.

Jenkins opens If Beale Street Could Talk with a long, overhead traveling shot of two absolutely beautiful young people, 19-year-old Tish (KiKi Layne), who narrates, and 22-year-Fonny (Stephan James), on the night when they’ve decided to become lovers. It turns out that this magic-in-the-moonlight moment — the kind that, in Moonlight, Jenkins transformed into a myth of self-discovery — is a flashback, and that Fonny (short for Alonzo) now sits in jail, charged with a rape that he’s so obviously not guilty of that the prosecutor would be a laughingstock if Fonny weren’t black and the white cop who put him in a lineup not bent on settling a score.

Jenkins and cinematographer James Laxton’s palette is rich and warm, its colors deepened by a score by Nicholas Britell that ranges from a distant, forlorn trumpet to a string quartet in which the players dig in as if they’re having their own dialogue between hope and despair. The close-ups are immense, the emotions archetypal. And then, while Tish narrates, come stark, black-and-white photographs of men, woman, and children surrounded by filth and handled brutally by white cops — a sudden chiaroscuro in a film so rich in reds and golds and browns. Baldwin’s words come at as like a slap:

“Though the death took many forms, though people died early in many different ways, the death itself was very simple and the cause was simple, too: as simple as a plague: the kids had been told that they weren’t worth shit and everything they saw around them proved it. They struggled, they struggled, but they fell, like flies, and they congregated on the garbage heaps of their lives, like flies.”

Jenkins uses that passage in the film, though he omits Tish’s rather pragmatic admission that perhaps she “clung to Fonny because he was the only boy [she] knew who wasn’t fooling around.” But it’s hard to fault Jenkins for swooning over this cast: the broad-shouldered Colman Domingo with his lusciously deep voice as Tish’s dad, who’ll do anything to make his family happy; Regina King, her features exquisitely empathetic, as Tish’s mom, who treks to Puerto Rico on a seemingly hopeless mission to convince her future son-in-law’s damaged, terrified accuser to recant her identification of Fonny; and Brian Tyree Henry as Fonny’s big, once happy-go-lucky friend, shattered now after a stint in prison that was, all things considered, shorter than might have been but still a racist outrage. It’s Henry’s character who warns Fonny, a gifted sculptor of wood and metal who’d otherwise have no reason to fear white people, “The white man has got to be the devil.”

If Beale Street Could Talk drifts back and forth between Tish and Fonny’s wondrous expectations before the arrest, and the lonely quest to get the charges dropped once Fonny is inside and Tish is carrying a baby. At times, Jenkins does too much of the work for us — he pre-chews the material, which he never did in Moonlight or Medicine for Melancholy. He photographs the white cop who’s instantly enraged by Fonny as if he really is the devil (and if the devil had bad skin). It’s melodrama bordering on florid opera. Jenkins’s Moonlight-jukebox moment comes before Fonny and Tish make love, when there’s close up of a needle dropping on vinyl: a hackneyed image, however transcendent the music. On the other hand, a montage of customers after Tish gets a job at a perfume counter is overpoweringly eerie. Her monologue climaxes with the arrival of a “typical white customer,” who will spray perfume on Tish’s hand “and carry his flesh to your nostrils and he will hold it there, hold it for a lifetime.” Jenkins makes visceral the feeling that, more than a century after the freeing of slaves, black men and women feel owned. Tish’s pregnancy is a near-monstrous reminder of a world in which she’ll be bringing a child into the world and raising it without a father. The kicks are violent, incapacitating.

In Jenkins’s work, loss is a given. He lyricizes it and sometimes seems to wallow in it. Baldwin’s novel — and Tish’s narrative voice — gives him a means of expressing anger. The absurd reaction to the Black Lives Matter in much of the country (Blue Lives Matter! All Lives Matter!) purposely — criminally — ignores the slogan’s reason for being: that historically, Black Lives Didn’t Matter for Shit. Fonny, an artist who might never realize his potential, let alone be a functioning husband and father, is one example in the story Beale Street tells. The others are encompassed by Billy Preston’s mournful, ironic rendition of “My Country ‘Tis of Thee,” which closes the film and suggests that there is actually no medicine for this kind of melancholy.","magicinthemoonlight

By the time I arrived at Bob Woodward’s townhouse in Georgetown on Friday morning, his latest book, Fear, was already in its ninth printing, with more copies sold on just the first day of its release than there are people living in the city of Washington.

Through the perspective of his sources, Woodward paints a choppy portrait of the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency. You may have heard that it’s not going well, and Fear is here to add to that perception with some behind-the-scenes specifics. For instance, that Trump doesn’t understand how U.S. trade policy might relate to U.S. foreign policy. Or that when papers are stolen off his desk, he doesn’t notice — and doesn’t even remember that they existed — for weeks. Or that he orders his tweets printed out, so that he can study in analog the metrics of their reach. Or that he called his own attorney general “mentally retarded.”

The book unfolds as a series of stories about the officials and staffers in the administration who, to prevent catastrophes both domestic and international, must expertly navigate their relationship with the president, or hatch plots to distract him or coax him away from his most destructive whims.

Trump has responded to all of this in the most predictable of ways, amplifying the book through his tantrums against Woodward. Since the first details about its contents were published last week, it’s felt as though Fear is everywhere.

In Georgetown, however, it was literally true: Entering the author’s home required walking past a stack of the books on the floor. It’s a warm and colorful place, full of eye-catching paintings and, at this particular moment, lots of people and one medium-size dog. Woodward introduced me to his wife, the journalist Elsa Walsh, and then ushered me into a dining room. Over the course of 50 minutes, we discussed his philosophy and methods. But first, my tape recorder malfunctioned in front of America’s most famous journalist.

I wanted to begin with the end of the book. You decided to close with a quote, attributed to John Dowd as what he wanted to say to the president.

That he’s a … “You’re a fucking liar.”

Why that quote?

Because in many ways the book and the Trump presidency are about the war on truth. That is evident throughout and that his lawyer who worked with him for eight months, was a supporter of his, felt that he could not insult him and tell him that he was a fucking liar but that was his conclusion. That is documented in the book and the relationship that Dowd had with Trump: “You can’t testify. Testify means an orange jumpsuit.”

I wanted to talk to you about how you decide who is credible. It is difficult for me, sometimes, to determine who is credible, even at the most senior levels of the administration at this White House. Mostly at the most senior levels in some ways.

﻿Particularly if it is on the record and public. It is kind of a press release.

I agree to a large extent. But I am curious how you decide who is credible. Because somebody like Rob Porter, he is obviously very present in this book. I won’t guess about your sourcing. There is a lot to suggest that his character is — there is a fundamental flaw there.

﻿In what way?

Well, by some personal accounts he is a very flawed human being. He is allegedly abusive. There is a lot to call into question his honesty.

Say that again.

There is a lot to suggest that he may not be an honest individual, right? So why do you decide to trust somebody like that?

﻿Well, I am not going into the sourcing but there are — you test it with other people and documents and notes and it makes a big difference when somebody tells you something and you get your hand on the document itself. So because I had the luxury of time, of essentially two years to work on this, not quite, even. Ever since Trump was elected you can cross-check and see.

Is it more difficult to do that with this administration than past administrations?

﻿That’s a good question. They are all hard to get beneath the surface of the sort of press-release version of what goes on. At the same time, lots of of people, as you know, feel distress and concern and some of the people were willing to talk out of conscience.

In a review, Isaac Chotiner at Slate asked if you were perhaps the last optimist.

﻿Really? I have not seen this.

He had a lot of criticisms of the book and one of them is there is this sort of view, a bias towards the people who cooperated, and they are presented in an almost heroic way.

But see, he does not know that. No one knows that except for myself and my assistant Evelyn.

Do you think that is true?

I know it is true.

As a reader, there were a lot of moments in the book that it felt rather obvious — when you attributed feelings or thoughts to the person in question. Whether that was Dowd or Gary Cohn or Rob Porter or Reince Priebus or Dave Bossie, where it just seems rather obvious who they are and that they spoke to you.

As you know, people take notes, and as I said in the beginning it either comes from the person himself or herself or it comes from somebody who recorded it right afterwards.

But when it comes to thoughts and feelings, I wonder how you think about how to protect your sources when it comes to that.

Suppose somebody’s [in a] situation and they come out and tell their deputy, “You know what I was thinking or what I thought when that occurred?” It is a common form of expression and if you have got the immediacy and a good source — so much of this is time against the problem. You just have to chip away at it and go back and try to get documents, and it is possible if you have time.

Do you like any of these people? Did you find any of them to be enjoyable human beings?

You mean the sources or the people in the White House?

Anyone in the administration or influencing it from the outside.

It is a good question, but I just go way back — I filter my own emotions out. They intrude so it becomes very — it is like the doctor operating on a patient. Do you like the patient, do you not like the patient? It is irrelevant. It is perhaps a bit cold, but I find that is the best path to find out what happens. If you start saying I like so-and-so or I don’t like so-and-so …

well I think, I hope, it is possible to have an impression of somebody, good or bad.

Right.

And then you filter it out. You filter that out.

You try to just kill it so it doesn’t influence anything.

Yeah.

I wanted to ask you about your relationship with Donald Trump. When did you meet him?

Oh. There was a time in the ’80s when his book came out, The Art of the Deal. My former colleague, Carl Bernstein, called me up and said, “You know, this guy is amazing. We have got to go see him.” And I thought, really? And he said yeah. So, Carl was the driver and we went and interviewed him and there is a tape of it, but we were never able to find it, unfortunately.

Really?

Yeah. It would be an old cassette tape in one of those tape recorders. That’s when I met him and he keeps referring to it in the phone call where he called me last month. He referred to it. When [Robert] Costa and I interviewed him in 2016 when he was on the verge of getting the Republican nomination, he referred to it. I did not take notes. I was a little, kind of — I went along with Carl. Carl has good instincts.

Do you remember much about the conversation or what your impression of him was?

You know, it was Trump being Trump. All confidence and … but you know, I am being candid with you: If somebody told me this man is going to be president of the United States some day, I would have paid more attention.

And over the years, did you interact with him again. Did you maintain a relationship?

I think I went down to Mar-a-Lago once to give a speech. But that was 10, 15 years ago.

What do you think, if anything, people do not understand about this book?

In other words, what is my review …

Review of the reviews.

It’s very interesting.

I’m sorry to get all meta on you.

Oh. Well, you know Hugh Hewitt, you know who he is? A conservative, I did an interview with him and he read the book and he asked questions about Page 248 … and he said that he thinks it is a shame that Trump and people in the White House don’t read it, because he said that he saw some positive things in it. He actually said that he would air-drop copies to all the embassies in Washington so … if they want to see if this is who Trump is. And he said that, oh, it shows no collusion with Russia. Which is true. And I said that I did not find any, but in the end of the book when Dowd is reflecting on the situation, he says, or he concludes, that he and Trump got suckered by Mueller. Turning over all these witness interviews, corroborating documents and so forth, he concludes that Mueller may have something. I don’t know that, but I believe very strongly that the answer to the Russian collusion story is in Russia. Moscow. If somebody who is really going to get to the bottom of the root Russian collusion issue, the answer is in Moscow. If I were to go there, I don’t think I would ever come back.

You think you would be killed?

Yeah. It would be preposterous, given the nature of their regime and how they look at the press and so forth.

It would be preposterous to go there?

Yeah. I think so. Certainly at my age with a family. Maybe if I was 30 and somebody in the CIA was undercover and said, “Come and I can help you.” But that is unlikely, and I am certainly not 30.

Should a younger reporter take the bullet on that one then?

Yeah. What is the Willie Sutton joke about why do you rob banks? Because that is where the money is. Why do you go to the scene, why do you talk to people that were first hand witnesses, why do you try to get documents? Because that where the best version or the best obtainable version of the truth is. In the case of this, I am not going to Moscow.

This book, I noticed, is remarkably bare bones the way you have reported it. Some of your earlier books there is more scene-setting or character-building.

Well, this is a series of scenes.

Yeah, there is kind of a staccato effect to it all. I was wondering if that was intentional or that is just how it turned out.

Well, if you look at the books I have done they tend to be scenes. This happened, then this happened, and so forth. This is very much in that tradition I think.

During an interview — maybe it was with Colbert — you recounted how you showed up at a source’s house and they said, “Are you still doing this shit?”

Yes.

Why are you still doing this shit?

Well, as you know, I have always thought that if somebody came from Mars and spent a year in the United States and then went back and said, who are the people that have the best jobs. [It’s] the reporters. We get to do interesting things, we get to make momentary entries into people’s lives when they are interesting and then get the hell out when they cease to be interesting. Hope Hicks is still interesting, but not as interesting as when she was working in the White House.

Okay, if that’s what you think.

Well, I think because I am interested in what happens, how decisions are made. That doesn’t mean that she would not be a useful path to information now.

It is interesting you phrase it that way. When you look at these people who work there or who have worked there, do you view them as paths to information or do you try to understand them as human beings?

Well, what drives them and so forth obviously is important, but my aim is to find out what happened. That’s what we need. Suppose we knew everything that happened in the Trump White House. Suppose there was a tape recorder and a video of Trump every minute.

He would love that.

Well, it would be illuminating, right? The term Carl Bernstein and I developed a long time ago is “the best obtainable version of the truth.” There has been a lot of reporting on the lies, the things that are untrue. But the question is, what are the consequences of those things that are untrue. How does Trump make decisions? As you go through the book — it is all immense new amounts of detail about North Korea, about Afghanistan, about the Middle East, taxes, immigration, trade issues … that is what affects people.

Do you think there is more emphasis on the why than the how?

No. I think there has been superb reporting, but there is a lot of new material I have about, say, Afghanistan. The meetings and Mattis finally saying to the president, “We need to know if the commander-in-chief is with us. We can can’t fight a half-assed war anymore.” Very illuminating about Trump and Mattis and the process and what was eventually decided to do in Afghanistan.

I am curious if you believe that objectivity is achievable.

Never pure objectivity, of course. But you can improve on it.

Is it desirable to you?

I have said this before as I have done all these interviews — people in our business have become emotionally overwrought by Trump. And I can understand that, but that is not our job. Our job is to figure out what happened, and I think it is very important to be cool about it. That does not mean that you don’t care or you are not engaged. It certainly is not politicized. I have been accused of being on the left or on the right, and somebody actually called me an “ultracentrist.”

Since the election, there seems to be an expectation from the opposition to the president that journalists should do something about the way things turned out. There’s expectation for journalists to be activists. I’m wondering if you feel that as well.

I think that’s not our job. I think there’s been too much — or the appearance of — partisanship. Ken Burns, the documentarian, we talked some time ago, and he said, “You will have written books or done reporting on 20 percent of the presidents that we’ve had.” And that’s a lot of time in history from Nixon to Trump, and there is always a climate of opinion about politics and the press. I’m pretty convinced it’s important to learn to contain yourself emotionally. You asked the question, “Do I like some of the people in the …” I have to say that’s the first time I’ve been asked that question — and I’ve never thought of it. Because I don’t think it’s relevant. And I’m sure if I had a psychiatrist who could … “Do you like so and so or,” we could dig into that. But it’s not … You know obviously I repeat myself on this, I just think that’s … I never thought about it.

What I meant by that was not, like, do you want to hang out with them on the weekend. But more do you think they are decent people?

Decent people. Truth-tellers.

I think if you feel that somebody is a decent person coming from a good place, or at least not coming from a bad place … I mean that has something to do with whether or not you can take them seriously as a source, a credible source. Right?

A series of interesting questions.

I feel as though sometimes I’m checking the account of a White House official who is a known liar against another White House official’s account, and they are also a known liar. And it’s like, well, what do you do?

This is the zoo without walls.

An iconic quote. Right?

Yeah. And that’s a zoo without walls and what does he say — if you have a rat and a mole and a this and a that and so forth.

And a seal …

That’s pretty vividly descriptive and important, and if you’ve got people you can’t trust, then you go elsewhere. But I’m not going to spend a dozen hours or a couple of dozen hours as I did with some people involved without having a trust. And it’s not as you say one White House official who doesn’t tell the truth and another White House official … I think you can penetrate under that for something like a book.

We’ve got internet culture driving impatience — give it to me now. Tell me. You get something and somebody will say, Well, can we get it on the website at noon? And the answer is no. [Laughs.] And so, in writing a book, you have to kind of withdraw from the process of the daily news coverage — which I love and have immense respect, reverence for — in order to keep working the case and the specific scenes and information and finding people and going to see them and staying in their home. It helps to get in their home. People feel more confident in their home. “Do you have any documents?” “No.” “Any notes?” “No.” Well, nobody’s ever worked in the White House that didn’t take something home. And then on the third visit, you say, any documents really, you know, would help. “Well, let me go upstairs and see.” And then coming down, literally, [with] two boxes. And from zero documentation to two boxes. Now those are the moments you feel good about the process — which is a process of delay, patience, and trust, and people know I still work for the Post and they see it doesn’t appear in the paper.

I have a kind of minor logistical question for you. So in your conversation with the president out there, you’re talking about your process by which you request an interview with him. You say you went to Kellyanne [Conway], you went to Raj Shah. You went through Lindsey Graham.

And three other people which we never got to.

I was just curious: Did you try to go through the regular channel of requesting it through Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Not that it’s so easy.

Yeah, I’ve tried even Lindsey Graham, which is the one he acknowledged, though Kellyanne kind of acknowledged.

Kellyanne said she didn’t bring the request directly to him, correct?

Yeah, yeah.

But she’s …

And he said, “You should have told me!” And … then he said, “People are afraid.” That’s the title of the book. [Laughs.]

It could have been called “People Are Afraid.”

Well, it could have been called lots of things. But that’s out of his mouth about …

That interview. One more question …

Sure.

I was curious what you thought of Fire and Fury. You referenced it in the book, but …

Yeah. I think, just a different style and it got some of the sociology right about the relationships but there … the scenes that are with Roger Ailes or with Rupert Murdoch. It’s basically devoid of the decision-making and process matters. And sometimes there’s a process, sometimes there’s not a process, which I try to describe. And I thought that, you know, that was not the focus of his book.

Did you find it to be a credible book?

I mean, as they say, I think it got the sociology largely right. The relationships and so forth. But 50 years from now what’s going to be important about the Trump presidency is what he does or doesn’t do. And if I’m right, as I believe I am, it’s a nervous breakdown.

What does that mean? Do you use that phrase …

Exactly what’s on display there, nervous breakdown. Things are not connected. There is not … there is impulse, decisions. I think that the most ardent Trump supporter could read the book and not feel comfortable about the management and the staying the course. There’s not a team. You know, it’s a team of predators, or people who just disagree with the president.

How did you decide to describe it as a nervous breakdown? I was speaking yesterday to someone who is very close to the president and a strong supporter of his, and they were taking issue with that phrase. And I was curious because it is a divisive way of explaining the book.

I think it’s accurate. And I think it’s demonstrated.

Is that your assessment or did it come from somebody else in your reporting?

No, no, this is kind of what I got. What’s the summary here? Nervous breakdown.

Does that not imply that there was a time when it was not broken down? When the Trump presidency was not in disarray the way it is according to your book?

I’m describing what happened. At first, I think it covers the first 15 months of his presidency. And I think it’s an accurate summary. Time and time again, you know, John Kelly puts out these memos: “We’re going to have a process, no more seat-of-the-pants decisions, everything has to be …” [Laughs.] You’re smiling, because you’ve covered the White House. And that “we will have a formal decision memo, signed on everything,” and then time and time again, the president goes off … calling the steel executives and deciding we’re imposing tariffs. Steel tariffs! Which [to] everyone but Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross … makes no sense.

There were times that I was reading it where I thought that I don’t know if I would necessarily trust the principal who appeared to be telling you something. That was mostly with the campaign stuff — but I’m not going to explain reporting to you.

A number of people have said they’ve heard some of these things off the record. Of course that’s the technique people use: “Oh, that’s off the record, we’re going to seal it away,” and not let the public know. And people would say, I want to say this off the record. I said no. No off the record.

I think reporters have been so liberal in granting anonymity that officials are shocked when you say no. Did you find that?

Yeah. But not shocked — but would then tell anyway.

Yes!

And be background so I could use it.

They don’t put up a fight.

But see then, this isn’t anonymity. This is really the source is confidential but the information and the players are not. So it’s …

Anonymity, even if they’re not removing themselves from the scene …

Well, it’s the wrong word. Because it suggests to people, oh, maybe the reporter doesn’t even know.

Well, people are stupid, though, right?

No, no, I think people are actually smart.

Wow, really?

Yeah!

Interesting.

I think so. And it’s part of the optimism. I need to go, I’m sorry — you’re nice to come by.","albin lohrjonesbloomberg

The simple presence of an illustration is a much-needed reminder to pause, look, think, and look again. I’ve done illustrative coverage of New York Fashion Week since 2012. In that time, I’ve watched technology transform the industry and its media coverage. Designers livestream their shows. Fashion editors post to Instagram directly from their seats. Fashion has accelerated. That said, fashion is an art form. Art deserves time, space, and context to be fully appreciated.

To me, an illustration reveals the essential, the emotional and aesthetic core, and subtracts the extraneous. It captures the mood and highlights the easily overlooked details of color, texture, and silhouette that elevate a truly remarkable piece of clothing. In a sea of runway images and publicity photographs, I think of an illustration as a love letter, an homage, a celebration of a design that goes far beyond “documenting” a look.

Every day of New York Fashion Week, artist Samantha Hahn painted a beautiful moment from the runways. Scroll to see all of her illustrations from the week.

Before anyone knew anything else about him, it was charm that made Jian Ghomeshi a big deal. It began in the mid 2000s, when he hosted a Canadian arts-and-culture radio show, Q. In one episode, the actor Billy Bob Thornton was a guest, and a singularly obnoxious presence; but in the face of his monosyllabic answers and looks of blank hostility, Ghomeshi retained his composure and his warmth. Eventually, the actor accused Canadians of being boring audiences, like “mashed potatoes without the gravy,” and Ghomeshi gently pushed back, replying: “Oh we’ve got some gravy up here.” The YouTube clip, of this good-natured radio host defending his country’s honor against a discourteous megastar, went viral, cementing Ghomeshi’s place as a national icon and skyrocketing Q’s popularity. And so when, five years later, in the course of an onslaught of sexual allegations against him, the public discovered that behind the scenes of their beloved show, Ghomeshi was allegedly telling his producer he wanted to “hate fuck” her and terrorizing his staff, the sense of disjunction was severe. “Captain Canada,” as he sometimes called himself, had turned out to be an alleged monster.

Canadians felt betrayed; Ghomeshi’s whole thing was that he was the nicest guy you knew. And that’s why the rumors about him choking, slapping, and abusing women circulated for so long before gaining real traction. It’s also why his essay in the latest edition of The New York Review of Books is so dangerous. The “nice guy” we once knew is being given the opportunity to repaint himself as just that.

I know what it’s like to fall for his charm. He and I first met in spring 2010, when we began a brief relationship. (I’ve previously written about what it was like to date him.) At first, his behavior seemed romantic. He’d drop by my apartment and surprise me, text me in the morning to tell me that he was thinking of me throughout the show. He took me to concerts and premieres. I was 24 and dating a celebrity 19 years my senior and I was enthralled. Everywhere we went people would come up to talk to him like they knew him. With them, Ghomeshi would be like the guy they heard on the radio show — affable, friendly, familiar. I loved watching the effect he’d have on people just by shaking their hand.

But the longer I was with him, the more he became something else. He would demand that I show him effusive public affection and get sulky if I said I was uncomfortable. He exploded at me if I changed our plans. One night, when we were kissing good-bye in his car, he pushed me up against the window so hard it hurt and wouldn’t let go until I struggled away from his hands.

In what the NYRB has cutely titled “Reflections from a Hashtag,” Ghomeshi reflects on what it’s like to go from being a celebrity to an “outcast.” He describes the depression, self-loathing, and professional consequences he’s experienced since 2014, when multiple women alleged that he’d subjected them to physical and sexual violence. (The case eventually went to trial, where Ghomeshi faced four counts of sexual assault and one count of overcoming resistance by choking, but was ultimately acquitted.) In the four years since the trial concluded, Ghomeshi recounts being abandoned by his closest confidants, contemplating suicide. “There has indeed been enough humiliation for a lifetime,” he writes.

The essay could be considered part of a genre that’s recently emerged, in which men who have been exposed by the #MeToo movement attempt to return to the spotlight by throwing themselves pity parties in the country’s most prestigious publications. On Wednesday, John Hockenberry, another disgraced radio host, published a similar piece in Harper’s titled “Exile.” Hockenberry denies the sexual allegations that were brought against him late last year, and describes the grand injustices that he feels the #MeToo movement has wrought. The question of how “exiled” either of these men really are, considering national magazines are granting them space to tell their story, is certainly worth considering.

In 2014, it took months for reporter Jesse Brown of the Toronto Star to gather all of the horrific, twisted allegations against Jian Ghomeshi. In the end, more than a dozen women came forward with stories of him slapping, choking, punching, and biting them without consent. Two of the women said that before he abused them, he introduced them to a stuffed bear in his bedroom and asked them to turn him around, saying that “Big Ears Teddy shouldn’t see this.” Ghomeshi doesn’t address any of that in his piece. Instead, he qualifies his treatment of women as being “emotionally thoughtless” and admits that he should have “respected” women more. It seems he’d like us to think of him as just your average selfish dude — the kind of guy who might not return a text or a phone call. I wonder what the woman who said he punched her so many times she couldn’t see straight would say to that.

Ghomeshi denies the allegations brought against him. In any case, his essay isn’t really about the the claims, or the women who made them, at all. He spends his pages reflecting on his own pain, without considering the damage he’s done. He’s so self-obsessed, he can’t even bring himself to apologize to the women he’s hurt. “In a maelstrom of confusion, humiliation, resistance, and conflicting feedback from those around you,” he writes, “how much can anyone really inhabit “I’m sorry”? Has he contacted any of the women who he allegedly abused? Has he done any kind of real, measurable work to understand what went wrong? No. This is nothing more than an expression of one man’s ego.

In about 3,400 words, if you care to read them all, Ghomeshi does his best to remind us how likable he is, that underneath all that “sexual assault” nonsense he’s still the charming guy we know and love. Most notably, anecdotes of recent interactions with women bookend the piece. In the opening scene at a karaoke bar, he befriends a woman who’s initially skeptical of him. “Chalk up one more human being who no longer thinks I’m a creep,” he writes, clearly chuffed at his success. The essay concludes with a woman he meets in Paris thanking him for a great conversation. Throughout the piece Ghomeshi cites the “female friends” who’ve stood by him. Look, the ladies love me! he seems desperate to convey.

Eight years ago, the more I got to know Ghomeshi, the more I realized that something didn’t feel right. But I was so caught up in who I thought he was that I didn’t want to let go. There were two Jians — one in public and one in private. I see much of this same behavior in his essay. An attempt to mask what’s beneath; a desire to control the experience of engaging with him. This time, his manipulations exist between the lines. This piece — which, by the way, only exists because he chose to write it — is his chance to tell the story he wants us to believe. It’s his attempt to try to blind us into accepting his version of truth, without acknowledging the depth of the pain he’s caused. But we already know who Jian Ghomeshi is, and it’s not the man portrayed in The New York Review of Books. Make no mistake: This essay is not a reckoning. It’s just another charm offensive.","the

One result of my publishing a book about the real-life case that inspired Lolita, the 1955 novel by Vladimir Nabokov that continues to shock and disturb more than 60 years after its publication, is that people feel compelled to share their opinions about the novel. They tell me they love it, they loathe it, they are disturbed by it, they want to explain it. Those are reactions I expected, and planned for.

More surprising, though, is the number of people — men, usually — who tell me how guilty they feel about reading Lolita, that they once failed to see what it was really about. That they didn’t see Dolores Haze, the 12-year-old girl the novel’s narrator, Humbert Humbert, nicknames “Lolita”, as a victim but instead as a seductress. That they failed to see how the real-life case, the 1948 kidnapping of 11-year-old Sally Horner, was directly referenced in the text, and a key influence for Nabokov.

Those men are far from alone. Humbert Humbert is one of the most notoriously unreliable narrators in literature. His description of his monstrous obsession with pre-pubescent girls, whom he characterizes as “nymphets”, is to fool the reader into going along with his criminally skewed worldview. Nabokov’s dazzling, inventive language overrides the ugly truth that Humbert is a pedophile who rapes 12-year-old Dolores Haze repeatedly over a nearly two-year cross-country odyssey. It is all too easy to take Humbert at his narrative word that young Dolores initiated their sexual relationship, that her wish to lose her virginity justified his illicit (and illegal) desires. There is no reason to trust him. But the last 60 years have shown that millions of readers of all stripes and designations do trust Humbert, and buy into the notion that Lolita is a universal love story.

Which is why it was particularly baffling for me to read John Hockenberry’s Harper’s essay. Hockenberry, the longtime host of PRI’s The Takeaway, did not have his contract renewed in 2017 after multiple co-workers and contributors came forward with stories of sexual harassment and workplace abuse. Hockenberry’s dismissal from PRI happened during the first wave of #MeToo reckonings that followed the Harvey Weinstein revelations. His public return, through the highly prestigious platform offered by Harper’s, occurred as his sexual misconduct brethren attempted comebacks of their own — including the surprise stand-up set by the comedian Louis C.K. and the Canadian musician and radio host Jian Ghomeshi’s own self-serving apologia in the New York Review of Books.

That Hockenberry waited barely a year to write his essay is in keeping with the consensus impatience of these so-called canceled men and their collective inability to admit, let alone comprehend, how their behavior harmed women. But Hockenberry wasn’t satisfied to follow the usual narcissistic playbook. He had to bring Lolita into it.

The novel was part of Hockenberry’s “small personal canon of works and experiences that I have had to or chosen to reexamine.” With respect to Lolita, at least, his initial and concluding judgments betray skewed thinking. Saying that he “became completely certain that Nabokov would have been arrested if it were published today” misses the point, because Lolita is so wholly rooted in post-World War II America, with its narrative set between 1947 and 1952, that it could not exist as a contemporary novel. Those who have tried to update Lolita, like John Colapinto with Undone, found an audience indifferent at best, with sales to match.

The most galling part of Hockenberry’s re-examination of Lolita is his ultimate conclusion: that he found himself “identifying with Lolita, her innocence lost along with any identity other than sexual” because he, like Dolores Haze, had “nowhere to go.” That a man fired for repeated sexual harassment, one who could hardly wait before jumping back into the public fray, aligns himself with the victim of repeated horror demonstrates a stunning lack of understanding — and shame. Whatever Hockenberry lost paled in comparison to the losses of the women he harassed and humiliated. Whatever humiliations he felt don’t deserve to be discussed in the same sentence as rape.

I would imagine, too, that Hockenberry’s identification would mortify the Nabokovs. As Vladimir’s wife, Véra, wrote in a diary note days after the American publication of Lolita in 1958, “I wish, though, somebody would notice the tender description of the child’s helplessness, her pathetic dependence on monstrous HH, and her heartrending courage all along.”

Sixty years later, more people are noticing what Véra hoped for. But the flip side is that more people, particularly men, are clinging to Lolita to absolve their own terrible behavior. Dolores Haze is not a therapy animal. Feeling guilty about the trauma of girls and women doesn’t absolve you of your own bad deeds and thoughts.

And as more #MeTooed men step forward to reclaim what they felt they were always entitled to, let’s keep the focus on those they harmed, who always mattered more — and always will.

The Duluth, Minnesota, indie rockers Low have been crafting delicate, icy, minimalist guitar music for 25 years. They weren’t the first on the scene in the early ’90s “slowcore” boom, where bands like Codeine, Ida, and the Red House Painters whittled arrangements down and decelerated rock’s hard charging pace to a crawl, but they have outlasted most of their peers thanks to the bond shared by co-founders Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker, childhood friends, spouses, and parents to two teenagers. Low perseveres because Alan and Mimi aren’t afraid to torch the formula and draft a new one. 2001’s Things We Lost in the Fire worked hard to sweeten the chilly austerity they’d built up over early albums like Long Division and I Could Live in Hope; 2005’s divisive The Great Destroyer ramped up the volume and tempo, at the cost of coming out alarmingly conventional. 2015’s Ones and Sixes came to life at Bon Iver mastermind Justin Vernon’s hometown April Base Studio in Wisconsin with 22, A Million collaborator BJ Burton as producer. Sixes flipped the script again, adding tasteful synth textures to the three-piece’s gossamer mix without upsetting the balance. Low’s puckish early objective was confronting midwestern grunge audiences with the sound of silence, and they continue to find new ways to challenge and confound their base.

This week’s Double Negative, another Burton collaboration crafted at April Base, is a new metamorphosis. The electronic accents of Ones and Sixes are the main pulse now; the conversion from pleasing, patient guitar, bass, and drum songs to the ambient drones and forbidding borderline noise is a shock on par with the Japanese director Shinya Tsukamoto’s seminal body horror film Tetsuo: The Iron Man, where a man commits a crime and wakes up to discover his body slowly turning into metal. Double Negative is also a commentary on human cruelty and terror; asked what the title refers to in a recent interview with The Wire, Sparhawk said, “There are negative things going on, and we’re reacting negatively.” The new songs came together after the 2016 election, but the album differs from others this year that seem bruised by sociopolitical strife in that it isn’t just an emotional response to the spiritual bummer accompanying our rapid descent into cultural warfare. It’s also a provocation for the parties responsible. Opener “Quorum” is a cry for justice: “You’ve torn vacant stares / You tried to break the quorum.” “A quorum is the minimum amount of a group of people that needs to be there to make a decision for that decision to be valid,” Sparhawk explained to The Wire. The president lost the popular vote by 3 million ballots.

In its long stretches of peaceful, eddying drones, Double Negative also resembles New York composer William Basinski’s Disintegration Loops, another artifact of American decay. Basinski famously finished the project, which documents the sound of 20-year-old tape recordings crumbling, on the morning of 9/11. Both records’ crash into sad, gorgeous rot brush against the pulse of the times. But where 2001 fell from bullish comfort to paranoiac warmongering, 2018 has seen America gnawing away at itself, so Low’s vision is decidedly more disquieting. For every moment of calm — see: the chant that closes “Dancing and Blood” or the lengthy drone that consumes “Always Up” two-thirds in — there’s something terrifying lying in wait. The thicket of static and howling voices comprising the meat of “The Son, the Sun” must be what Dante Alighieri heard when he imagined Hell. “Quorum” traps a beautiful melody behind a wall of clattering noise in the same way that Ben Frost records whittle pretty sounds down to jagged things, like shivs.

Double Negative recasts Sparhawk and Parker’s light, ephemeral approach to melody as something hard and steely. Album highlight “Tempest” has a vocal that is both pleading and nearly unintelligible, like someone using April Base’s trademark robot harmony tech without laying clean vocals on top. Mimi’s voice sputters through “Dancing and Blood” like a flickering hologram. Bassist Steve Garrington is actually the MVP of this album; his role as arbiter of the band’s keyboards and low end is crucial to the guttural reaches of the new songs. A few of the eerie, sustained vocal melodies throughout Double Negative are actually samples of Sparhawk and Parker’s voices, meaning there’s electronics at play even in the human elements of the album. What’s astounding about the radical changes in gear and method is that, beneath the static, Low still sounds like Low. Melodies still bob and drift like fish lounging in a tank. Alan’s and Mimi’s voices still seem made expressly for each other, even processed to a point of technological singularity. The notes everyone plays and sings still root themselves in Western rock and folk traditions.

There’s a cinematic feel to Double Negative’s unsettling machine blues. The balance of serenity and calamity here plays a kindred spirit to Alfonso Cuarón’s white knuckle sci-fi thriller Gravity (and Steven Price’s Academy Award–winning score), where Sandra Bullock plays an astronaut whose failed mission to repair the Hubble telescope destroys her ship and leaves her floating in space and, eventually, hurtling back to Earth. Double Negative is front-loaded with all of the most alien, forbidding sounds; the album is sequenced as a slow drift from parts unknown back to familiar territory. The late album gems “Dancing and Fire,” “Poor Sucker,” and “Rome (Always in the Dark)” could reasonably fit on any of the last three Low albums, but here, situated at the end of a dizzying program of augmented voices and whirring noises, they feel like the grizzled perseverance at the bottom of a moment of distress. “Before it falls into total disarray,” Sparhawk sings on the closer, “you’ll have to learn to live a different way.” It’s the closest thing to a pop song the album is willing to muster, a hopeful, ascending melody assembled out of squelching, flatulent noises that seems to say, in its lyrics and composition, that unpleasantness is best used as kindling, as fuel to get to a better place.","bon iver mastermind justin

Perhaps you were already under the assumption that the deepest love you’ve ever felt was the love you felt in high school: be it for your first boyfriend or girlfriend, or for someone in *NSYNC. It is true that teenagers feel their feelings with deranged intensity, which is the only explanation for the time I gave a crush my phone number by creating a secret program in his TI-83 graphing calculator. Never again (hopefully) will you feel that you will die if you don’t spend every waking second talking to or at least looking at the object of your desire.

Still, a recent Reddit r/relationships thread presented the world’s lovelorn teens with a challenge: If the human brain doesn’t finish developing until one’s mid-20s, is it really possible for anyone younger to truly comprehend the meaning of love?

The question was posed by a 23-year-old woman whose 23-year-old boyfriend of more than a year (“Andy”) told her it’s “too soon” to know if he loves her because of their undeveloped brains. I agree that his brain is underdeveloped, but the commenters were polarized. User princessmorbux took the boyfriend’s side, writing: “I’m not going to lie, my concept of love was completely different at 23 than 29. He’s not entirely wrong.” User ConsistentCheesecake, however, was not having it: “Wow your boyfriend sounds like a pretentious, insufferable person. Over a year and he can’t say he loves you? DEAL BREAKER. Plus his argument is insanely stupid anyway.”

So who’s right? According to Dean Burnett, a neuroscientist and author of the international best sellers Idiot Brain and Happy Brain, it’s the girlfriend, along with princessmorbux et al. (Duh.) Burnett points out that while it’s true that the brain continues to develop well into our 20s, that doesn’t mean it can’t do anything properly before that point: “When we hit our teens, our brains are still developing, but they’re not necessarily acquiring new abilities or information. Instead, they’re sorting out what they’ve already accumulated, and making things more efficient,” he writes. By one’s late teens (and certainly by the age of 23, ANDY), the brain is maturing and learning to make important connections.

Furthermore, what needs the most development in one’s teens and 20s aren’t the basic, instinctive processes like fear, affection, and love, but more complex, prefrontal-cortex-based functions. What makes our teen years (and early 20s) so emotionally overwhelming, says Burnett, is actually the fact that we can feel all those superintense feelings, but don’t yet have all the rational thought processes in place to control them.

This may seem like bad news for the original poster, but it only feels that way now. In an update to her post, she informed the Reddit community that she and Andy broke up mere days later, during a discussion in which he had the unbelievable nerve to pull the “I love you, but I’m not in love with you” card.

In these fetid times, it’s easy to know what you’re against. And I’ve spent many diaries assailing the dueling Trump and “social justice” cults on the illiberal right and left these past several months. But what am I for?

That’s a harder question but a useful one to ask yourself from time to time. You don’t defeat something with nothing. So I thought I’d take a brief detour from the tribal abyss, and go back to some first principles. I remain a conservative, pretty much where I’ve always been, with the exception of foreign policy where I’ve seen the folly of interventionism in the wake of Iraq. By conservative, I do not mean Republican. To my mind, the Republican Party has become — and not just recently — a cancer on this particular strain of Western thought. To those who believe that this is a cop-out, or a version of the “all true conservatives” gambit, I offer a new book, which sure buoyed my spirits, and helped me regain my bearings. Reading it, for me, was like feeling an unexpectedly cool, dry breeze on a stiflingly humid day.

The book is called Conservatism: An Introduction to the Great Tradition, and it’s by arguably the most acute conservative thinker of his generation, Roger Scruton. It’s a slim, concise monograph, and it begins with the truth that conservatism is a branch of liberalism, and not its enemy. It is the branch that tries to conserve the liberal democratic state against the corrosive effects and flaws of liberalism itself (not to speak of leftism and reactionism, which seek to overthrow liberalism entirely). More to the point, it does not defend liberalism as a function of natural rights, or of human rights, or self-evident truths, but simply as the inheritance of a particular place in a particular sliver of human history: the Anglo-American world in the last two and a half centuries.

Conservatism defends the individual against the state as an evolving tradition born in the English common law from the 12th century onward, a tradition that came to be embedded in the American justice system. What distinguished the American Revolution, conservatives argue, was that it was rooted in a defense of the rights of Englishmen against a monarch’s whims, as much as a novus ordo seclorum. It was not only a liberal revolution, but also a conservative one, seeking to defend a preexisting state of affairs, and buttressing a new egalitarianism with deep conservative safeguards against majoritarianism, mob rule, and direct democracy. The alternative type of revolution — the one that took place in France — was based on a complete erasure of what had gone before, a rupture in time and culture and regime, and one that led, as all such ruptures must, to murderous tyranny. When all tradition and inherited institutions and norms are abolished, there is only raw power to occupy the vacuum.

Conservatism began then as a defense of America and a critique of France — which is the essence of Edmund Burke’s formative argument. He saw the advent of democracy as a challenge — which demanded acute attention as hierarchies collapsed, and society changed, in order to ensure that too much of value wasn’t thrown away. And so it emphasized the importance of a vibrant and autonomous civil society (independent of government), the centrality of federalism, local community, and voluntary association of the kind that Tocqueville marveled at and saw as the indispensable complement to the atomizing, destabilizing forces that America had also unleashed.

Conservatism’s defense of the free market and free trade was therefore never absolute. In fact, there’s more protectionism in conservatism’s past than many would like to admit. But these market mechanisms were nonetheless the least worst way to discern the value of things traded and sold, and were never supposed to be ends in themselves or to be advanced regardless of the impact on society. In fact, for conservatism, society is for no end and no purpose; it is valuable simply in itself, as the combination of traditions, landscapes, communities, and customs that define a nation, bind us together as citizens, and make us feel at home.

And yes, that feeling of being at home is nebulous. It is in many ways sub-rational. Ask ordinary people to describe it and they will often not be articulate. Sometimes, it manifests itself as bigotry, yes. Most of the time, it is about loss, and mourning it, while understanding that change is inevitable. Burke famously saw society not as a contract between individuals, but as a contract between generations: to pass on to the future the good and viable things we inherited from the past. This emphatically does not mean resistance to all change. In fact, it understands some change as critical to conservation. And perhaps that’s where American conservatism began to go wrong. The goal is not to stand athwart history and cry “Stop!”, as William F. Buckley put it. It’s to be part of the stream of history and say: slow it down a bit, will you?

In Scruton’s account, the list of conservative intellectuals is long and distinguished. The respective geniuses of Burke and Hume and Hegel are integral to its formation; they were succeeded by the Romantic era that urged a corrective to mass industrialization, and a hedge to the Enlightenment’s preference for theoretical reason over the practical wisdom that works, as Adam Smith saw it, as an invisible hand in guiding society. Tradition, conservatives believe, is a form of collective knowledge. It can contain wisdom that reason simply cannot grasp.

As a temperament, conservatives are prone to obey as passionately as liberals are prone to rebel. They prefer order to change, stability to upheaval, authority to anarchy. And so a conservative is likely to see, say, the flag as an object of veneration, the Constitution as something to be protected rather than altered, the nation as demanding a loyalty before all other claims, especially those of ideology, tribe, gender, or race. The conservative immediately saw why Fascism and Communism were evil; they were intent on obliterating settled ways of life, destroying the individual in favor of a collective, empowering the state so that it destroyed the civil society that made liberalism thrive. No conservative ever wants to purify anything. It’s the human mess that we love, with its intimations of how to improve it.

And so conservatism became the resistance to socialism, to government planning, and to the abuse of the English language so that it could be forced to reflect an ideology, rather than a lived reality. (In this sense, Scruton shrewdly notes, Orwell was a conservative.) It saw all too well how the good intentions of liberalism could lead to its unraveling. It abhors war as the ultimate change-maker and disrupter; it despises concepts of race or gender that eradicate the uniqueness of the individual; it defends high culture against philistinism and mediocrity; it cherishes norms. It values the particular over the general, prefers present laughter to utopian bliss, relishes humor in all its forms, defends art as an apolitical force, and respects religion as a separate avenue for the search for ultimate truth, and a critical component of the civil and moral society that enables government to be small and limited.

In today’s America, this conservatism is completely under siege. The left will increasingly tolerate nothing that gets in the way of what it calls “social justice,” which far too often reduces individuals to their racial or class or gender identities rather than their merits, or character, or talents. The conservative approach to a multicultural and multiracial society is to keep our focus on the individual and do what’s best to help every individual, regardless of their race, gender, or whatever, to be part of our shared liberal democratic inheritance. Conservatism is about enfolding the new into the old, sustaining a society’s coherence and cohesion, while being extremely tough on particular injustices against particular individuals, vigilant about corruption, and anguished when the criminal justice system loses legitimacy, because of embedded racism.

But conservatism is more deeply besieged by the Republican Party, its alleged harbor. If you consider the themes I’ve emphasized above, it becomes clearer that the GOP is not only not conservative, but actually dedicated to destroying that tradition. Republicans pursue the ideology of free markets and lower and lower taxation, regardless of its brutal assault on fiscal solvency, human dignity, social cohesion, and community life. They have nominated and protected a president who assaults the norms that conservatives revere, has contempt for existing institutions and sees the rule of law as a means to advance his own interests, rather than that of the society as a whole.

This is a man and a party that has such disdain for conserving anything that it is actively despoiling our landscape, enabling a climate catastrophe. It is a party that has generated crippling and everlasting debt — even in good economic times — in a way that makes a mockery of any compact between generations. It is a party that actively endorses cruelty as a policy tool, deploys fear as its prime political weapon, and insists that the opposite party has no legitimate right to govern at all. It is the party of torture, the absolute nemesis of the liberal inheritance, the party of corruption, propaganda, vote suppression, and barely masked bigotry.

I despise it because I am a conservative. I don’t believe that conservatism can be revived on the right (it has been thankfully sustained, by default, by the Democrats in recent decades) until this hateful philistine would-be despot and his know-nothing cult is gone. And by revived, I do not mean a return to neoconservatism abroad or supply side crack-pottery at home. The 1980s and 1990s are over. I mean a conservatism that can tackle soaring social and economic inequality as a way to save capitalism, restore the financial sector as an aid to free markets and not their corrupting parasite, a conservatism that will end our unending wars, rid the criminal justice system of its racial blind spots, defend liberal education and high culture against the barbarians of postmodernism and the well-intentioned toxins of affirmative action, pay down the debt, reform the corruption of religious faith, protect our physical landscape, invest in non-carbon energy, and begin at the local level to rebuild community and the spirit of American civil association.

I also believe we need to slow the pace of demographic and cultural change. It is happening too fast, even for America, to sustain our society’s coherence and cohesion. The elite indifference to mass immigration — especially the illegal kind — is an ugly pact between Republican elites, eager for cheap, exploitable labor, and Democratic elites, who cynically encourage it because they think it will give them a reliable voting bloc. When the foreign-born population is at a proportion last seen in 1910, and as the raw numbers are higher than ever before, it is not inherently racist to seek to slow the pace to integrate the newcomers better, to defuse racial conflict and resentment. A nation has to mean something; to survive, it needs a conservative weaving of past, present, and future, as Burke saw it. And you cannot do that if you see this country as a blight on the face of the earth and an instrument of eternal oppression; or if you replace a healthy, self-critical patriotism with an ugly, racist nationalism that aims to restore the very worst of this country’s past, rather than preserve its extraordinary and near-unique achievements.

I know there’s no place for this in our current political climate. And that is why I believe this country is in as grave a crisis as any since the 1850s. Without a healthy conservatism, liberalism will degenerate. Without liberalism, conservatism has no inheritance to defend. And both rich veins in Western moderation are now under assault from the ideological left and the authoritarian right. We have to brave this pincer attack, conservatives and liberals together, or we will die together.

Curbing Europe’s Far-Right Resurgence

So the Swedish center has survived. My fear that the far right would make huge gains in the recent election was not borne out, thank the Lord. They merely made impressive gains. Ross Douthat had a shrewd column this week, weighing the possibilities of both a far-right-wing wave in Europe, or enough resistance to it to create an enduring political stalemate. I’m obviously not clairvoyant, but I suspect that stalemates, rather than shoring up an existing order, can often lead to a radical move, on the left or right, to end them.

On that front, the great centrist hope of the E.U., Emmanuel Macron, is now polling at 31 percent approval; E.U. sanctions against Hungary as a response to Viktor Orban’s authoritarianism are set to be vetoed … by the Polish authoritarians, kicking the liberal democratic foundations of the E.U. out from under it. Hitler salutes were frequent during far-right marches in Germany at the end of last month, as mobs chanted menacing slogans we thought we’d never hear in Germany again. Merkel herself has ceded the immigration issue to the right of her coalition, and long ago opined that: “the approach [to build] a multicultural [society] and to live side-by-side and to enjoy each other … has failed, utterly failed.” In the fall, as my colleague Heather Hurlburt has noted, Bavaria will vote, almost certainly pushing the CSU, Merkel’s sister party, to adopt much of the AfD’s message. And in Sweden, the reason that the Swedish Democrats didn’t do as well as they hoped was because every other party had begun to echo their concerns and adopt their rhetoric. Per National Review’s Douglas Murray:

Consider the final leaders debate before Sunday’s election in Sweden. At one point in the debate the head of the Moderate party (the Moderate party) attacked the prime minister over integration and its purported ‘successes.’ Which successes was he thinking of, asked the head of the Moderate party? What was the prime minister happiest with? “The shootings? The unemployment?” He went on to list all the negative consequences of mass immigration that his country is experiencing.

In Italy, we have a new government intent on forcible mass deportation and hostile to the E.U. If you want to see how this dynamic has played out in Poland itself since the end of the Cold War, I can’t recommend this essay by Anne Applebaum enough. Britain, meanwhile, the European country where liberal democracy and a moderate conservatism have the deepest roots, is careening toward a constitutional crisis. Right now, there is no majority in the House of Commons for Theresa May’s soft Brexit; and there is no majority for a no-deal hard Brexit. There isn’t, in fact, a majority for any outcome to the Brexit drama. Current polling suggests that even if the government fell and there was another election, the result could be the same. All this is happening as the clock ticks toward 11 p.m. on March 29, 2019, when the transition period under Article 50 expires, as the Labour Party turns into a radical socialist party, and as the Tories embark on a massive internal civil war. No one knows what will happen.

The former Tory Party leader and foreign secretary William Hague — a deeply sane man — recently argued that “complete with an atmosphere of intense recrimination and abuse, it would be no exaggeration to say that this would be the most serious constitutional crisis in Britain for at least one century, and possibly two.”

The well-intentioned fantasies that all of Europe could have one currency, that the rise of liberal democracy was unstoppable, and that mass immigration, with precious little integration, was an unalloyed good, have come crashing down to earth. As the pressure of mass migration from the South continues, if only because of the demographic explosion in Africa and the Middle East, we may end up with rabidly anti-immigrant parties dominating the entire European landscape. Sweden was a breathing space, opening the possibility that moderate liberal and conservative parties can co-opt the far-right resurgence and tame it. But the oxygen levels behind liberal democracy still keep falling across the continent.

The Left’s Dangerous Trumpian Tactics

The clinically delusional narcissist who now occupies the White House really went there yesterday. The idea that an estimated 2,975 Americans did not die as a consequence of Hurricane Maria is an affront to the living, the dead, and statistics. We have two solid, separate studies reaching a very similar conclusion. Of course, Trump isn’t entirely at fault for a hurricane. But he was the president. And the follow-through was terrible. Daniel Dale notes his multiple delusions on this matter before, which defy, well, reality. This is 25th Amendment territory: the self-delusion is so great it qualifies as a form of mental illness. No one who cannot distinguish between fantasy and reality should be president of the United States.

And these lies have prompted an understandable but dangerous echo on the other side. It’s nowhere near as insane, but it seems to me that lies of a different sort, and personal demonization of your opponents, is beginning to creep into the resistance. I would vote against the Brett Kavanaugh nomination if I were a senator, because of the real possibility that Kavanaugh would protect an authoritarian president from the rule of law in our looming constitutional crisis. But it is not true that he “said” that it was his view that contraception involves abortion-inducing drugs. He was clearly referring to others’ views on the subject, which is why Kamala Harris selectively edited a clip in order to distort his words. No fact-checker can defend it. But in an act of glorious self-parody, Hillary Clinton reiterated it two days after the lie was debunked.

ThinkProgress, meanwhile, has refused to acknowledge that its headline — “Brett Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade last week and almost no one noticed” — was also false. The piece was a perfectly defensible airing of the real possibility that Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe, but the headline said something else. When The Weekly Standard notified Facebook of the lie, the piece was rightly defined as false, which prompted a huge swath of left-liberal media to … demand The Weekly Standard be stripped of its Facebook role in policing untruth.

Trump’s airing of unsubstantiated rumors was similarly echoed by Senators Harris and Feinstein, who gave the impression of having some dubious ethical and criminal concerns about Kavanaugh, but refused to substantiate them on the record. Feinstein’s last-minute claim that she knows something about Kavanaugh that she referred to the FBI has not been verified, but she aired it anyway. It is, in other words, a McCarthyite smear. Here’s how ThinkProgress reported it: “Brett Kavanaugh may have committed a very serious crime —possibly even a sex crime. Or maybe he didn’t.”

Seriously, guys? The NYT reported that “two officials familiar with the matter say the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Judge Kavanaugh and a woman when they were both in high school.” Later, The Guardian suggested that this was the crime: “According to the source, Kavanaugh and a male friend had locked [a 17-year old woman] in a room against her will, making her feel threatened, but she was able to get out of the room.” Friday morning, the New Yorker reported that this was the alleged incident: “In the letter, the woman alleged that, during an encounter at a party, Kavanaugh held her down, and that he attempted to force himself on her. She claimed in the letter that Kavanaugh and a classmate of his, both of whom had been drinking, turned up music that was playing in the room to conceal the sound of her protests, and that Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand. She was able to free herself.” I can’t verify any of this, but if Feinstein had a letter about this incident before the hearings, as reported by the New Yorker, she could have brought it up before now, she could have briefed her Senate colleagues, or she could have forwarded it to the FBI without publicizing it. Throwing it out there at the last minute is beyond lame.

Look: There is no comparison between the lies and smears and personal demonization among leftists and liberals, and the staggering dishonesty and indecency of this president. I’m not what-about-ing or both-sides-ing here. But Trump can corrupt more than just the government. He can corrupt his opposition, who are forced to deal with him on this polarized turf, and can resort to tactics that take us deeper into the post-truth maze. We will not defeat Trump by imitating Trump. In fact, we run the risk of legitimizing the forces that have empowered him.

Netflix’s Norm Macdonald Has a Show is a talk show designed to make one person comfortable, and to make one person laugh. That second part is not a huge problem: Norm Macdonald’s sense of humor is not for everyone, but there are viewers who will enjoy his long memory for the history of comedy and his interest in Old Hollywood stories. They’ll also enjoy his taste for under-delivery, self-deprecation, and his jokes about hookers, trying to hit on women, and all the coke everyone did back in the day.

But the sense that the entire series is built to feed the needs and reinforce the perspective of a single person, well, that’s more frustrating. Norm Macdonald Has a Show could have been designed as a platform for his guests. It could have been oriented more toward the show’s audience — who, one would imagine, are people who are not Norm Macdonald. Instead, the whole thing feels like it could just as easily have taken place without cameras in Macdonald’s basement. It also seems like Macdonald might find that arrangement pretty satisfying.

The show isn’t served well by its shaggy first episode, featuring guest David Spade. Macdonald and Spade wander onto the small set in a daze, and Spade keeps asking how things are supposed to work. Will Macdonald introduce him? Are there commercial breaks? What’s the format of this thing? Who’s supposed to be the audience? Macdonald just shrugs and rolls ahead, taking obvious pleasure in his guest’s minor discomfort. At one point, while Spade believes they’re taking a break and camera equipment rolls by in front of the interview desk, Spade cracks that the set’s still being built while they’re shooting it. It’s meant as a joke, but it’d be funnier if it felt less true. It’s not the incomplete set that’s the larger problem, though. It’s the general sense that no one prepared all that much, and that it doesn’t matter because they’re just figuring it out as they go.

Norm Macdonald Has a Show is a part of a genre that once felt subversive and fresh. Macdonald’s interview style is aiming for raw conversations, with the intended goal of just being honest and authentic, man. It’s about just sittin’ around, tellin’ stories, havin’ a great time, shootin’ the shit. But where this might once have seemed like daring response to overly stuffy, overly scripted interview programs, Macdonald’s show is now just one in a vast supply of #authentic #content, many of them already focused on showcasing comedians. To be fair, most of those shows are podcasts rather than talk shows, and in that way, Norm Macdonald Has a Show isn’t that far from WTF With Marc Maron or You Made It Weird or (shudders) The Joe Rogan Experience. The difference is that in the best of those shows, the interviewer seems to have prepared. Or at least given thought to the way they want the arc of the conversation to run.

It’s not that Macdonald is actually under-prepared about the work and lives of his guests. He’s eminently knowledgeable, especially about obscure comedy personalities and classic films. It’s more that his entire style is to downplay that intelligence, which then either makes his guests feel uncomfortable, or implies that all the responsibility for the way the show runs belongs to the guest. At one point, Jane Fonda chides Macdonald. “I know you’ve done enough research to know [better],” she tells him, after he makes an intentional mistake about the role of a love interest in one of Fonda’s films. “I need no research to talk to you,” Macdonald responds, “because I’ve grown up with you. I’ve Jazzercised.” “That’s not what I did,” Fonda replies, referring to her workout videos, which were called Jane Fonda’s Workout. “Oh yeah, I know,” Macdonald says, “but they later called it ‘Jazzercise.’ They stole your idea.” Fonda nods, still slightly confused about what this conversation is about. It’s hard to blame her.

For fans of Macdonald’s comedy, this will feel right in his wheelhouse. But it’s hard to get away from the sense that Macdonald doesn’t particularly care, and that he is its only intended audience. He may be cracking a joke about how he’s “grown up” with Fonda and that should be enough, but the fundamental idea is still that his own interests and worldview are the only things on display.

Occasionally, Macdonald’s interests make space for the interests of his guests. Sometimes his guests are allowed to tell full stories. But even when Macdonald is intentionally deferential or flattering, there’s a sense that he has very little interest in what he might derisively refer to as “political correctness” and I would think of as “considering women to be something other than sexual objects.” He asks if Spade has ever paid for “straight sex,” which Spade pauses before answering, “Indirectly … there’s a lot of hybrid hookers out there.” “What do you mean?” Macdonald responds, gamely. “I mean, you go out on a date, you fool around a little bit, and a few days later it’s like, Hey, I need a new radiator,” Spade says. Macdonald laughs heartily.

In the two episodes provided to critics where the show’s guest is a woman, Macdonald leads with commentary that feels tilted toward their gender. His first question for Jane Fonda is, “Who do you consider sexy?” He tells Drew Barrymore how overwhelming he finds her “radiance,” something he first noticed when he saw her at a Souplantation years ago. But it doesn’t matter if you’re on a talk show or a city street: Beginning a conversation with a woman by saying that you saw her at a salad bar and found her “magnetic and radiant” will never be anything but off-putting.

I’m not suggesting that Norm Macdonald should not be allowed to have interesting conversations with people he finds appealing. Of course he should do that: When he gives them room to do so, the stories he gets his guests to tell are fascinating, especially when they’re digging up old, untold stories about the entertainment industry. I just wish the cultural sense that women were more than sexual objects didn’t have to get dug up along the anecdotes. It makes Macdonald feel like a man out of his time, like a talk-show host who belongs to an older era, a time when one straight white male boomer’s amusement was enough to render something compelling.","photo eddy chen netflix

Thom Tillis. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo Kavanaugh Confirmation GOP not fazed by anonymous allegation against Kavanaugh Senate Republicans see no reason not to move forward.

Senate Republicans are shrugging off a newly raised, anonymous allegation of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, pledging on Sunday to move forward with President Donald Trump’s pick.

The allegation of Kavanaugh’s conduct in high school, raised in a letter given to top Judiciary Committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California, is too little and far too late, said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). The Senate Judiciary Committee member said he is a “little bit offended” by the letter’s claims coming out so late in the process, said “there’s nothing we can do” about it, and predicted Kavanaugh will win narrow confirmation.

Story Continued Below

“They’ve had this stuff for three months; if they were serious about it, they should have told us about it,” Kennedy said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I think every Republican will vote for Judge Kavanaugh. I think at least two, and maybe more, Democrats will” vote for him.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), another Judiciary Committee member, said he was “shocked” that the information did not come out during Kavanaugh’s recent confirmation hearings.

“We have a confidential witness not willing to sit down at least in a closed setting; that's problematic to me. And … Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations, and I put some weight on that,” Tillis said on “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “We'll move forward to report him out of the committee and confirm him before October.”

Kavanaugh, however, is still short of the votes needed to be confirmed on the Senate floor. The high court pick needs 50 votes to be approved, meaning GOP leaders are relying on one of two centrist GOP senators to break the logjam: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Susan Collins of Maine.

Murkowski and Collins have not signaled how they will vote, though Republican leadership was confident that the duo would support Kavanaugh before the allegations were raised in the past week. Collins spoke to Kavanaugh for an hour on Friday, but it’s not clear whether the letter came up in the conversation.

No Democrats have announced their support for Kavanaugh; most of the 49-member Democratic Caucus is opposed. The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination on Thursday.

The letter describes Kavanaugh and another male teenager entering a room with a female teenager in high school, according to two people familiar with the letter. The New Yorker reported that Kavanaugh tried to force himself on the female. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.

Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), who has not met with Kavanaugh, plans to bring up the claims if he is able to sit down with the nominee this week and said his Democratic colleagues should have brought up the matter earlier in the confirmation process, at least in private meetings. But he also said he believes “you are going to see this nomination move forward.”

“It’s a very serious allegation. But at this point, it’s an anonymous letter; you’re not going to be able to really test it unless somebody comes forward with more information,” Jones said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I wish someone had talked about it early on … at this late date, we’re going to have to wait and see if this person comes forward.”

Jones is among a small group of undecided Democrats, a list that also includes Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana.

Donnelly, Heitkamp and Manchin voted for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch last year.

Few Senate Democrats have commented on the allegation, and “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace said all 10 Judiciary Committee Democrats declined his request to appear on his show.

In the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, Feinstein said she will vote against Kavanaugh and made a passing reference to the new allegations.

“Supreme Court justices should not be an extension of the Republican Party. They must also have unquestionable character and integrity, and serious questions remain about Judge Kavanaugh in this regard, as indicated in information I referred to the FBI,” Feinstein wrote.

Senators will all have access to the letter now that it has been added to background files.

Liberal groups have called for Kavanaugh’s nomination to be withdrawn after the decades-old charges were aired. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a high-profile progressive expected to win a New York House seat this fall, raised the prospect that more victims may now come forward.

“He should certainly not be confirmed before this is explored,” she said on CNN. “If her account is true, there could potentially be other victims out there that are scared to come forward, and this could potentially be an act of solidarity for them to air that out if they exist.""

But Republicans have shown no indications they will hit pause, and they are unlikely to do so unless Collins, Murkowksi or another Republican raises a red flag, according to a person working on the nomination. The committee vote Thursday is expected to be party line, with Republicans narrowly controlling the Senate and the committee. The 51-seat GOP majority can afford one defection on the Senate floor if no Democrats support Kavanaugh.

And though Democrats have tried to slow the nomination over hundreds of thousands of missing documents and what they say is a rushed process, there’s no indication yet that the Kavanaugh letter will hinder his path to the Supreme Court.","thom tillis jacquelyn martinap photo kavanaugh

Sen. John Kennedy on Sunday predicted that a Judiciary Committee vote to advance Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh would proceed as planned on Thursday, despite a new allegation of sexual misconduct against the judge — and criticized Democrats for a chaotic confirmation process.

“So far, it’s pretty much been an intergalactic freak show,” the Louisiana Republican said on “Fox News Sunday,” while offering that Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had done “the best he could” to make Kavanaugh’s raucous confirmation hearings run smoothly.

Story Continued Below

Kennedy slammed the committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, for sitting on accusations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh dating back to when he was in high school, which Kennedy said hadn't been flagged in any of the judge's six FBI background checks.

Regardless, Kennedy said that his committee will likely vote to send Kavanaugh’s nomination to the floor on Thursday as planned.

“I think the vote will be 11-10 … a straight party-line vote,” Kennedy said.

And despite staunch opposition from Democrats, he predicted that once the nomination comes up for a vote in the full chamber, “every Republican will vote for Judge Kavanaugh, [and] I think at least two and probably more Democrats will.”

“No fair-minded American can believe that he’s not qualified — he went to Yale law school, he didn’t get his law degree from Costco. He has a total command of Supreme Court precedent, I think he’s a legal rock star,” Kennedy said.

The senator said he was “embarrassed by the whole process,” which has seen confirmation hearings with near-constant interruptions by protesters.

And throughout the process, committee Democrats have accused Republicans of hiding documents and declared they were breaking committee rules to release certain documents only for it to be revealed that the documents in question had been approved for release.

Kennedy turned the secrecy accusation back on Democrats regarding the misconduct allegation, claiming that Republicans had not been allowed to see the accusatory letter from the woman, who wished to remain unidentified.

""This new allegation, I don’t know what our Democratic friends expect us to do,"" he said. ""Who are we gonna cross-examine? Senator Feinstein?”","jacquelyn martinap photo kavanaugh

Salvatore’s body was discovered later that night by his wife among crates of bananas and apples spattered with his blood. When the police arrived, Mrs. Cira appeared not to understand them, or at least she pretended she didn’t speak English. This wasn’t unusual; the police commonly ran into this problem with Italian immigrants who wanted nothing to do with law enforcement on any level. The most preyed-upon victims were often unwilling to give police any leads, even if they’d personally seen a suspect commit a crime against a loved one.

It’s not that Bellefontaine police lacked investigative skills. No law enforcement institution in the nation had been able to penetrate the criminal organizations that had begun quietly terrorizing cities across America, particularly those with large populations of immigrants from Italy. Nearly 6 million Italian immigrants entered the country in the last two decades of the 1800s and organized crime, common in their native country, often found its way across the Atlantic, too. Increasingly in the papers, the gruesome crimes were credited to “Black Hand” criminals because of several recovered threat letters penned by “La Mano Nero” that demanded exorbitant payments, or death.

Story Continued Below

The Bellefontaine cops searched the premises of Demar’s Fruit Importers and collected as much evidence as they could. What they found tipped them off to the idea that the murder was more sinister than a random killing. In the dead man’s pants pocket, there were two letters written in Italian. Knowing they had no chance of getting anywhere by interviewing friends or relatives of Cira, the cops were hopeful that the letters would lead to a break in the case. They also knew that their work was done, because the letters put the murder squarely under the jurisdiction of the United States Post Office Department and its inspectors.

In the year of the murder, before the FBI, the U.S. Post Office Inspection Service was the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country, and the only agency equipped to solve such a large-scale crime. At a time when the United States Post Office has found itself in the crosshairs of Republican cost-cutting—“on an unsustainable fiscal path,” in the words of one Donald Trump executive order—the story of Inspector Oldfield recalls a time when the nation’s mail delivery service was not just in the black, but the last line of defense against sophisticated, cross-country crimes.

The police brought the letter to the attention of Inspector Frank Oldfield at the Columbus Post Office. Since arriving in Columbus in 1901, 41-year-old Oldfield had become one of the most successful Post Office inspectors in the service. And he seemed to be the only one up to the task of solving the Black Hand riddle—infiltrating and taking down the first mafia ring in the United States.

While the “Black Hand” was a term used broadly in sensational news articles about Italian immigrant crimes in the media at the time, an organized crime ring was something that almost no one in law enforcement believed existed on American soil. “Experienced policemen say there is no Black Hand: that it is simply a convenient name adopted by any group of Italian criminals who wish to strike terror into their prospective victims,” the New York Times reported in 1910.

Meanwhile, loosely organized coalitions of extortionists, typically from Sicily where such networks were common, took root in American neighborhoods and thrived. One of them was the organization that Oldfield was about to bust open. Salvatore Arrigo, a fruit seller in Columbus, had connected with fruit sellers from Buffalo, New York, Pennsylvania and throughout Ohio, to form his own deceptively silly-sounding criminal ring: the Society of the Banana. By 1909, Arrigo had passed the leadership seat on to Sam Lima, another member of the group, who had much larger financial goals for the group’s criminal activities.

Little did Sebastian know, the Post Office had started watching him.

In late February 1909, Sebastian Lima, Sam’s brother-in-law, left the Society of the Banana headquarters in the back of Sam’s fruit shop in Marion, Ohio, an industrial suburb of Cleveland at the time. Sebastian walked three blocks south and arrived at the town’s post office, a corner storefront in the Masonic Temple building at 173 South Main Street, with a stack of letters addressed to cities in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York—invitations to a meeting of top bosses at the Society of the Banana. He asked the clerk for stamps and received tiny two-cent rectangles with perforated edges. The image on the stamp was a portrait in profile of George Washington, his face created from a series of minute strokes and dots. What Sebastian did not notice about the stamps the clerk gave him that day was that each one had a tiny red dot inside the letter o in the word “two.”

After the letters were ready to mail, Sebastian, dressed like a laborer in baggy pants and suspenders, handed the clerk $900 in neatly stacked bills.

Even though this was about twice the clerk’s annual salary, it did not surprise him. In fact, the clerk was already taking out a money order form for Sebastian to fill out. Transferring enormous amounts of money from the Marion post office to Sicily was a nearly everyday occurrence for Sam and Sebastian Lima, who the clerk, and everyone else, believed were brothers. It was assumed by many in the Italian community as well as throughout the city that the two had some kind of criminal business on the side, but the hefty influx of the Lima money into the economy and the Marion County Bank Company kept the gossipers at bay. The two Limas were careful to never make victims out of anyone in Marion, so no one could be sure where the incredible amounts of money came from. Sebastian filled out the money order. The recipient was his mother, Signora Carmella Barbara Lima, in Palermo. He paid for the transfer and left.

When Lima was out of sight the clerk took the copy of Lima’s money order and put it aside to give to the Post Office inspector, Frank Oldfield from Columbus, who’d come to work in the back office. Then he got out a sheet of stamps, put tiny dots in the o as he had been instructed, and put the sheets away so he wouldn’t accidentally use them on the next customer.

Now, all Oldfield had to do was wait for the invitations to reach the Society members and wait for the meeting at the fruit shop headquarters in Marion, scheduled for March 9, 1909.

Late in the afternoon of March 9, George Pate, Frank Oldfield’s fellow inspector, wearing a slouchy suit with his jacket unbuttoned, loitered in the arched entryway of the Marion train station and waited.

The Sicilians came on different trains from all different directions. On the Cincinnati inbound, an old man walked especially slowly: Salvatore Arrigo, the first Society of the Banana godfather. With him came another, younger man, who Pate knew must be Vincenzo Arrigo, the old man’s son. From Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Dennison, Ohio, came a long line of Sicilians who Pate checked off his list one by one—all Society of the Banana Members, including Antonio Lima, Sam Lima’s father, who was one of the highest up in the gang and had a long criminal history back in Palermo, Sicily.

When it was completely dark, all four inspectors on duty, including Oldfield, took to the streets to monitor the store from four different vantage points. It was a cold March evening and all of the windows were closed in the store. Oldfield wished he could hear what was going on, but even if he could have, there was no way to understand what was being said without a translator.

The lights at Lima’s burned on and flickered. The men had a lot of current business to cover. There was new ground to break as well. This was not an ad hoc gang of criminals haphazardly going after one victim, then the next. This was an interstate and intercontinental coalition. This was a covert and tight-knit confederation. And best of all to Sam Lima, the new and improved Society of the Banana was just like a corporation.

Sam Lima no longer saw himself as a criminal. He saw himself as a CEO, and he was about to be elected along those lines by the men at the meeting. He saw these regional leaders as his board of directors. He fancied himself like the shipping magnates in the Great Lakes or the oil and steel barons who built skyscrapers and put their names on top. The Society’s well-tuned extortion business was bringing in thousands of dollars every week. Once victims had succumbed to the threatening letters, with some having to be coerced under threat of death, they were described as “friends” of the Society and continued to make regular “tribute” payment to Sam Lima and his gang.

Fourteen Mafiosi sat cramped in Lima’s back room on chairs and fruit crates amid the cigar smoke. Commanding his audience, Sam Lima called the meeting to order. First order of business: a vote to elect a new “Boss” of the Society of the Banana. While the title was mostly a token, Arrigo, everyone knew, was too decrepit and unmotivated to remain in the position. A unanimous vote made Cincinnati saloon owner Francesco Spadaro the successor. Spadaro agreed to the title, happy to collect checks and use his saloon as cover for the group’s illegal activities. The real control was to go to the Society’s new director. All in favor of Sam Lima to be the new director of the Society of the Banana?

Thirteen hands rose.

Lima’s first order of business was to hammer out the Society’s new bylaws, which Oldfield found later in a raid of the building along with minutes of the meeting that night and the lists and ledgers with victims’ names. Over the evening, a brutal and sinister list of articles was proposed and agreed upon.

By Laws and Regulations of the Society of the Banana

Art. 1. The person who tries to reveal the secrets of this society will be punished with death;

Art. 2. A member who offends one of his companions, staining his honor, will be punished according to article 1;

Art. 3. The member who tries to do harm to another branch of the society, or to the family of other companions, if this harm shall have been grave, will be undressed and marked on his body with the mark of infamy and called with word of contempt, “Swindler,” and if the offense is more grave, he will be stabbed;

Art. 4. The person who is a coward and does not sustain the punishment assigned to him by the Society, he will be punished in accordance with Art. 3;

There were 16 articles in all.

With that squared away, Lima got down to the main business at hand. Each man came to the meeting with a list of “friends” for the Society to persecute. Having done their background research on the marks, they estimated net worth and monthly income and put a price on the victim’s “friendship.” Most of the proposed victims were fruit dealers or other merchants whom the Blackhanders did business with. Some were doctors or other professionals. All were Italian or Sicilian. In a leather-bound ledger, Sam Lima listed all the names. In the next column, he wrote the person’s address. In the third column was the amount of money the Society would require in order to let the victim and his family live.

The fourth column he left blank to fill in once payment or partial payment was made. If no payment was made, there would eventually be an x in that spot. They then set about creating an intricate plan to deliver their demands, not directly, but in a convoluted scheme of “under cover” letters sent to victims by other victims so that there would be no trail back to the Society of the Banana. There were 43 human targets on the list. The sums they would owe ranged from $200 to $20,000, for an initial payment.

If all went as planned, in the next month, the Society of the Banana would rake in $118,000.

The last thing on the agenda to discuss was something eating at Sam Lima: the defiant, dismissive John Amicon. How dare he disrespect the Society and publicly belittle Lima’s operation. John Amicon was one half of Amicon Brothers, the multi-million-dollar fruit distributor with a Columbus operation spanning a city block employing hundreds. Amicon was one of Lima’s biggest targets. After several death threats, not only would Amicon not pay, he publicly disrespected the criminals around Italian neighborhood in Columbus. “I’m not afraid of any man in the United States,” Amicon later told reporters. “I wouldn’t give them a cent if it cost me my life.” Oldfield learned later that Sam Lima had asked baby-faced Charlie Vicario from Bellefontaine, a city half way between Marion and Columbus, his favorite go-to hit man, to be on standby for an Amicon hit should it be needed. When Lima said the word, Vicario was to take a stiletto and put it into Amicon’s heart.

Lima would give Amicon one more chance to pay.

Outside Lima’s store at daybreak, the inspectors waited.

The Sicilians emerged from the shop one or two at a time. Over the next few days, without any clue they were being watched at every turn, the Society of the Banana began its new reign of terror: an all-out assault on 43 victims all at once.



***

Within a week of the meeting, the post office clerks and postmasters in Marion, Cincinnati, Columbus and a half-dozen other cities were tracking letters sent to a half-dozen states. Every post office where the letters left the hands of Society members was watched. Oldfield engaged local policemen, federal marshals, Secret Service and detectives from the largest private detective firm in the world to help investigate the letters’ final recipients. Frank and his fellow inspectors were completely overwhelmed. It was a tornado of activity on the part of the Society of the Banana that Oldfield didn’t have the manpower to match.

Still, they tried. Oldfield, Pate and Inspectors Edward Hutches, Raleigh Hosford and A.P. Owen went city to city, knocking on doors. Terrified Italians and Sicilians answered, wide-eyed and stuttering. “We know you just got a letter. What did it say?” the detectives asked. The inspectors were in plain clothes but had the unmistakable look of lawmen. Time and again, the immigrants denied that they had received a letter. Many said they didn’t speak English and gestured that they had no idea what was being asked of them.

In one case, Hosford got information that a certain victim paid off The Black Hand with a check. “Can we have the endorsed check?” Oldfield asked him after tracking him down at home. The canceled check bearing the endorsement of one of the blackmailers would be critical evidence. The victim shook as though breaking a fever, and flatly refused to give it up.

Two weeks went by, and the Black Hand case wasn’t getting anywhere even though Oldfield was blowing through an enormous amount of resources. With his army engaged all across Ohio and into Pennsylvania, travel expenses piled up.

Frank was so sure that he’d have dozens of victims stepping up and willing to testify in court that all of the expense would be worth it. In reality, he had zero.

Oldfield’s entire career was on the line. John Amicon was the only victim who had agreed to testify in court against The Black Hand. How could Frank prove there was a highly organized band of criminals with only one single victim coming forward?

Lima, like a mouse catching the scent of a cat, sent off a frenzy of letters to his board of directors warning members to lie low and watch their backs.

It was a warning that went out a little too late. There were 43 “cover letters” containing 43 extortion letters traveling on mail cars and mail pouches in every direction across the Great Lakes, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Chicago. Letters even went as far as Oregon, where Lima had a brother, Michelangelo, with a Portland operation identifying victims on the West Coast.

After few weeks with no sign of the lawman, Sam Lima, with renewed confidence, continued his operation. On March 29, postal clerks at Marion reported that Lima dropped off a stack of letters. As he was instructed, the mail clerk gave the unknowing Lima marked stamps and called Oldfield, who inspected the addressees on all the envelopes. Oldfield’s biggest hope was that the final recipient of the extortion letter inside one of those letters was John Amicon. Because without seeing a letter through its journey from Lima’s hands all the way to the sole victim who would testify, Oldfield had nothing on which to base an arrest warrant.

One was addressed to the teenage member of the gang, Tony Vicario, so Hutches went to Dennison to trail the young mafioso. While Hutches was following Vicario, the same scenario was unfolding all across the region, with other inspectors, postmasters, mailmen and lawmen watching the extortionists as they sent and received letters.

On March 30, Vicario arrived at the Dennison post office and checked his post office box. There were two letters. From behind two-way glass, D. C. Mann, the Dennison postmaster, and Inspector Hutches watched the young Sicilian open the envelopes and read the letters.

Then Postmaster Mann came out from behind the counter. “Wait, Vicario, there is some more mail for you.” Mann handed Vicario the Lima letter. Vicario opened it, took out another sealed letter and a slip of paper. From the angle where he was behind the glass, Hutches saw “Columbus, Ohio” on the address of the second letter but could not make out the name of the addressee. Still, he was hopeful—Columbus was where John Amicon lived.

The Post Office inspectors were interfering with Sam Lima’s bottom line, and he was determined to put a stop to the investigation. In the first week of April, Sebastian and Sam loitered around the Amicon Brothers warehouse and watched John Amicon and his brother Charles come and go from the saloon across the street. Amicon’s air was nonchalant. Rather than snarl at the Limas as he had before, John Amicon pretended not to notice them at all. That made Sam Lima all the more furious. There was still no money coming from either Amicon brother, so Lima made a decision. The time was right for a little reminder. The next day, a dynamite explosion blew the back porch off Charles Amicon’s home.

One day after the explosion, Columbus members of the Society of the Banana, the white-haired Severio Ventola and the young Salvatore Demma, went to the Amicon Brothers’ giant warehouse on Naghten Street to further intimidate the brothers.

“If you boys will let those fellows alone now and not bother with this investigation, you won’t receive any more letters or have any more trouble,” Ventola told Charles Amicon, who later related the conversation to Inspector Oldfield in a deposition.

Charles knew that proposing that his brother back off was fruitless. But he was so rattled by the explosion at his house that he made a futile attempt to get his brother to let it all go. John refused to even discuss it.

A week went by with John and Charles Amicon at odds on how to handle their predicament. It had been a month since the Society of the Banana meeting. Money was rolling in. Sam Lima, once again, felt unstoppable.

Then on April 8, a letter from Dennison, Ohio, came by mail carrier to Columbus, addressed to Signore Giovanni Amicone, John Amicon’s Italian name. Amicon immediately called Oldfield. When the inspector came, Amicon handed him the letter. Oldfield took out his magnifying glass and looked closely at the stamp. Inside the letter o in “two” was a tiny red dot.

Amicon opened the letter. Inside was a threat to his life written in Italian and a demand for payment of $10,000. He translated the message to Oldfield. It was in the same handwriting as the letter that had left Sam Lima’s shop for Dennison 10 days before. After nearly three grueling months, Inspector Oldfield now had enough evidence to report to U.S. Attorney William Day and have a federal judge sign a warrant to arrest Sam Lima.

Or so he believed. Oldfield’s hopes were dashed when Day told him there wasn’t enough evidence to get a conviction.

Oldfield refused to give up. Over the next six months, he gathered an army. He enlisted lawman across government agencies. He hired private detectives. He called up postal clerks and mail carriers. He collected intelligence in the Italian communities. And most importantly, with patience and finesse, he was able to convince dozens more victims to testify against the Society of the Banana. On a cold winter day in January 1910, Oldfield carried seven steamer trucks of evidence into a Toledo courtroom and took the seat as the star witness in the first federal trial of a Sicilian organized crime ring in America.

It’s a part of the state full of peanut and feed corn farms, and voting blocs that over the past two decades have been more favorable to Republican candidates. By the time she reached her first stop of the day, a diner in the tiny town of Fitzgerald, nearly 200 miles from Atlanta, it had been nearly two hours since she had seen the last yard sign with her name on it.

Abrams is polling in a virtual tie with Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the Republican nominee for governor, but strategists on both sides say if she is going to make history as the first black female governor in the nation, she first has to make inroads in the rural parts of the state, which tend to be whiter and more conservative. In short, she has to appeal to voters for whom a black woman with a Yale law degree from the deep-blue island of big-city Atlanta represents a major departure from their ideal candidate for statewide office.

Story Continued Below

Which is how Abrams, 44, came to be sitting at a glossy conference room table at the Valdosta Chamber of Commerce introducing herself as a businesswoman-turned-legislator and making the argument that expanding Medicaid and broadband access, providing quality child care for working parents and education for young children, are not just progressive talking points but pragmatic, pro-growth policies.

“The challenge in Georgia is that for every good thing we have, we have so many competing issues, competing needs that, I think, unfortunately, have gone unaddressed for the last 15 years,” Abrams told the 10 chamber members seated around her. “And my mission is to continue to move forward on the good and then make sure we start to pick up where we falter. For example, being one of the best places in the country to do business is a great thing, but we’re No. 22 of 25 when it comes to small businesses, to mainstream businesses. And that isn’t just an Atlanta issue, it’s a state issue.”

The first question was delivered with a polite smile … and a point.

“All that sounds great,” said Jan Brice, chairman of the chamber and executive director of a local senior living facility, who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and traveled to Washington, D.C., for his inauguration. “But, I mean, are you talking about raising taxes?”

True to her technocrat tendencies, Abrams’ answer sounded like it was pulled from the executive summary of a think-tank white paper: “You don’t have to raise taxes to do this,” Abrams said, hands in front of her as she doled out statistics about Georgia’s robust budget. “Our issue is not resources. Our issue is priorities, and having sat on the Appropriations Committee and the Ways and Means Committee in the Georgia Assembly, I can tell you that we have the resources necessary to meet the needs of the state of Georgia. We haven’t allocated properly.”

Kemp, her opponent, and his allies had been painting her in television ads as the second coming of Bernie Sanders, but Abrams touted her experience in the General Assembly finding new revenue streams that could be used to pay for her proposals, making sure to highlight where she agreed with Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican.

There was a pause before Brice said: “Good answer,” prompting chuckles from the audience.

During her three-day, six-stop swing in southern Georgia, Abrams never breathed the names of the national figures who have made her campaign a liberal cause célèbre. No Elizabeth Warren, no Kamala Harris, no Cory Booker. While the Democratic Party at large might view her as marching in lockstep with the progressive uprising embodied by the insurgent campaigns of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Ayanna Presley in Massachusetts, Abrams, like her counterpart Andrew Gillum in Florida, is straining to avoid the socialist mantle. She argues that the best card she can play to skeptical Republicans is to highlight her own roots in rural Mississippi and to frame her brand of progressivism as less like an American version of socialism that Republicans abhor and more like the sensible policies of any responsible governor.

“I think part of the narrative that’s started to develop is that there’s something not pragmatic about expanding Medicaid in Georgia,” Abrams told me later as we sat in her campaign SUV parked outside the Seminole County Elementary School in Donalsonville, a modest crossroads surrounded by peanut farms. “And my point is to demonstrate that regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, governors across the country have recognized the necessity of Medicaid expansion. And probably the most famous conservative governor would be Mike Pence when he served as governor of Indiana. The most liberal would be Jerry Brown, who’s governor of California, and what I do is to try to juxtapose the two of them to demonstrate that Georgia’s decision not to expand Medicaid is not grounded in pragmatism. It’s grounded in the false ideology that’s denying access to health care, especially in South Georgia.”

So far what few polls there are show that she has work to do making this case, at least in this skeptical corner of the state (“It’s part of the state that Republicans know they’re going to win, so why poll it?” quipped Republican pollster Brent Buchanan.) In the past two gubernatorial elections, Deal won the entire central and eastern part of Georgia. He won all but one of the counties Abrams visited on her recent tour—three of those five counties by double-digit margins. In 2016, the entire region preferred Trump over Hillary Clinton even though Trump carried the state only narrowly. To win the governorship, Abrams will have to dominate the reliably Democratic parts of the state farther north and also hit a respectable margin in those rural Republican-leaning counties. But, like Democratic candidates before her, she has a significant gap of enthusiasm to overcome. A July SurveyUSA poll found Abrams trailing Kemp 55 percent to 34 percent among rural voters.

She doesn’t need to win over all of them, but she needs to cut into the support that Kemp gets almost reflexively. “I would assume she needs to win somewhere between 38 and 42 percent in that part of the state,” Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman said of Abrams.

If she wins with this strategy, rather than relying on urban voters to carry her, it will offer evidence that a black woman from a liberal metropolis can win a Republican-leaning state with something approximating a bipartisan coalition. For that to happen, though, it will take converting voters like Jan Brice, and that will be a major challenge.

“I haven’t really made up my mind, because I like Brian Kemp,” Brice said after the chamber roundtable, “but I was very impressed with what she said.”

Abrams, though, even gets pushback from more conservative Democrats in this part of the state. At the stop at the diner in Fitzgerald, Pence Kaminsky, a former local official, said Abrams’ position on tearing down the massive Confederate monument known as Stone Mountain was out of touch with the region. (Indeed, driving down to one of the final stops on the tour, staffers noted a prominently displayed flag for a chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.)

“That’s just ridiculous,” said Kaminsky, a self-described “yellow dog Democrat” who was going to vote for Abrams. “That’s something that lets people know that she’s an extremist.”



***

Abrams is not the first Democrat who had to win over the state’s more conservative voters. It’s just gotten a lot harder to do over the past couple of decades.

The last two Democrats to serve as governor—Zell Miller and Roy Barnes—came from outside Atlanta and were exposed to politics at an early age. But since 2003, when Sonny Perdue became the first Republican to take control of the governor’s mansion since Reconstruction, the state has moved relentlessly into the Republican column even as Atlanta’s population has surged. By 2010, every statewide office was under Republican control. Indeed, so impregnable has the Republican hold become on the state that the most recent Democratic candidate, Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, couldn’t manage to come within 8 percentage points of Deal in the 2014 election. Political pedigree means little now if it’s attached to the wrong party.

Despite his own track record, Carter says he still subscribes to the belief that Democrats can regain their former sway with rural voters.

“My belief about rural Georgia is that folks feel alienated from the mainstream elements of the economy and if you could convince those people that feel alienated to bring them back in, then you’re going to get some real votes,” he said. “If you can convince those people who are alienated that you’re the right person to bring them back in, then you’re going to get some real votes.”

The question is whether Abrams’ background—so different from those of Carter, Barnes and Miller—is an asset or a liability.

Abrams grew up poor in rural Mississippi. She attended Spelman College in Atlanta on a mix of merit- and need-based aid and graduated magna cum laude, ultimately earning a law degree from Yale (she also has a master’s in public policy from the University of Texas at Austin). While at Spelman, she emerged as an outspoken activist amid protests and riots in Atlanta after the Rodney King verdict in 1992, which put the political bug in her ear that would blossom first into a job as a deputy attorney for Atlanta and later into a seat in the General Assembly. Prior to joining the legislature, Abrams co-founded a financial services firm and a separate beverage company catering to young children. Under the pen name Selena Montgomery, Abrams wrote eight romantic suspense novels. She also founded the New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan organization aimed at registering thousands of minority voters throughout the state.

Few viable Democratic candidates for Georgia governor have been as unapologetically liberal as Abrams (during the tour, without caution, she said climate change is real and she doesn’t think assault weapons should be ubiquitous), but when she talks about her time in the state's General Assembly, where she served as minority leader in the House of Representatives, she often highlights examples of her work with Republicans. One of the bigger examples is her work with Deal to reform the HOPE scholarship program, which used state lottery money to pay tuition for needy students but ran into funding problems. In 2011, Abrams was also largely responsible for blocking what Georgia Republicans initially portrayed as a major income-tax cut. Abrams, a lawyer who specializes in taxes, analyzed the proposal and found that it would amount to a major tax increase. She brought her analysis back to her colleagues and worked to persuade them to vote against it. The proposal was defeated.

Still, she has continued to praise Deal for his work on issues that she holds dear, including criminal justice reform.

“What Nathan Deal has been willing to do—and I’ve been able to work in concert with him on this for seven years—is actually address the disconnect between a state that wants to be the best state in the nation but had some of the most draconian criminal justice rules in the country,” Abrams told me during our interview in her SUV. “So I give him entirely the greatest credit, because he did good work.”

The broader strategy behind this is similar to what other Democrats vying for statewide positions in deep-red Southern states have used. Skip the talk about divisive issues such as Obamacare, immigration and same-sex marriage and do what Doug Jones said he did in his victorious Alabama Senate campaign: focus on “bread-and-butter dinner table” issues.

Standing in a pair of brown Hunter rain boots at the edge of a river at a farm in Mitchell County, Abrams listened intently as peanut farmer Glenn Cox and his daughter Casey Cox explained the technical aspects of the farm’s irrigation system and moisture sensors.

Abrams mentioned she “got to learn variable rate irrigation when I went to the Stripling Center about four years ago,” a reference to the University of Georgia’s C.M. Stripling Irrigation Research Park.

“She knows all about it,” Casey Cox , 27, joked.

“She’s letting me pretend I know what I’m talking about,” Abrams laughed. The conversation then moved to what a governor could do for farmers in Georgia.

Abrams peppered Glenn Cox with the kind of questions a politician asks of a potential constituent with whom she has little in common: “So what do you need the governor to know about how we make certain there are more places for growing up and down the river?”

More attention to rural Georgia, Cox said, explaining that the region needs help with better internet connectivity (an Abrams policy point). Cox mentioned precision agriculture, a technology-focused type of farming that Abrams conceded she needed to learn more about.

“Talk to me about precision ag,” Abrams said.

After the tour, the elder Cox said Abrams’ questions seemed informed. Abrams, Cox said, could possibly change voters’ minds in the area “if they met her.” But south Georgia, Cox noted, usually favors Republican candidates.

“But you know how things work,” he said. “They got to meet her.”

But their conversation indicated it’s much more complicated than just shaking hands and agreeing on a couple of convincing answers about expanding broadband or more rural education funding. The simple math is that this is a reliably Republican region and voters need a compelling reason to change their minds.

Abrams, speaking at a packed barbershop in nearby Albany later in the day, started her remarks acknowledging her location.

“I’m here because I know Albany is the center of opportunity in southwest Georgia. I know that when Albany does well, southwest Georgia does well, but if we don’t lift up southwest Georgia, Georgia is not going to do as well as it could,” Abrams said. Albany’s unemployment rate has hovered above the rest of the state’s for more than half a decade. “I want to be clear, I’m not running to be the governor of Atlanta, I’m running to be the governor of all of Georgia.”

This stop was slightly more familiar to Abrams: a racially mixed crowd of men and women. Attendees cheered for Abrams and peppered her with questions on whether her campaign was prepared for Republican hijinks to stop supporters from voting for her. Even among her supporters at the event there was uncertainty about whether she could actually win over the region.

Bruce Capps, a retired white insurance business owner in the audience who described Abrams as “terrific,” nevertheless flinched when asked whether Abrams could beat Kemp in southwest Georgia.

“It’s going to be tough,” Capps said, saying the numbers for Abrams are there but that the question is motivation—“getting those voters registered and out to the polls.”

A day later, Abrams was back in Atlanta to deliver a speech at the Georgia Democratic Convention. Abrams wasn’t the only candidate promising to win over voters across the state, but delivering faster broadband to assuage conservative farmers hundreds of miles away was a much less pressing concern than making electoral history. And while bipartisanship sounds great when you’re sitting in the conference room of the Valdosta Chamber of Commerce, no one in the convention hall was interested in celebrating the accomplishments of a Republican governor.

“We have a chance to elect the nation’s first African-American woman governor,” Rep. Hank Johnson cheered in his speech shortly before Abrams took the stage.

The crowd roared. They already knew everything they needed to know about her.","cm stripling irrigation research park

Robert Menendez with just a 6-point lead over challenger Bob Hugin, 43 percent to 37 percent. Robert Menendez’s political fight for survival

It wasn’t supposed to be like this for Sen. Robert Menendez.

Though the New Jersey Democrat is still favored to defeat Republican Bob Hugin in November, Menendez is being forced to fight to keep his seat. Hugin’s relentless negative ad campaign and deep pockets, combined with Menendez’s unpopularity among New Jersey voters, are making the race closer than most anticipated.

Story Continued Below

Now, national Democrats are putting resources into a state that normally would not be in play.

“It’s a single-digit race. I think, nationally, the Democrats are trying to bail him out. I think people know that Menendez is corrupt. They want change,” said Doug Steinhardt, chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee. “They see Bob Hugin as a sensible alternative, and he’s making a good case for himself.”

A spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said the group has made a “six-figure” coordinated ad buy with the Menendez campaign. The North Jersey Record reported in late August the committee had spent nearly $450,000 on cable television ads to help Menendez. The DSSC didn’t do any coordinated spending with the Menendez campaign in 2012, according to Federal Election Commission records.

The national effort comes comes as Democrats are already working against a map in which several of their incumbents are vulnerable, including Florida’s Bill Nelson, North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp and Missouri’s Claire McCaskill.

Still, party officials remain confident Menendez will prevail.

“While former pharma CEO Bob Hugin has already spent over $11 million on TV and is using the fortune he made raising the costs of prescription drugs for cancer patients to try to buy the Senate seat, the Menendez campaign smartly held their resources until their ads would have maximum impact in the closing weeks of the election,” DSCC spokesman David Bergstein said in a email.

Some Democrats were nervous last fall when Menendez, immediately after his six-week federal corruption trial ended with a hung jury, made it clear he had no plans to retire from the seat he’s held since 2006. Still, with President Donald Trump deeply unpopular in New Jersey and Republicans not having much of a candidate bench, most in the party assumed Menendez was a shoo-in for reelection. After all, New Jersey hasn’t elected a Republican to the Senate in nearly a half-century.

What party officials didn’t count on was the emergence of Hugin, who made tens of millions of dollars a year as CEO of New Jersey pharmaceutical company Celgene. As of July, Hugin had pumped $15.5 million of his own money into the race, and, by all appearances, he is ready to spend more.

Hugin began hitting the airwaves months ago with ads zeroing in on Menendez’s trial, portraying the senator as corrupt. Though Menendez avoided conviction, the Senate Ethics Committee admonished him, saying he broke federal law by accepting and not initially reporting gifts from his friend and co-defendant Salomon Melgen. That has provided even more fodder for Hugin.

Only now is Menendez is fighting back, running ads that paint Hugin as a robber baron who profited from gouging and endangering patients when he headed Celgene.

During Hugin’s tenure, the ads say, Celgene repeatedly raised the price of a key cancer drug. The company also settled for $280 million a Justice Department fraud lawsuit that it marketed two cancer drugs for unapproved treatments. Hugin left Celgene shortly before announcing his run for Senate.

Hugin’s more recent ads have defended his role at Celgene and noted that Menendez has received about $1 million since 2006 from pharmaceutical companies. (Hugin doesn’t note that he and his company were among those donors.)

Menendez’s commercials have yet to highlight — but almost certainly will — Hugin’s support in 2016 for Trump, whose approval rating in New Jersey in a recent Quinnipiac University poll was 33 percent — below Menendez’s 40 percent approval rating.

The latest Quinnipiac poll, released in late August, showed Menendez with just a 6-point lead over Hugin, 43 percent to 37 percent, down from the 17-point lead he held in a similar poll conducted in March.

Republicans in statewide New Jersey polls tend to fare better in the dead of summer than when the campaign ramps up in the fall; the August poll put Hugin’s support at about the same level as that of recent GOP Senate candidates at similar points in their campaigns.

Still, there were troubling numbers for Menendez in the latest poll.

His approval rating was a net negative 7 points, but his favorability rating was far worse — just 29 percent favorable to 47 percent unfavorable. And by a 49 percent to 16 percent margin, voters felt Menendez was involved in “serious wrongdoing.”

Hugin, meanwhile, remains largely unknown, with 54 percent of voters saying they didn’t know enough about him to form an opinion.

Menendez spokesman Steve Sandberg said in a statement that while a self-funded candidate like Hugin, with virtually unlimited resources and riches, presents “challenges, we like our position right now in this race.“

“The support for Bob Menendez is as wide as it is deep, and the enthusiasm among Democrats heading into a midterm has never been higher,"" Sandberg said.

Hugin spokesman Nick Iacovella said in a statement that the Republican is in a strong position because “Bob Hugin is the best Bob in this race and New Jersey voters — Democrats, Independents, and Republicans — know it’s time for change.

While Menendez has publicly expressed confidence, his own party’s base sent him a warning shot in New Jersey’s June primary, when his unfunded and virtually unknown Democratic challenger, Lisa McCormick, got 38 percent of the vote and won several rural counties.

On the plus side, Democrats point out, Menendez got almost 100,000 more votes than Hugin. Even taking into account Democrats’ 900,000 voter registration advantage in New Jersey, their 19.6 percent turnout in the primary was higher than Republicans’ 17.6 percent.

Jay Lassiter, a liberal activist and columnist, said he and many others aren’t happy with Menendez.

""There are people like me just saying, 'How the hell could we let this happen? How can we let him get another crack at this, given that he was never close to being exonerated, given the millions and millions of dollars he spent?'"" Lassiter said.

But, Lassiter said, he’ll probably vote for Menendez — a sentiment he’s heard from many others who share his political beliefs.

“I’ll lament him [Menendez] ... on Facebook,” Lassiter said, “and I’ll have a thousand people reminding me that he’s the only person separating us from a pro-Trump guy in New Jersey, which is compelling.”","democratic senatorial campaign committee

This was put to the test when Capcom published a streaming version of Resident Evil 7 for the Switch back in May, and now Ubisoft will try the concept with Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey. Like the Resident Evil release, this will be in Japan only.

The announcement was part of Japan’s Nintendo Direct, not the one here in the U.S. Kotaku noted (citing Siliconera) that Phantasy Star Online 2 had been streamed for the Switch in Japan back in April, as well.

While Odyssey on the Switch is not coming to the West and there’s no indication this region will see streaming games any time soon, it at least shows Nintendo’s console has a capability similar to Sony’s PlayStation Now service, which turns four in January.

It’s also possible that the Japanese market or customers’ purchasing priorities make this viable for third party publishers in Japan, where it’s less workable in the West. Resident Evil 7 was offered as a rental, after all, getting half a year for about $20. Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey is being offered as a daily rental (roughly $6.50) and a full version. Western audiences may be more inclined to pay fees to stream games if it’s for an all-you-can eat subscription, like PlayStation Now, as opposed to a game-by-game basis.

Here’s the announcement made for Japanese viewers, for those interested (or if you speak/understand Japanese). The cloud version of Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey is launching the same day as the other versions of the game worldwide, Oct. 5. In the west, users will get it on PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One.","phantasy star online

Fans got all of the league and its players, sure, but they only got them for one-off play-now games — no season-long franchise, or even a playoff tournament — and the generic commentary didn’t mention anyone, team or player, by name.

So July’s announcement that women would be part of NBA Live 19’s career suite was, sure, another milestone. In light of the skimpy, almost thrown-in treatment of the WNBA that followed such a praiseworthy announcement last year, EA Sports deserved a little more scrutiny of what it was really bringing to its basketball franchise this time.

After taking a woman to level 20 in The One, as the career mode is called, I think the developers at EA Tiburon have given women’s basketball, its players and fans a rather sincere and reasonably deep mode. No, there isn’t a WNBA component for a created female star to explore the way men can also play league games in the NBA. Even acknowledging the work it would take to build what is a separate career mode, that seems to be a glaring shortcoming since the NBA is such a large component of the male player’s experience in NBA Live 19.

But the inclusion of women still deepens The One and makes the pick-up games and streetball tour — which is better than half of The One’s offerings — more interesting, whether the user is playing as a woman or not.

Mixed-gender team competition: A sports video game first

NBA Live 19 isn’t the first licensed sports video game to include women. EA Sports’ FIFA series has had women’s national teams for the past four editions, and the NHL series has let users create female players since 2011, including in the Be A Pro mode. EA Sports UFC 2 and 3 have also featured women fighters, and given them parity in the career mode that is such a strong appeal to that game.

NBA Live 19 is a first, however, in that it offers true mixed-gender team competition. It’s one thing to give a user the choice of creating a woman and placing her on a team with men. That’s nice, but it’s effectively an avatar option, nothing more. It’s another thing to have women as AI-controlled teammates and opponents, as they are in NBA Live 19. Players will encounter women on the Pro-Am World Tour (and in the user-populated Live Run and Court Battles) whether they’re playing as one or not.

That did a couple of things for me: First, it was more interesting to see who I’d be getting in the opposing squads on the Tour, often themed to a particular city or style. Sometimes they would be all-male teams. Other times, players like Candace Parker or Allie Quigley cameoed. Women also gave a little heft to the fictitious world tour I put my created male player on. In the pre-game cinematics where the gang shows up and shoots around, it sort of made sense to me that this was a kind of barnstorming promotion where top women’s stars would be found alongside men, probably in something I’d watch on ESPN on a summer afternoon. The real-world growth in interest in exhibitions like the Drew League and the Goodman League (both of which are part of The One) shows there’s plenty of spectator appetite for less formal hoops competition.

As for gameplay, in NBA Live 19 women and men share the same system of attributes, animations and outcomes. (Women do have specific animations, such as Brittney Griner’s jump shot or Maya Moore’s layup — which can be assigned to male players, too.) What this means is that someone rated an 80 in speed will run at the same pace, male or female, and so a woman with an 80 in the dunk attribute is going to be as prolific as a man with the same number, too.

This is mostly inconspicuous and I didn’t see women glaringly overrated to force parity with men. But it is noticeable in player creation, because women in a post position will still need to be between 6-foot-4 and 7 feet (or more). The WNBA’s tallest active player is Griner at 6-8. So users looking for authenticity in height for their female baller should consider her style of play more than her position, and maybe move someone like Elena Delle Donne, listed as a small forward at 6-5, out to shooting guard. The fact she’s classified a “wing scorer” is more important than the position she plays, anyway. If you’re creating a woman and expecting to rebound and be a defensive wall down low, she should be taller than any you’ve ever seen.

Height disparities can manifest in some other ways that are, frankly, kind of funny. AI teammates will switch off after a bit if a user leaves their defensive assignment for someone else, which lets the user forcibly create some mismatches (with attendant risks elsewhere). It was amusing to take over 7-footer Joel Embiid in a 5-on-5 game and move him out over Maya Moore (6 feet tall). She squirted around him because she was faster, Embiid was out of position and not the best on defense. But when she drove the baseline later, Embiid was there to park her floater five rows up the bleachers, as well he should.

Superstar street ballers, but no real team experience

World Tour, Court Battles and Live Run (“The Streets” component of The One) presents a very rollicking, wide-open pace of play, as one would expect of a streetball exhibition. But after about five tournaments on the tour I began to notice the difference in that series as opposed to what my male player was doing in the NBA. The Pro-Am world tour is very star-driven, and the star it defers to is the one the user controls. A modestly skilled player can still take over a game and run the entirety of the offense through their created player, male or female. There are no set plays, no substitutions (of course) and the games to 21 are obviously a lot shorter than a league game of even five-minute quarters.

So the lack of a WNBA component to The One’s career means the user with a female star misses out on a more traditional, team-oriented style play that male players get as NBA professionals. There are distinctions to the men’s and women’s games, and it’s not just the height and mass of the participants. Women’s basketball is more about spacing, cutting and ball movement, where isolation plays are more viable in the men’s game. I do have enough players in the cast I’ve unlocked to create an entirely female squad. But they’re still running a pick-up style of play, and moreover, all of them are WNBA all-stars. A true career mode would give me more role players to work with and against.

Fans of women’s basketball will expect full parity in future games. EA Sports has to know this.

Last year at a preview event, EA Sports announced the WNBA’s debut in NBA Live 18, and senior producer Mike Mahar from EA Tiburon told me they were already looking at ways to integrate them into the rest of the game. I thought we might even see created women players in NBA Live 18 post-launch, but at least we got them this year. And The One has a presentation that subtly recognizes the player’s gender. It earnestly sells the vicarious fantasy of a playground legend career, as much as the careers of MLB The Show and FIFA indulge me.

Even if The Streets (which is all the non-NBA play) in The One is NBA Live 19’s most creative and interesting component, and women are at full parity there, EA Tiburon has still opened the ball to women’s hoops. Its fans will expect full parity in the rest of the game, and soon. The design choices made in NBA Live 19 are understandable for now, and for sure the work required of bringing the WNBA into The One is not as simple as repurposing assets or swapping uniforms. There’s scheduling, there’s a postseason and there’s all kinds of unsexy stuff to support a multi-year career, like injury, retirement and trade logic, plus a draft and new ringer players to join the league every year.

But a third year where women players have fewer options than male counterparts will take the shine off their presence as a milestone or a neat feature, and there’ll be reasonable grumbling that women are second-class participants in the game. Let’s give EA Sports a little forbearance in meeting new expectations, just a week now after the launch of the game creating them. For the next year at least, EA Tiburon’s developers have given women a meaningful debut. They’re fun as hell to play. Most importantly, women contribute to the whole experience of NBA Live 19’s career, not just the parts where I’m playing as one.","elena delle donne

U for Nintendo Switch. The Switch version of the WiiU game introduces two new characters: Nabbit, a character who first appeared in the WiiU version, and the one and only Toadette.

The trailer showed off some of their new moves and all was fine and dandy and perfectly standard ... except for one of Toadette’s more alarming powers: Peachette.

Ah, yes. Peachette.

So apparently one of Toadette’s special powers is that she can use a mushroom crown to transform into a Peach-lookalike. It’s not just a Peach-lookalike, though. It’s a Peach-Toadette fusion — Toadette doesn’t simply mask herself with Peach’s identity a la Polyjuice potion-style. Nay, there’s just enough of a difference with Peachette that it appears to be a completely separate identity, more than a simple glamour or mask. It is Toadette, but as a human, taking inspiration from Peach to mold into her new higher-life form identity. This, of course, holds deeper implications for the Mario universe.

First, there’s the implication that this transformation is the natural second life stage for Toads. Do all Toads possess the power to turn into humans? Are all humans in the Mario universe simply metamorphosed Toads? Did Toadette unlock the genetic tools necessary to evolve into a higher life form?

However absurd-sounding, there’s actual historical Mario evidence to back this claim up.

Peach’s first appearance was in 1985 in Super Mario Bros. In the United States version, she was named Princess Toadstool. And even though she looked decidedly human-like in Super Mario Bros., a strategy guide published at the time called How to Win at Super Mario Bros. depicted her pre-Bowser kidnapping, where she looked quite very mushroom-like.

Princess Peach/Toadstool’s father, The Mushroom King, also sports this more Mushroom-esque design.

It should be noted, however, that there is another picture of Princess Peach/Toadstool on the cover of this guide, where she’s depicted in her more human-like state. Separate note: Bowser also looks drastically different from the design we now know and love, but at least he somewhat resembles the creature we identify him as.

Let’s have a refresher. Toadette can evolve into a human-like creature. Peach was once more Mushroom-like and known as Princess Toadstool, before Bowser kidnapped her.

Was it Bowser who “evolved” Peach into the human-form we know today? Did she fully embrace her upgraded form and shed all remnants of her Mushroom past, taking on the name Peach? Did the Mushroom people accept her right away or was her new identity met with resistance?

What happened to her poor father? His last appearance in a 1989 coloring book was decidedly human-like, but he’s since vanished — did Peach grow power-hungry?

And circling back to Peachette — has the key to Mushroom-Human evolution been kept under lock for this long? Why is Toadette the only one given access to this ability? Is this evolution restricted to female Mushrooms only? Has Peach been keeping the secret to species uplift away from her people so she can reap the benefits of the caste system?

There’s the counterargument of Baby Peach as character, which does nullify Peach’s specific evolution if you count Baby Peach as canon, but it does not change the fact that there is an object in the Mario universe that can uplift an entire species. If Peach knows about this — well, she knows that she’s not going to be royalty among Mushrooms if they all become humans.

As if that is not enough, there’s also the question of why Toadette choses to replicate Peach’s form so closely? Is she envious of her supreme ruler? Is Peach some ideal she strives for, the perfect form of femininity that all Mushroom people uphold? Or is this something darker? Does Toadette want to usurp Peach? Does she want to become her?

There are lots of dark questions that arise with Peachette’s existence and few answers in sight.

“Some games, such as Fortnite, can be played online without a Nintendo Switch membership,” Nintendo explains.

This is great news to the legions of Fortnite fans who enjoy playing the game on the go, and it’s a smart move for Nintendo to carve out an exemption for the massive free-to-play game. Fortnite was also the first game to allow standard voice chat through any headset without the use of Nintendo’s smartphone app; Nintendo seems comfortable making sure the game doesn’t have to conform to some of its more arcane restrictions on the Nintendo Switch.","popular online battle royale

It took hundreds of developers multiple years to create the game, which likely costed anything up to $100 million to create.

Those numbers are a long way from the first Spider-Man, which was created by one woman, working alone, over a period of six months. Laura Nikolich worked at toy company Parker Brothers in the early 1980s, and as part of a small team that created licensed games for the Atari 2600. Her colleagues worked on Star Wars games, while she was given Spider-Man.

Nikolich created a vertical-scrolling game in which Spider-Man swings across buildings, taking out enemies along the way. They, in turn, are trying to snip Spider-Man’s web. Spidey avoids bombs thrown by Green Goblin, finally taking out the game’s villain. The game then starts over, just a little faster this time. There’s no ending.

“I had full creative control, and decided to go with a vertical scrolling game,” said Nikolich in a phone interview with Polygon. “The Star Wars game we were working on was vertical-scrolling, which was more difficult, technically. They wanted to have the Walkers moving along. A vertical game also made sense, because Spider-Man swings across tall buildings.”

Spider-Man came out in 1982, and was backed by a television advertising campaign. The Atari video game market meltdown was still more than a year away, and Spider-Man was a commercial success, and is still regarded fondly by 2600 aficionados.

Nikolich, who is now retired, fell into game design almost by accident. She earned an MBA and a Bachelors’ degree in engineering technology, with a particular interest in computer programming. Subsequently, she worked at a nuclear power plant, programming monitoring systems.

At an employment fair, she fell into conversation from some people from Parker Brothers. “They really wanted me to come and work for them,” she recalled. “I had the skills, but as a woman, I also helped them hit diversity hiring quotas. So they worked hard to persuade me. And when I worked there, they always treated me well.”

She said that some of her friends at the time thought she was making a mistake. “They couldn’t understand why I’d go and make video games,” she said. “Games were seen as trivial, but I guess, looking at how far games have come, my instincts were right.”

Nikolich describes her time at Parker Brothers as the best of her career. The small team of developers would visit coin-op arcades in order to generate ideas. They’d discuss their work over dinner, socializing as they figured out specific programming problems.

“We all worked hard. We were solving problems that hadn’t been solved before. It was fun.”

In those days, licencors such as Marvel were happy to take money from games companies and stand back. Nikolich said she had no contact with Marvel at the time, not even to present the game’s design. It’s a long way from today’s contracts, in which games companies work closely with rights holders on every last in-game detail.

Following Spider-Man, Nikolich made a Care Bears game. Soon after, the Atari market crashed in the wake of the ET debacle, and she was laid off. By the time consumers came around to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985, Nikolich had started a family, going on to raise four children.

She says the Laura Nikolich of 1982 would have been astonished at the “cinematic quality and the popularity” of today’s games. And she still has a connection to the games industry: Two of her children work for top developers. Kyle Nikolich is a senior technical artist at DICE. Evan Nikolich is design lead at Bungie.

“Games were always a part of the family when the children were growing up,” she said. “And I think they were proud of the fact that I’d made a game. I’m certainly proud of it.”","spiderman nikolich

Nintendo Switch Online has been in the works since the console’s first year on the market, but Nintendo has only recently begun to shed light on what to expect from the upcoming subscription service.

We’ve compiled everything we know about the service so far, and will continue to update as more info becomes available.

What is Nintendo Switch Online?

Nintendo Switch Online is Nintendo’s subscription-based online service for Switch games. It works with an accompanying mobile app, where players will be able to access and interact with a number of exclusive features.

What features does it offer?

The main feature of Nintendo Switch Online is online multiplayer for games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2 and Arms. At launch, Nintendo offered multiplayer connectivity for free, but as of September 2018, Switch owners have to pay to play those games online.

There are two other big selling points for Nintendo Switch Online: the ability to play a library of Nintendo Entertainment System games, which will be updated on a continuing basis and have online capabilities, and cloud storage for save data.

Wait, will I still be able to play any of my games online for free?

Nintendo says that you will have to check out either its website, the Switch eShop or the game’s packaging to see if a Nintendo Switch Online subscription is required. But the majority of Nintendo’s own games will require the service to get into online multiplayer.

What about the Switch’s other, current internet-connected capabilities?

Nintendo says that the Switch eShop, registering and managing friends, screenshot sharing to social media, Nintendo Switch Parental Controls, system and software updates, and the regularly updated Nintendo Switch News feed won’t require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.

What does the Nintendo Switch Online mobile app do?

The Switch Online app, which is available for Android and iOS devices, is required for in-game voice chat. It also encourages players to connect and invite each other into multiplayer game sessions. The app also offers “special features” for certain games; currently the only game to use it in that way is Splatoon 2, which offers battle stats and in-game purchases through the app.

OK, what about cloud saves — is using Nintendo Switch Online the only way to back up save data?

Yep. We’ve all wanted cloud storage for our Switch consoles since launch, so it’s a good thing that the service will provide it. But there remains no other free, offline option to back up save data from the system’s internal storage.

Will all games be able to use the cloud saves feature?

It appears that the answer is no, not every game will work with the cloud. Some games, including the upcoming Pokémon: Let’s Go!, appear not to back up their data to the cloud. Nintendo eShop store pages for Let’s Go!, the Splatoon 2 starter pack, Dark Souls Remastered and Dead Cells all note that that they don’t “support Save Data Cloud backup.”

Why don’t certain games support cloud saves?

In September 2018, Nintendo told Game Informer that the company fears players using their backup saves for unfair reasons. The statement, included below, specifically references Splatoon 2 but should be true for all incompatible games:

The vast majority of Nintendo Switch games will support Save Data Cloud backup. However, in certain games this feature would make it possible to, for example, regain items that had been traded to other players, or revert to a higher online multiplayer ranking that had been lost. To ensure fair play, Save Data Cloud backup may not be enabled for such games. To ensure that Save Data Cloud backups cannot be used to unfairly affect online multiplayer rankings, the feature will not be enabled in Splatoon 2.

If I forget to renew my subscription, what happens to my cloud save?

The Nintendo Switch Online FAQ implies that once a subscription is inactive, cloud saves are lost

Save data stored via the Save Data Cloud backup is available for as long as you have an active Nintendo Switch Online membership. Classic games in the NES – Nintendo Switch Online collection and the save data for those games will not be removed unless the user chooses to do so manually. These items are stored locally on the Nintendo Switch system but cannot be accessed without an active Nintendo Switch Online membership.

Nintendo did not state whether cloud saves would be restored upon renewal or if there is any sort of grace period involved.

So what about the NES games? Which ones are available to play?

The NES games available to Switch Online subscribers come with unique enhancements over the original releases. Each one will support some sort of online multiplayer, including the ability to play cooperatively or competitively with friends. Some NES games will simply let Switch owners share their screen with someone else, or let them “pass the controller” back and forth. It depends on the game.

Nintendo will offer 20 NES games for subscribers once the service is live. Here’s that list of classics:

Balloon Fight

Baseball

Donkey Kong

Double Dragon

Dr. Mario

Excitebike

Ghosts ’n Goblins

Gradius

Ice Climber

Ice Hockey

The Legend of Zelda

Mario Bros.

Pro Wrestling

River City Ransom

Soccer

Super Mario Bros.

Super Mario Bros. 3

Tecmo Bowl

Tennis

Yoshi

Do I have to pay extra to play these games?

Nope. They’re included as part of a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.

Do I get to keep the NES games forever?

Doesn’t sound like it. Nintendo will only let you play these upgraded games so long as you’re a Switch Online subscriber. But you can download them and play them offline.

How much does Nintendo Switch Online cost?

There are several tiers. A 12-month subscription costs $19.99. You can also subscribe for one month for $3.99, or for three months for $7.99.

There’s also a family membership program, which allows a Nintendo Account member to join up with as many as seven other folks to access the Switch Online service. The option to create a family group is now available on the Nintendo Account website, and it appears that you can add anyone to your “family” — whether or not you’re related.

That means that all eight people ostensibly can split the $34.99 cost of the 12-month membership, getting a year’s worth of service for less than $5 per person.

”Any Nintendo Accounts associated with the family membership can use the service, whether they are parent accounts or not,” Nintendo told Polygon about the package. That checks out with the initial details the company provided, below.

Starting May 15, 2018, it will be possible to create a Nintendo Account Family Group via your Nintendo Account settings. Up to eight Nintendo Accounts (including child accounts) can be linked as a family group.

When’s Nintendo Switch Online available?

Nintendo Switch Online will go live on Sept. 18. A weeklong free trial will be available on Nintendo eShop starting the same day.","subscriptionbased

There is never just one reason for a company’s poor stock performance, and in Snap’s case, there are many. Here are some of those:

Snap’s business is growing much slower than expected

Eighteen months ago, analysts projected, on average, that Snap would generate around $540 million in revenue this quarter. Now they’re predicting just $283 million in sales, a dramatic decrease.

Why? Snap admits that it’s been slow to bring lots of advertisers onto the platform. That’s a problem because Snap sells almost all of its ads through an auction process, where ad impressions are sold to the highest bidder. Snap needs more advertisers to increase competition for those auctions: More advertisers means more bidders, which means higher ad prices and more revenue for Snap.

Competition is increasing

There’s no doubt that Instagram, which has successfully copied many of Snap’s best features, is hurting Snap’s growth. In just two years, Instagram’s Snapchat Stories clone has managed to attract more than twice as many users as Snapchat has as a whole.

The impact of competitors may be most evident by looking at the amount of time people spend using Snapchat. A survey published this week by analysts at Cowen Research found that Snapchat users spent less time with the app this quarter than they did a year ago. Users still spend roughly 31 minutes inside the app per day — pretty good — down slightly from 33 minutes in the third quarter of 2017. But Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest all saw time spent increase this quarter over the same time last year.

Snap is losing users

That fierce competition, coupled with other issues, like displeasure around the app’s big redesign earlier this year, led to Snap losing daily active users — 3 million of them — for the first time ever last quarter. That’s a tough issue to overcome just a few years into life as a public company. As we’ve learned from Twitter, jumpstarting user growth once the momentum stops is incredibly hard.

Snap is losing executives

Snap’s executive team has been anything but stable since the company’s IPO in March 2017. Since going public, Snap has lost its CFO, VP of product, VP of sales, VP of engineering and its general counsel.

This past Monday, Imran Khan — the company’s No. 2 exec behind CEO Evan Spiegel — announced he was also leaving.

“We see the exit of both CFO Drew Vallero and CSO Imran Khan as troubling given how early on it is in the business transition,” analysts from investment bank Jefferies wrote this week.

Spiegel controls Snap, and is viewed by many as a product savant, so a lot of investors have kept hope that his product expertise would keep Snapchat going amid other turmoil.

But BTIG’s Rich Greenfield, who downgraded the company to “sell” this week, is no longer buying that argument. “We have said since the IPO that a bet on SNAP was also a bet on Evan Spiegel’s product innovation ability,” he wrote. “We have been disappointed in SNAP’s product evolution (as have users) and see no reason to believe this will change.”

How about some good news?

Not everyone is down on Snap. There was one analyst last week who bumped Snap up to a “buy” rating.

Wedbush’s Michael Pachter thinks that Khan’s departure is actually a sign of good things to come for the company. Specifically, he thinks it will mean more responsibility falls to Snap’s new CFO, Tim Stone, who joined the company from Amazon this summer. Pachter thinks Stone is legit.

“Most investors were not impressed with Imran Khan,” Pachter wrote in an email to Recode. “I think his departure will end up being a net positive, hence the upgrade.”","imran khan” pachter

U.S. President Donald Trump likes to tweet about it, and numerous members of Congress also believe that to be the case.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey — like his counterparts at Facebook and YouTube — has consistently said that his service isn’t biased.

But the people who build Twitter are biased, Dorsey admitted in an interview last month, saying out loud what everyone already knew: Twitter, like most tech companies in Silicon Valley, has a lot more left-leaning employees than right-leaners.

Twitter is so liberal, in fact, that conservative employees “don’t feel safe to express their opinions” within the company, Dorsey told NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen in a new interview published today on Recode Media.

“We have a lot of conservative-leaning folks in the company as well, and to be honest, they don’t feel safe to express their opinions at the company,” Dorsey said. “They do feel silenced by just the general swirl of what they perceive to be the broader percentage of leanings within the company, and I don’t think that’s fair or right.”

Dorsey also explained why he brought up Twitter’s left-leaning employee bias to begin with.

“I think it’s more and more important to at least clarify what our own bias leans towards, and just express it,” he added. “I’d rather know what someone biases to rather than try to interpret through their actions.”

Dorsey’s comments are bound to add fuel to the idea that social platforms like Twitter are suppressing conservative viewpoints, and that Silicon Valley is inherently anti-Trump. It’s a narrative that’s been ongoing for more than two years, and isn’t slowing down. Just this week, far-right news outlet Breitbart published a video of an internal all-hands meeting at Google shortly after the 2016 election in which company executives consoled employees who were upset that Trump won the presidency.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions is even considering a formal investigation to determine whether or not tech giants are indeed suppressing conservative viewpoints.

Twitter, YouTube and Facebook have largely tried to avoid any issues of political bias by relying heavily on software algorithms to determine which content is shown to which users. Software algorithms are written by humans, though, which means they likely have biases as well. Now Dorsey is saying conservative Twitter employees don’t feel comfortable speaking up, which leads to questions about how products at companies like Twitter are made and who has input in making them.

For his part, Dorsey is trying to widen his own feedback loop. Dorsey spoke to Fox News commentator Sean Hannity on his radio show during a recent press blitz and had a number of secret meetings with conservative politicians in Washington this summer to “build ‘trust’ among conservatives who have long chastised the company,” according to the Washington Post.

“We should make sure that everyone feels safe to express themselves within the company, no matter where they come from and what their background is,” Dorsey told Rosen.

Meeker is leading an exodus of late-stage investors from Kleiner Perkins in its most dramatic shake-up since legendary investor John Doerr stepped back from his role more than two years ago. Meeker’s exit — she, along with three of her partners, will form a new firm — will undoubtedly deal a hard blow to Kleiner Perkins, given her high profile in the business community and her stature as by far the most senior woman in venture capital.

Meeker, “the first Wall Street analyst to become a household name” during the dot-com boom, has been most famous in this era for her agenda-setting, unusually thorough “Internet Trends” slide decks, delivered — in memorable, rapid-fire fashion — in recent years at our annual Code Conference. This year’s deck included 294 slides and has been viewed more than a million times; last year’s, with 355 slides, is well past three million views.

The departures of Meeker and her colleagues — Mood Rowghani, Noah Knauf and Juliet de Baubigny — are rooted in different visions for the types of deals they would like to do. But like so many disputes in recent years at Kleiner Perkins, there was also persistent friction between the two sides in ways that had little to do with the firm’s core business — over mundane things such as whether to host a holiday party in San Francisco or closer to Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley — according to people familiar with the situation.

Kleiner Perkins is one of tech’s oldest firms and its early investments in Amazon and Google have made it part of Silicon Valley lore. That legacy has helped sustain the firm even as it self-admittedly missed out on a wave of generation-defining startups. Meeker’s new team will lose the connection to that brand, effectively placing a bet on the singular brand of Meeker.

“The way the teams operate are just very different,” Meeker said in an interview with Recode.

The principals are naturally downplaying how important a split this is, but this is a massive moment for the firm.

“I don’t think it’s a huge deal,” Ted Schlein, who succeeded Doerr as the de facto head of the firm, said in an interview. The late-stage investing group, which started in 2011, “continued to diverge away from what the core part of Kleiner Perkins has done for 46 years, and will continue to do for another 46 years.”

People familiar with the situation described a distant relationship between the early-stage group, which backs U.S. startups that sometimes don’t have a finished product, and the later-stage group, which can compete with sovereign wealth funds to back companies worth billions of dollars all across the world. The two teams spent fairly little time with one another in recent years, sharing office space, some limited partners, and — critically — a storied brand. But deals? Not many.

Lots of top investing firms have two teams that operate semi-independently, and those firms don’t feel the need to go separate ways. But at Kleiner Perkins, there were cultural clashes between the two squads. The firm has long been home to personal squabbles between its big-personality investors — in-fighting that spilled into very public view during the gender discrimination lawsuit brought by Ellen Pao — and it has been unable to put those to rest even as it elevated a new, likable leader in Mamoon Hamid, who joined the firm last year.

Hamid is a bit of a purist for early-stage investing, though Schlein said the decision was not solely his.

What the decision was, according to the people familiar with the situation, was fairly abrupt. While the two sides have been growing apart for years, they had a “moment of clarity” in the last week or so, as one person said, and the two teams quickly moved to go public with their plans for a split before it leaked. The firm’s investors — its limited partners, in industry parlance — were only informed early this morning.

The breaking point came as the team had to decide whether to raise another later-stage fund under the Kleiner banner or under a new one.

The new, still-to-be-named firm led by Meeker will have immediate cachet given Meeker’s connections on Wall Street, where she served as a top research analyst at Morgan Stanley, and in Silicon Valley. Unlike most big-name tech investors, Meeker has name recognition that goes well beyond the sector because of her annual trends report.

“There is only one Mary Meeker,” Schlein said at the time of her hire.

Schlein now says he is “not naive” about what it will be like to lose Meeker. Kleiner Perkins will have to move on without its most famous name. And after the exit of another investor, Beth Seidenberg, in an unrelated departure, it will have no female general partners. Kleiner Perkins plans to take some economic stake in the new firm.

“People have gotten emotional, not in an angry way,” said one of the people, “but in a poignant way.”","kleiner perkins caufield byers

A year after Jeff Bezos asked for suggestions on how he should use his money for good, the world’s wealthiest person announced that he would dedicate at least $2 billion to philanthropic projects, with a focus on combating homelessness and supporting preschool education (including schools where “the child is the customer.”) Called the Bezos Day One Fund, the project is a long time coming for the Amazon CEO, who had yet to spend any real amount of his $163 billion in assets on charity, despite external pressure. But don’t expect this announcement to put a pause to questions about how Bezos spends his fortune and how to understand his legacy. [Theodore Schleifer / Recode]

Now Dorsey is trying to make Twitter better, and he wants your help.

And if you’re very lucky, he’ll spend an hour talking to you, asking you what you like about the service, what you’d like to change about it, and telling you what he thinks.

That’s what happened this week when Dorsey sat down for an hour with Jay Rosen, a Twitter power user who is also a professor of journalism at New York University. Rosen recorded the conversation on his iPhone (5!), and you can listen to it now, on a special episode of Recode Media with Peter Kafka. We’ve also included a transcript of their conversation below.

Dorsey has done a lot of talking over the past few weeks, and if you are a Dorsey completist you may recognize components of this discussion from other interviews. But this is more of a conversation than a conventional Q&A, and if you have deep interest in the way Dorsey thinks about his powerful/fraught platform/messaging service (don’t call it a microblog!) you’ll get a lot out of this.

For instance, he’s clearly interested in the idea of letting users tell the world that they’re actively on the service, in real time, a notion he has noticed bubbling up from Black Twitter. And while he’s very interested in presenting different slices of Twitter to different users, he’s also adamantly opposed to closing off subsets of the service to specific groups, like Facebook is encouraging its users to do.

Pro tip: If you’d like to spend an hour talking to Jack Dorsey about Twitter, one way to go about it is to tweet about Dorsey’s conversations about Twitter, after spending years building a following as a thoughtful observer of journalism, media and technology.

That’s what Rosen did last month, which led to this response from Dorsey:

Happy to talk with you more about this Jay — jack (@jack) August 21, 2018

Which led to the conversation below.

You can find more of Jay Rosen’s work at his blog PressThink and on Twitter; you can also listen to him on two other episodes of Recode Media. Special thinks to Ben Brandstein at NYU for his audio production help with this recording.

You can listen to Recode Media wherever you get your podcasts — including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.

Below, we’ve shared a full transcript of Jay’s conversation with Jack.

Jack Dorsey: You’re sticking with the [iPhone] 5?

Jay Rosen: Yeah. I don’t like to change much, and that’s not so great for technology.

Yeah.

I’m one of those users who always screams when you change something, and then half the time I hate it, and half the time I get to like it.

What did you think of the 280?

Exactly that. At first, I said, “I’m not gonna do this. I’m gonna voluntarily stick to 140,” because I thought that was a great constraint and I thought it was unwise to change it. But now, it became a little ridiculous to hold out because everybody else was using 280 when they needed to. So now I’m comfortable with it. It didn’t actually create any huge problems.

Yeah. Well, we found that when people are just tweeting more as a broadcast, it on average tends to stay below 140.

Yeah, that’s very interesting.

Which has been great, but where it’s really been helpful is when people have a conversation. So, replies do go above 140 and allows a little bit more nuance and a little bit more space to have a discussion and discourse.

Yeah. It’s actually been very successful for me in that sense because I often have views that need qualification, and knowing Twitter the way I do and the kinds of reactions that you sometimes get, if what you’re saying sounds like something people have heard before, they react to that. In order to say, “I’m not saying this. I am saying that,” 280 actually makes a big difference.

Yeah.

What has been ... I have several questions I wanted to ask you. What has been your experience in your listening tour, especially with conservatives? What have you learned?

Well, first and foremost, at least I personally have not tended to have conversations with many people in a more conservative end of the spectrum or right end of the spectrum, so goal number one was to say that we’re here, be present, and see the folks who I personally haven’t talked to, and as an organization, we tend not to naturally lean towards, and I don’t know if there are any fundamentally different learnings that are different from the conversations that we have with folks who are more on the left end of the spectrum, more of the liberal end of the spectrum or libertarian end of the spectrum, wherever that lies.

So, there’s a lot of questions as to how — well, why we make decisions the way we make them, how the algorithms work, a lot of questions around timeline ranking, and that changed three years ago. It was the first time we really applied machine learning to where people spent the majority of their time within the service, and some confusion about that. I think there was a question as to why there haven’t been a lot of conversations with people on the more conservative end of the spectrum in the past. There was a desire to have more. There’s a desire to be able to have an open feedback channel, and I don’t know, always good conversations. We had some folks from the media in every one of these. We had some folks in politics, some folks in academia, some technology folks, and pretty good.

Mm-hmm. You say they’re similar to conversations, people on the left side of the spectrum, but people on the left side of the spectrum aren’t accusing Twitter of shadow banning their voices, are they?

The people we talked to didn’t really accuse us of shadow banning their voices.

They didn’t? They didn’t accuse you of bias against conservatives?

They asked questions as to whether a bias within the company would translate into the service and into actions, but it was all questions rooted in, “I follow this person. Why am I not seeing their tweets in my timeline?” The majority of the questions I got about shadow banning and bias were either on Twitter or within the Congressional hearing.

So, public performances, where there was some external audience to perform for. Yeah. Why did you go public with this generalization that people in Twitter are generally liberal or lean left, and that’s our culture, which I have no trouble believing is true, but why did you start talking about that?

I think it’s more and more important to at least clarify what our own bias leans towards, and just express it. I’d rather know what someone biases to rather than try to interpret through their actions. So, if we can say that, and also have the freedom to evolve and change, then at least people know it, and I think it allows us to remove that a little bit more from the work, but it has to be proven out in our actions as well, so ... I mean, we have a lot of conservative-leaning folks in the company as well, and to be honest, they don’t feel safe to express their opinions at the company.

They do feel silenced by just the general swirl of what they perceive to be the broader percentage of leanings within the company, and I don’t think that’s fair or right. We should make sure that everyone feels safe to express themselves within the company, no matter where they come from and what their background is. I mean, my dad was a Republican. When I was growing up, was on the radio all the time with Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, so my mom was on the opposite end of the spectrum and ...

Right. I read about that in another interview you did. Yeah.

Yeah, and I appreciate that, and I always felt safe to challenge both of them, especially my dad, and so it was definitely a privilege, but if we’re creating a culture that doesn’t enable people or empower people to speak up or not, we’re gonna be able to do that for our service.

I’m of two minds on that. On the one hand, it’s absolutely true that if you don’t feel safe in speaking out, then in effect, you don’t have free speech. I think that’s true, and that’s a tremendously important thing for a company like Twitter, but it’s also true that public life and participating in public debate involves risk. The most basic risk is that someone will criticize you, and do you ever feel like saying to your conservative employees, “Look. Speak up. You might get criticized, but you have to have the courage to do that. We’re not gonna penalize you, but you are, to some degree, when you speak up in public or in a public culture of a company, you are, yes, vulnerable to criticism, vulnerable to reaction. That’s part of public life. That’s part of being a mature citizen?” Do you ever say that back to them?

I mean, yeah. It’s easier said than done. I know this for myself. I was a kid that was very shy. I grew up with a speech impediment. It taught me not to speak at all, and I eventually got over that, and speaking up in a collection of 3,000 people where you make an assumption that they potentially think differently than you or believe differently is hard. It does require sacrificing a lot of your ego and your intellect in being vulnerable for a minute.

What are the best bridges to enable people to do that? I don’t know if entering into a political debate is always the right first step, but maybe. But yeah, I definitely encourage speaking up and having the courage to do so, but one has to feel it maybe in a different context before they get more of that, and I think it just takes time. But we have people who will be courageous and speak up, but I don’t know. It’s hard to do as any individual.

When I interviewed Adam Sharp, who at the time was the head of news for Twitter, he said something very interesting to me, which was that we may, from the outside, underestimate how passionate people on Twitter are about news, how much they love news and how obsessed they are with the news. Is that true? Is that part of the culture at the company? Where does that come from?

Oh, what do you mean? In terms of us being obsessed with news?

Yeah, the people who work there are lovers of news. They are obsessed with it. They follow it, obviously. They contribute to it through the company, the platform, and they are especially tuned to the problems in the news system. That’s what he was saying.

Yeah. I think so. I mean, when we started the company, we built something that we wanted to use, and more and more, people taught us what they wanted to use it for, and then what they wanted to use it for was to see what’s happening, which was ...

News.

... news and newsworthy, and whether it be a conversation between two people as being newsworthy to someone, or actual breaking news that is more global of nature, it is certainly now in our DNA, but I do think it’s a byproduct of what our real fundamental is, which is public conversation. Entertainment is a byproduct of that. If we lose sight of the fundamental that we’re serving, which is enabling people to converse in public and discuss in public ...

Why do you see that as more fundamental than news? Because I don’t see it that way.

Because we never know what is going to be newsworthy or not, and oftentimes we’ve seen simple conversations turn into something really meaningful. The most prominent that’s top of mind immediately in this moment is there was an IT professional in Pakistan who was tweeting at 3:40 in the morning about helicopters over his apartment, and five hours later, we learned that that was the raid on Osama bin Laden.

Bin Laden. I remember that. Yep.

If we purely focus on news as just the fundamental atomic unit, I think we become dependent upon news sources rather than seeing potentially everything as newsworthy to someone, and I also think if we were to focus entirely just on news as the atomic unit, we wouldn’t see as much discussion and debate and dialogue around what’s happening as well. So, it’s not that I don’t think Twitter is about news and people don’t use it to see what’s happening and get their news, but there’s gotta be something that feeds that, and to me it’s that public conversation aspect.

See, I see it almost as the reverse. When I say news, though, I don’t mean the news industry or the major providers of news.

Anything new or noteworthy.

Yeah. I mean news in the more fundamental sense of “what’s happening?” It could be what’s happening in my life. It could be what’s happening in my neighborhood. It could be what’s happening in the world, what happened today in Congressional hearings. And the way I look at Twitter is that it’s a part of the news system. It’s a fundamental part of the news system. It’s become part of the infrastructure of the news system, which is why anybody who pays attention to the news closely knows that news usually breaks on Twitter.

Very often, the first notice you have of it is on Twitter, and I first became aware of that with the plane crash in the Hudson, where I kind of knew it as an abstract thing, but seeing it happen, especially because I live in New York and I wasn’t that far from the event itself, and so Twitter is fundamentally ... It’s part of the news system. You go there to find out what’s happening, and what people naturally do, what they need to do to have a healthy democracy is, of course, discuss the news, and so I see them as complementary ...

Oh, absolutely.

... and equally fundamental.

And they cycle. Sometimes those discussions become what’s happening and become news as well. And to your point around ... Twitter was described in the past, I’m not sure who said it, as where the news gets its news.

Yeah, that’s true, too. Yeah.

I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that people do feel free to discuss what’s happening. What I appreciate about Twitter is, unlike in Instagram, it doesn’t feel like a post. It feels like the start of a — it feels like a message.

So, you want to increase that sense of flow rather than posting, right?

Fluidity. Yeah. We don’t want to post and then stop. One of the descriptions and labels that we had in the past, which I always despised, was microblogging, because you ...

Yeah. I remember that.

It encourages behavior of post, comment, comment, comment, and it just feels such to be a dead end versus message, message, message, message, which is just as fluid reply, and it could go anywhere, and I think that speaks to the fact that we don’t have a social graph. We have a graph around interest. We have people following you not because of the fact that you’re in their address book, but because they’re interested in what you have to say, and the spectrum of what you have to say changes over time, and that fluidity is really important and isn’t really captured in, “I’m composing a post.” It’s like, “this is what I think right now, and this is what I think right now, and let me clarify, and let me clarify, and this is what I think right now.”

Yeah. I use it that way, and I try to benefit from that feature of Twitter and the thread mechanism, which ...

Has that been helpful?

Yeah. I like the fact that it started as a user convention, and then ...

Everything on Twitter.

Yeah, everything starts that way. Right.

The @ symbol, the hashtag, the retweet.

Totally. I enjoy that part of Twitter, and I like the thread because it’s a form of writing that is very demanding. So, for me, it is what you say. It’s intended to be part of conversation. It lends itself to conversation. I can always add to my thread if I want to, which is really interesting. I could actually come back three weeks later and add something to it if I want to, but because of the risks that anybody with a public platform on Twitter has whenever they post — meaning if I say something stupid, it could create a viral attack on me, if it’s really out of bounds. I’m always aware of that. And so even though it’s supposed to be a flow and supposed to be a natural conversation, that’s an artifice for me because I have to think super carefully about everything I post.

How do we fix that? How do we allow more space for verification?

An edit button would be one. I know that’s hard. I know there’s all kinds of issues, but that’s ...

It’s not that it’s hard. It’s that if you asked a hundred different people what they intend by “edit,” you’ll get a hundred different answers.

Well, I just mean fixing mistakes within a few minutes.

Within a five-minute window?

Yeah, within a few minutes of something that you post.

What about longer? But that doesn’t address the clarification issue. You may tweet something stupid and not realize it after an uproar or outrage for a day.

Yeah. Well, there, I don’t know how hard this is from an engineering point of view, but it would be interesting and I would use it if I could clarify something that I posted.

Do you ever do that with your own tweets through quote-tweet?

I do. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I correct things that way.

Does that work?

It does, except that very often the follow-up doesn’t spread the way that the original did. So I can use it that way, but somehow, to indicate that something that is spreading has a further explanation to it or qualification, I would probably use that, even though it’s only a handful of times when I need it.

You need it.

But when I need it, I need it a lot.

Yeah.

But as I said, for me, I don’t really mind having to think through what I say, because I’m a college professor. I’m supposed to be careful and precise, and actually, I consider it a good discipline, the fact that one wrong tweet could blow up your life, which is a fact. It’s happened to many people. It does make it risky. It means never tweet drunk, all these basic things, but it’s also a very good discipline for me as a writer. I like it.

Yeah.

Let me ask you about something else. When I read through your testimony, which was a series of tweets, and some of the interviews ...

Which one?

The one that you did recently.

No, I did two hearings, and there are two different series of tweets. Those were just the openings, but they were different. One was focused on election interference and then the other was focused on bias.

I think it was the second one.

Congress.

I felt like there’s a tension in what you’re trying to do. The tension is, on the one hand you’re saying, “We are impartial. We’re an impartial platform. When we write our rules, when we enforce our rules, we’re not trying to discriminate against this group or that group. Even though we, as individuals at Twitter and as a company with a culture, do lean this way.” Right there, those are two different motions. One is impartial, we are neutral, we’re objective.

Not neutral.

Okay. You didn’t use the word neutral. You don’t want the word neutral.

No.

All right. That’s good. I wanted to figure that out. All right. I’ll ask you about that in a second. So, “We’re impartial, but we’re not saying that we don’t have any points of view, or that we don’t have our own culture. We do.”

Correct.

Okay. That’s one system. Another system that seemed to be coming through in that tweet thread is, “We are a company that contributes to the public square and to conversation in the public sphere.”

That’s how we’re used.

That’s how we’re used. Okay.

We believe that many people see us as a public square and use us as a public square. I don’t have expectations accordingly. They expect, because we’re used as a public square, they expect to have the same sort of, well, they have the same sort of expectations they would have of a public square, like Bryant Park.

Okay. So my question is, why aren’t the values of Twitter what it takes to have a healthy public sphere?

I guess it depends on what you mean by value. We value health in dialogue so that is our singular objective right now, is to increase the health of how people participate in our public square. I think it does benefit to get into neutrality versus impression.

Yeah, let’s do that.

A lot of people have asked us, “Are you a public utility?” and, “Are you a neutral communications platform?”

Like the electric company or something like that.

Or AT&T. Neutral communications platform, presumably, you pick up the phone, you call your friend, you call your father, you call your mother.

Right. It doesn’t care who you’re calling or what you’re using.

Presumably, they do not care about the content whatsoever because the other person picked up the phone — or multiple, you have a group conference call, they all decided to participate in that thing. And they should be completely neutral to whatever happens on that pipe and through that pipe. And a lot of people have taken that neutrality and then said, “Well, we should also be that because we are like the internet.”

Yeah, pipes.

Pipes. But we, upon further reflection, we are being used more like what you would find in Washington Square Park. You walk into Washington Square Park and there’s a bunch of people who, when I walk in, there’s a bunch of people there who are not expecting me to walk in and aren’t expecting me to do the things that I intend to do and might see it out of the corner of their eye and might come over and listen or interact or whatnot. In that public square, there’s all these things that happen and some are amazing, and some are stupid, and some are silly, and some are really terrible. There’s a guy in the corner with a megaphone broadcasting his thoughts and then he recognizes you and he says, “Jay, get the hell over here. You’re a terrible person and I hate you,” and all these other things. And it’s completely directed at you.

And at that point, people recognize it and they tell him to stop, or the park stewards or police come over and say, “Here’s a warning and if you keep attacking this one person who doesn’t want it and is not even paying attention to you, then you’re out.” So that action right there was not neutrality, it was being impartial to the conduct and with an eye towards more of the collective, with an eye towards like, “We need to make Washington Square Park something that people actually want to be at and recognize that there’s going to be people who choose unhealthy behaviors and we’re going to at least demonstrate what is not healthy and what could be healthier.”

I do believe health is a value that we’ve chosen to make a singular objective, and we value health in public conversation, but in order to do it correctly, we need to do it with a principle of impartiality, which means that we’re not going to do on the basis of bias or prejudice or favoring one account over another for improper reasons. Where we have failed in that is to be transparent around how we write our rules and how we enforce them.

And where we’ve also failed in the past is being open with our mistakes and then correcting them. Because we’re not always going to see outcomes of impartiality even though that is our intent. We will see outcomes that are not impartial and that may favor one account over another or inject bias, whether it be through the training set that was used to train our algorithm or a human operator that had to make a judgment call and made it incorrectly.

So I think it’s really important we clarify, we do value health in this thing that people see as a public square. We are going to make it our objective to increase the collective health. We realize not everyone is going to choose health in the short term, but we want to demonstrate by choosing healthy conduct. We can further amplify your reach, but if you don’t, it’s only your earned audience and if you’re harassing people, then we’re going to ask you to leave.

What do you think this principle of health that you just articulated replaces in your old thinking, if this is the new thinking? What did you have in that place before?

I think we were just addressing this in terms of what we’re seeing on the surface.

Just going from problem to problem without really having a coherent point of view?

A coherent, cohesive framework to link them altogether?

Yeah.

We saw abuse, we went after abuse. We saw misinformation, we went a little bit after that.

Right. It’s fighting fires.

But they’re all tied together. This is what the Cortico folks and Deb Roy asked us about a year-and-a-half ago now, which is like, “What if you can measure health of conversation?” I said, “How would you do that?” He said, “Well, first you need to figure out what the indicators of health are.” I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Well, your body has an indicator of health and system imbalance which is your temperature, 98.6 means more or less your system’s in balance. If it’s above or below then something’s out of whack and something’s out of balance.”

We recognize that’s an indicator of health, but we also need to measure it so we needed to invent thermometers to measure it. Then we get a metric out and then we can see how that metric trends over time. And as we deploy solutions like hot water with lemon or when you take wine, what happens with that trend? Then based on those experiences, we can say that, “If you want to be healthy, then you drink more hot water with lemon and less wine during that time of imbalance.”

So he came up with four, which are shared attention — and implicit in all these indicators is that more of them is healthier. Shared attention, like what percentage of the conversation is focused on the same things rather than disparate things. Shared reality, which is what percentage of conversation is sharing the same facts, not that they’re true or not, but this percentage of the conversation or accounts or people believe the world is round and this percentage believe it’s flat. The implied assumption there is that the more of us that are sharing the same facts, the healthier the conversation will be.

Yeah, but the world is round.

Yes, and the predominant percentage believes that that is factual. There are other people who share different facts. And that’s just one crazy but illustrative example.

That’s a rabbit hole there.

It’s just an example, but there are ... religion. And I believe this fact to be fact and I believe this to be factual and those aren’t necessarily shared. And then the third one being receptivity. Participants, are they receptive or are they creating toxic action? And then fourth and finally is variety of perspective. Are we feeding a filter bubble or echo chamber or are we actually seeing divergent — it’s not diverse, but divergent abuse.

That’s the beginning of the direction that I would like to see you go in. It’s fundamentally compatible with what you’re saying. But the way I would say it is, Twitter contributes to, is part of, wants to be a key part of a healthy public sphere.

Which we’ve committed to.

Okay, you committed to that already. And, in order to have a healthy public sphere, certain things have to be true, certain things have to be had.

Or increased.

Yes. And we are continually in the process of learning what the requirements of a healthy public sphere are. We know what some of them are and we are designing our systems and enforcing our rules accordingly. And we are continually learning what it really takes to have a healthy public sphere in a global connected society and a platform that reaches everywhere in the world. And therefore, we don’t want to apologize for changing our policies or evolving them because nobody knows everything about this problem.

And furthermore, because we’re always learning, we have to learn in a very public way and therefore we are committed to, yes, transparency as an abstraction, but in practice, it means we have to share a lot more data. We have to share our thinking. We have to share the kind of criticism we’re getting and we may have to build systems to get better criticism. That’s the way I would state it.

And that is — it’s important because it means that you’re not saying anything goes, you’re not saying you’re indifferent to what happens on the platform. You’re saying, “We are standing up for these values and we’re continually learning what they require of us and if you violate the requirements of a healthy public sphere, we will take action against you.”

And one of the things that obviously you have to recognize — and I’m sure you’re recognizing it more and more — is that there are bad actors who don’t actually want there to be a healthy public sphere. They want it to be distorted. They want it to break down. They even might want to destroy the institutions of a public sphere because, in the wreckage of those institutions, a lot of energy is released, a lot of fury, controversy. And you can power a political movement with them.

I agree with all that. Did you read my health thread?

I think I did.

Because we said, we committed to all the things you said.

I know you committed to it, right.

But it is, like we do say a lot and we need to prove it through the work, but ultimately ... and we’ll have updates to that, obviously, as well. But we believe those health indicators shouldn’t be owned by us. They should be designed and defined by a third party. We should publish to them and we should be held accountable to them.

Third party meaning ...

Third party being like Cortico, MIT, social apps. For example, the researchers that we’re working with through our feed process to define what these indicators are. I don’t know, but we recognize we’re not the only ones serving a public square, a public conversation, that there are multiple folks including journalists and publications like the New York Times and the National Review or whoever. And maybe they could also utilize these indicators to determine health of the discussion around their work, or even measure the efficacy of their work as a contribution, as an impact to the public conversation.

What about having public editor or public editors, plural.

Internally?

No, like a Margaret Sullivan, somebody who’s empowered to listen to complaints that users are having, get answers from the company. They are not beholden to the company, but they are like ombudsmen. And that’s a way of showing that there’s somebody that you can talk to when you think something is amiss and they push for more transparency. They push for answers on behalf of the users.

I like the idea of it.

Yeah. Who is empowered to work on behalf of the users at Twitter? Everybody?

Everyone, in terms of direct, the most direct contribution, it’s engineers and product and design folks. We have a research team that is constantly having conversations with people all around the world that use our service and people who don’t use it, asking them why. We’re about to hire a social scientist as well to help us understand more of our impact, not within the service alone, but also off platform.

This is another dimension that we’re adding is, the ramifications of what people do on Twitter and how they translate off, and vice versa. So it really depends on what you mean, but we are most frontline, to actual people that we serve, is our research team, our customer support team and our sales team. They offer conversations on the databases, live.

I guess what I meant is, I see people sometimes explode in frustration, and I’m sure you’ve seen this too. They say, “Hey, @Jack, would you fix ...” and they’re trying to talk to the top of the company, which isn’t really a very practical way of getting their concerns registered and acted upon. So you need a system for that, that’s immediate flare-ups.

Then it seems to me you have another listening project, which would be medium-term, things like, “How’s the 280 going?” that’s a medium-term concern. And then you have these longer-term issues like the ones you’re talking about, of how do people follow conversation, how do we make the platform more topic-focused, things like that. But I don’t know who, if I have something I think is wrong with Twitter, I don’t know where to go and I’m a pretty experienced user.

Yeah, tweeting it, usually. The amount of tweets we send internally as, “Look at what people are saying about this,” or this feature, or, “This is really topical,” or, “This is a fair critique,” is pretty immense. Our leadership team alone, we’ve have a private DM that we coordinate almost everything that we do around, and we’re constantly sending tweets that we find that are critiques of us or ... like there was a really good critique sent yesterday around the rank timeline and how Sarah ... I forget how to pronounce her last name ...

Kendzior, from St. Louis?

Same as I’m from.

Yeah, you’re from there, right.

She sent a tweet about, she turns the switch off, the ranked timeline ...

I saw that.

... and she saw a bunch of things from people that she hadn’t heard from in weeks. So we passed that around and we need to look into why that was happening because that’s not the intention of the ranking. It should be focused on like, “If this person is extremely relevant within the moment and relevant to the viewer, it should be at the top of the timeline.” So these are all signals that we use.

So who’s responsible for explaining that?

Our engineering team ultimately designing the home timeline experience and the algorithms behind it.

But who’s in charge of explaining it to users?

It really depends. I would like more of our employees to be more conversational on our service on a regular basis. I want to be a really open company where we’re just having conversations nonstop about our work. We tried another set with this when we were ... we’d been playing with the idea of what presence means on Twitter and also playing with threading on Twitter as well, both with the desire to incentivize more conversation and, ultimately, healthier conversation.

So if, you know, people get a lot ... like Zeynep is someone who says like, “Twitter’s all about conversation,” and like, “The amount of work I have to do to follow replies and understand who’s replying to what and this tweet goes here and this tweet goes here is ridiculous. You’re taking a bunch of time away from me.” So it’s really under that initiative of like, “Let’s better organize how people are utilizing this so that we make Twitter feel more conversational.”

What does presence have to do with it? Why do you use the term “presence?”

Presence is like, it’s, you know, it’s basically, “I’m online, I’m here.” There’s been a really amazing, kind of organic thing that’s come out of Black Twitter, which is #onhere, to describe just experiences that are happening right now or contextualize the experiences happening on Twitter itself. We’ve been playing internally, and we shared some screenshots of what if — of course if you give permission — what if you see a green dot next to my name? Seeing that, like ...

That means that I’m on ...

I’m active on Twitter right now and you could reach out and talk with me right now or tweet at me right now. Or if you tweet, I might be more likely to see it, but just that sense of like —

I might use that. Yeah, I might use that sometimes.

Like, it’s who’s up.

Yeah. Who’s up and who’s open to being communicated with.

Yeah. It kind of goes back to our early days of like, a lot of Twitter came from like the AOL Instant Messenger status and just extracting that into an entire product. But the thing that we lost was the “available” signal.

Right.

It’s interesting, the other thing that we’re noticing is that ...

Which is, messaging systems have that.

Yeah.

Yeah.

The other thing we’re noticing is that, I don’t know if you’ve noticed this, but we have the @ name and then we have the display name.

Yes.

And people have been changing their display name because we increased the size.

Yeah, I saw that.

They do it for a lot of reasons. We see a lot of “resist” in it, we see Xs.

I would never do that. I noticed that. I would never in a zillion years do that.

A lot of people who think we’re shadow banning them put an X in it, and you see all sorts of things. But what’s really interesting is people have started to put their status in it, like “Jack in NYC” or “NYC Jack” and that’s another, it’s another opportunity. People are using this thing that wasn’t designed for it, but they’re telling us that they want to have some omnipresent status independent of the tweets that might be more ephemeral. So it’s just interesting to look at these organic behaviors that emerge and whether they should be live features. But a lot of people have been utilizing this #onhere of like, “I’m up.”

Right.

Like, “Who’s around?”

Right.

Black Twitter is extremely conversational and very much used like we are a text messaging app but the whole world can join in. I just think that’s so fascinating. That is why I say like news and entertainment are byproducts of conversation, and vice versa. Sometimes something is happening in the world and I see it outside, like a plane landing in the Hudson, and I have a conversation about it and sometimes I have a conversation, and that becomes the news.

Yeah, I think it works both ways.

Yeah, and they feed each other.

Right. And I think, conversation, when it’s good, also can cause people to look for news.

Yeah. Yeah. That’s a good point.

Which is really important.

That’s a good point.

I want to ask you about one other thing and then any questions you have for me, I’d be happy to answer. It would seem to me, if I were a CEO of Twitter, that the nightmare scenario for me, as a executive, would be something like what’s been happening in Myanmar and other places where false information gets communicated over a public platform and it leads to essentially genocide or attacks on people. You don’t necessarily know it because it’s really hard to keep track of everything that’s happening on a global platform. Does that keep you up at night? How do you handle the very real possibility that your machine could be involved in something like that?

It definitely keeps me up, and something I’ve been reflecting a lot more on, in terms of just in the context of the hearings and the election interference. Like what I think is happening is much bigger than through elections. There are, as you said, bad-faith actors who have an agenda to distract and divide and to confuse. The election just happened to be a hook.

Yeah, and they may not be evenly distributed across the political spectrum.

Absolutely, or ...

Bad-faith actors, they may not be.

Or they may not be on the spectrum at all.

Yeah.

They may not be on the spectrum at all other than having an agenda just to ...

To destroy public conversation.

To divide.

Yeah. To divide.

To divide.

And to, yeah, and to polarize.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And just to cause a number of issues that distract us from what we really need to focus on. The organizing principles of the past are not going to serve us in the same way that we need to organize to face the challenges that are present today. Like the existential crises before us of economic inequality and the growing wealth gap, especially a racial wealth gap, the environment, and the displacement of work from artificial intelligence, those are things that an organizing principle of a nation state will not be able to solve because they’re global and they face all of us.

So on the positive, I believe this is where the internet can really shine, is that we have a global organizing principle, and it is the internet, and we have an ability to build layers, like Twitter, that ours is focused on conversation, conversational layer of the internet and wanted to make it accessible to everyone. Some people will utilize that for extremely negative things and continue to look for opportunities to game us. We’re never going to build a perfect antidote to that. We have to stay 10 steps ahead constantly. That means we need to be a lot more aware of how people are using the system and how people are intending to game it, and act faster.

I think the one advantage that we have against our peers is the fact that it is just completely open and completely fluid and completely public. I think when you have a join button or a subscribe button into a small community or a close community, you develop a lot of these really isolated sort of bubbles, where things can really fester quite quickly, and it’s also hard to see what’s going on inside. But more important ... and that becomes a real issue when you have to be a small company that’s trying to see as much as possible. But if everything is out in the open, then everyone in the world ...

I see what you mean by an advantage, yeah.

... can see it and call it out and at least raise the issue so that we can identify it much faster.

Yeah.

So I do think we have an advantage of everything being on the surface and I would hate to lose that. So that is not something that I rest on because we have definitely been gamed, and we have definitely been utilized to manipulate people. I think that intention will only grow. I think people continue to find new ways of like we saw the Russian government during 2016. We just disclosed evidence of folks in Iran taking on similar patterns and I’m certain it’ll continue to happen within the borders of this country and countries around the world. But this is where the organizing principle of a nation state doesn’t work because these are going to be global issues and require global solutions. We need to prioritize those global solutions first.

One point to recognize about that, Jack, is that if it’s true that nation states won’t be able to solve these problems, but we have the internet, which is global and does have the scale … that means that the companies that own that global scale become very much like a world government. That’s a problem because they don’t have the same accountability that elected governments have. So that, that is a huge issue.

Yuval’s new book “21 Lessons,” I’m halfway through right now, but he’s exploring a lot of these, especially like do we need a need a global world government? His answer is no. What we need is, and I might be getting this wrong because I’m halfway through the chapter, but what we need is a lot more of this kind of open communication around how these things interact, but also that the nation states prioritize, and even local governments like New York City prioritize global concerns over the local concerns.

Take the environment as an example. What are we doing to reduce our own impact on the environment? So I do believe that a lot of these services, and ours, there’s a growing concern of the power that we have over this public square that we’re serving and there’s a natural distrust of it and a natural fear of it because people fear losing their voice. People fear losing their ability to participate. People fear losing their job.

Yeah.

Because they hear “Twitter” and then they hear, they go in the timeline and they hear “algorithm,” and algorithm is displacement of work, and then five years down the line, where am I? I don’t think we’ve done enough to address some of those fears. I think the only way we can do it is more openness and more transparency.

Well, on that point, one of the things that I would really love to see Silicon Valley, you and your peers turn to, is innovation on these kinds of questions. Innovation in public explanation, innovation in transparency ...

Or terms of service.

Innovation in terms of service, perfect example. Terms of service are completely opaque, nobody knows what they’re signing up for. That requires innovation. It’s not technology, right? It’s practice.

Policies.

Innovation in listening, innovation in public criticism and feedback. It’s amazing to me that in Silicon Valley all these people who see themselves as disruptors and innovators when it comes to, for example, explaining the company, they act like the same old PR merchants from the 1950s, like absolutely zero innovation, and nobody thinks that’s a contradiction at all. I do. So I would like to see a lot more innovation in public communication and explanation because without it, as you become these global forces, if you don’t have global accountability, you’re in for a lot of trouble.

I agree.

What questions do you have for me, if any, as a user since 2008?

If you could point to one positive impact of our work and one negative impact of our work, what would rise to the top in each?

Well for me, as a journalism professor, the most positive thing about Twitter is it allows me to practice journalism school extension, which means not just teaching the people who come to NYU and can afford the tuition and show up in my classes, but anyone who is interested and allowing me to develop a constituency for my ideas, that includes journalists for sure, but also lots of people who are concerned about the quality of journalism, and to do so without gatekeepers in a way that allows me to control my own message, has been amazing.

The bad thing is the same thing that people much more vulnerable than I am complain about, which is that anybody can walk over to me in Washington Square Park and scream how much they hate me at me and to reply to them would actually bring more of that upon me. So this sort of the openness to attack ...

And the velocity.

... and the velocity of it and the scale of it sometimes. Like when a big account decides that it’s going to unload on something that I said, usually in criticism of me being part of a “liberal media,” which I’m not but they think I am, that which again, I only experience a fraction of it compared to other people who are much more vulnerable than I am, and I’m a privileged character. I have a blue check next to my name, I have tenure at NYU, so I have all these protections, but that would be the thing that dissatisfies me the most. Along with some opacity in some of the changes that you introduced. That really bothers me. Like what is the algorithm doing to my feed? I don’t actually know. I don’t know where to go to find out.

Well, that’s another fascinating area of research as well. The algorithm doesn’t know either, sometimes.

Yes, exactly.

There’s this research field in AI around explainability, and the intention is to encourage more functionality that allows, especially deep-learning algorithms, to explain the criteria, the decision-making criteria they’re using, because right now they can’t.

That’s a big issue. Big problem.

So if you don’t know why a decision is being made by an algorithm ...

Then you literally don’t know what you’re doing.

... and we’re moving more and more of our decisions through it. Like I’m wearing an Apple Watch, it tells me to stand every now and then. I have offloaded a decision around my physical health to this thing, and if it can’t tell me why it’s making that particular point, I know that it happens 10 minutes to the top of the hour, but that may change over time and that may impact something in a fundamental way that I can’t predict.

It’s like the new frontier is in opacity.

Theodore Schleifer,"Would Jeff Bezos be so generous if he was not under such profound scrunity? That scrutiny is not going to end for the world’s wealthiest person, who on Thursday announced he would dedicate at least $2 billion to philanthropic projects. It’s a long time coming… [+2728 chars]",Don’t expect this announcement to put a pause to questions about how he spends his fortune and how to understand his legacy.,2018-09-13T20:22:31Z,recode,$2 billion in charity is not enough for Jeff Bezos to slink out of the public limelight,https://www.recode.net/2018/9/13/17855950/jeff-bezos-donation-2-billion-philanthropy-charity-amazon-ceo,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1GrvxA2NyDdq8INIZOWu8RwLcd4=/0x0:4344x2274/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13056347/997234336.jpg.jpg,technology,2018-09-16 14:23:31.214622,"Would Jeff Bezos be so generous if he was not under such profound scrutiny?

That scrutiny is not going to end for the world’s wealthiest person, who on Thursday announced he would dedicate at least $2 billion to philanthropic projects. It’s a long time coming for the Amazon CEO, who had yet to spend any real amount of his $163 billion in assets on charity, despite external pressure.

Bezos made the declaration as an important deadline approached: He said in June that he would unveil his giving plans this summer — which officially ends next week. That’s relevant, not pedantic, since Bezos’s giving plans have at least had the perception of being PR-motivated. He first tweeted about his interest in philanthropy on the cusp of questions from the New York Times about his parsimonious donation history.

Even now, though, Bezos’s $2 billion is a meager amount of money relative to the giving plans of other billionaires. He is commiting about 1.3 percent of his total net worth during a year in which his pocketbook doubled in size thanks to Amazon’s bull run, according to Forbes. Bezos has not signed The Giving Pledge — the promise by billionaires to donate a majority of their wealth to charity — as have the world’s other wealthiest people, such as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg.

Bezos’s contributions will focus on combating homelessness and supporting preschool education. He also said in his statement that his family’s contributions to the fund “will begin with a commitment of $2 billion,” suggesting that he is likely to give more.

The Amazon founder has made some gifts: $15 million to Princeton University, where he went to college, and tens of millions of dollars to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. (Those are still drops in the bucket when you consider just how wealthy he is.)

Bezos has helped reinvigorate journalism by purchasing the Washington Post and has described his investment in his space-exploration company, Blue Origin, in philanthropic terms (though both of those are for-profit entities). And he turned heads in the political world this summer when he unveiled a $10 million contribution — a pittance in tech, but a huge amount of cash in politics — to a super PAC that supports veterans running for office.

But don’t expect Thursday’s announcement to put a pause to questions about how he spends his fortune and how to understand his legacy — especially given the questions in Silicon Valley and Washington about corporate responsibility. President Trump and his supporters clearly have Bezos in the crosshairs. Amazon is rising at a time of growing distrust of the all-knowing tech giant.

At age 54, Jeff Bezos is more of a figure of public interest, fascination and scrutiny than ever.","princeton university

Bill SB-826, which passed California’s state congress a few weeks ago and is now on Governor Jerry Brown’s desk, would require all public companies with principal executive offices in the state to have a minimum number of women on their boards — proportionate to the total number of board members — within the next few years.

For some major tech companies, including Alphabet, Facebook, Intel, Snap, Apple, Tesla and Yelp, this means that they’ll have to add at least one more female board member by 2021 to meet the bill’s quota. It requires boards with five members to have at least two women, and boards with six or more members to include at least three.

The bill comes amid growing criticism of the lack of gender diversity in tech and other industries, where at publicly traded companies in the past five years the percentage of women on boards has only seen single-digit growth, according to data from executive research firm Equilar.

“The glass ceiling in the C-suite is notorious, and this bill calls upon companies to open up their board rooms,” state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, a Democrat who co-authored the bill, told Recode. Jackson sponsored a non-binding resolution urging companies to add more women to their boards back in 2013, but says most companies ignored the request and “have really not moved the needle at all” on the issue.

If companies are found breaking the rule, they will be fined $100,000 initially and $300,000 for subsequent violations. That’s not enough to make a dent in the pocketbook of a company like Alphabet, but it is likely to make a statement.

“By bringing more public consciousness to this, we hope we can put a little more pressure on these companies to comply,” Jackson said.

Most household-name tech companies are nowhere near having equal representation of women on their boards. Of the 13 Recode researched, HP had the highest share of female board members at 40 percent, or four out of 10 board members, followed by Twitter at 36 percent. Alphabet had the lowest share with less than 20 percent, or two out of 11 board members.

The bill could affect companies like Airbnb and Slack as well, which are expected to go public soon. Although Airbnb just added its first woman, Ann Mather, to its board in August, it still has two fewer women than what the new rules would require.

Recode reached out to several major tech companies for their positions on the bill. Alphabet declined to comment directly on the legislation but referred to a previous statement Board Chairman John Hennessy made about company efforts to recruit a diverse board. Salesforce, Snap, Airbnb, Intel, Slack and Yelp declined to comment and Facebook and Tesla did not respond.

While all of these high-profile tech companies are far from gender parity on their boards, they still rate better than the tech industry as a whole, which includes many lesser-known hardware manufacturers and enterprise software companies.

Just 16 percent of board members on tech companies in the Russell 3000 — a grouping of the 3,000 biggest publicly traded tech companies in the U.S. — are women, according to June 30 data from Equilar. The average across all industries — not just tech — is only slightly better, with 18 percent women board members.

Overall, that share has grown from 12 percent of board seats filled by women in 2013, according to Equilar. But to advocates who want to see these numbers rise to 50 percent or more in the next few years, that growth is too slow.

Tech investor and diversity advocate Freada Kapor Klein said she worries that if the bill passes, women who are placed on boards might be considered “diversity hires” or “quota hires” and that their real contributions could be minimized.

“Like so many other initiatives, this bill is well intentioned, but it is going to have negative unintended consequences,” she told Recode. “That being said, I think that if you have a critical mass [of women], you actually do change culture.”

Studies have shown that having several women on a board can shift power dynamics so that women feel less isolated and ignored by their male peers.

Some critics of the bill, such as the California Chamber of Commerce, have argued that the bill leaves out requirements around other aspects of diversity, such as race and sexual orientation.

Sen. Jackson called that argument a red herring.

“There are a number of eminently qualified women of color — the notion that we are not considering diversity is almost an insult to women of color,” Jackson said.

The fate of the bill is now in Gov. Brown’s hands, who will have until the end of the month to decide whether or not to sign it into law.","california chamber of commerce

Bundesbank President Jen Weidmann said German banks were not only victims of the 2008 financial crisis, but many institutions had also taken on more risk than they could ultimately carry.

Regulations had been tightened since then, but it would be “an illusion” to think that governments could completely avert such crises, he said.","reutershannibal hanschke bundesbank

(Reuters) - Deadly storm Florence drenched North Carolina with yet more downpours on Sunday, cutting off the city of Wilmington, damaging tens of thousands of homes and threatening worse flooding as rivers fill to bursting point.

The death toll rose to at least 14 from Florence, which crashed into the state as a hurricane on Friday, bringing record rainfall.

It had weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday, but was forecast to drop another 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 cm) of rain in North Carolina, bringing rainfall totals in some inland areas to 15 to 20 inches and over 30 inches (76 cm) closer to the coast, according to the National Hurricane Center.

“The storm has never been more dangerous than it is now,” North Carolina’s emergency management office said on Twitter, quoting Governor Roy Cooper. “Many rivers are still rising, and are not expected to crest until later today or tomorrow.”

More than 900 people were rescued from rising flood waters and 15,000 remained in shelters in the state, Cooper told a news conference on Sunday.

At least 10 people have died so far in the storm in North Carolina, including a mother and child killed by a falling tree, state officials said. Four people died in South Carolina, including a woman whose car hit a fallen tree.

People who evacuated were eager to return home but officials urged them to stay away.

“Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington,” New Hanover County Commission chairman Woody White told a news conference. “We want you home but you can’t come yet.”

Fresh evacuations were ordered further inland as rivers crested and spilled out of their banks.

In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people some 90 miles (145 km) from the ocean, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk.

“The worst is yet to come,” Mayor Mitch Colvin told a news conference on Saturday.

North Carolina Emergency Management Director Michael Sprayberry said it was too early to estimate how many people in the state would be made homeless by the storm.

“Right now, we are thinking that there will tens of thousands of homes that are going to be damaged,” he said.

DIN OF GENERATORS

In Leland, a low-lying city north of Wilmington, homes and local businesses were engulfed by water.

Gas stations were abandoned, with many pumps keeled over, and fallen trees cluttered many roads, making them impassable. The whir of generators could be heard throughout the city, a sound not expected to dim soon as crews work to restore power.

About 756,000 homes and businesses were without power in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million.

In Belville, just south of Leland, some shops had power restored on Sunday.

“I thought I’d come out here and see if I could get more fuel, but no luck,” said Steve McLean outside a Harris Teeter gasoline station that had electricity, but no gasoline.

“So far we’ve been holding up pretty well,” said McLean, 72, a self-employed heating and air conditioning contractor. “We’ll see how long this lasts.”

Five people were arrested for breaking into a Dollar General Store, said the police department in Wilmington, which has imposed a nighttime curfew.

Florence set a record in the state for rain from a hurricane, dumping 33.9 inches (86 cm) in Swansboro, North Carolina. The previous record was 24 inches (61 cm), set by Hurricane Floyd, which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with private forecasting service DTN Marine Weather.

North Carolina officials warned motorists not to drive on roads in a large area - south of the I-64 and east of the I-73/74 highways - because of hazardous conditions in the southeast of the state. Swelling rivers and creeks threatened dams and bridges.

The flooding could taint waterways with murky coal ash. But so far officials said the state’s many lagoons of toxic hog waste had withstood the storm.

By Sunday morning Florence’s winds had dropped to about 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The storm was moving at 10 mph (16 kph), with its center expected to cross the western Carolinas during Sunday and the Ohio Valley and Northeast United States on Monday and Tuesday.

The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans to visit the region this week, tweeted his condolences to the families and friends of those who died.

As the United States dealt with Florence, a super typhoon made landfall in China’s Guangdong on Sunday after barreling past Hong Kong and Macau and killing dozens of people in the Philippines.

The United States and China have already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other’s goods. The White House has proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including furniture, handbags and some computer parts.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to move forward with levies on an additional $267 billion - in essence, all Chinese imports into the United States.

The inclusion of consumer goods is a shift from previous rounds of U.S. tariffs, which have primarily hit the industrial sector. Shares of companies such as Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc have risen and fallen in tandem with trade sentiment.

On Wednesday, the Trump administration said that it invited Chinese officials to restart trade talks, which has been welcomed by Beijing. U.S. stocks have perked up on the news, but that optimism could be fleeting.

“Investors in general are too predisposed to react too positively to any signs of improvement in the situation,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. “I don’t expect the (Trump) administration to back down.”

Companies in the tech and consumer discretionary sectors have begun sounding alarm bells. A broad array of U.S. industry groups, representing companies such as Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Walmart Inc and Mattel Inc, has voiced opposition to the new tariffs.

Even Apple Inc, whose stock has contributed heavily to the S&P 500’s gains, has warned that the proposed tariffs would affect several of its products, including the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, though it did not mention the iPhone.

In part because of trade issues, shares of tech companies have gotten off to a rocky start in September. As of Thursday’s close, the S&P 500 tech sector had fallen 1.2 percent this month, versus a 0.1 percent rise for the S&P 500 as a whole. S&P 500 consumer discretionary stocks had risen 0.2 percent, less than the 2 percent advance in industrial stocks.

“The next round of escalation really does impact the leadership of the market,” said Lisa Shalett, head of investment and portfolio strategies at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.

In anticipation of heightened trade tensions, companies have built up inventory, which could have an adverse effect on supply chains later on, Shalett said. Inventory pile-ups have already pushed down pricing in the semiconductor industry. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index had fallen 2.8 percent in September as of Thursday’s close.

Consumer-oriented companies face a catch-22 in their response to tariffs. Those that compete on price, such as Walmart, will likely have to absorb the cost of levies, which will cut into their margins. But companies that pass costs onto consumers, as Apple has indicated it will do, risk dampening demand for their products.

Invesco’s Hooper pointed to washing machines as an example. Tariffs on steel and aluminum caused Whirlpool Corp to raise prices on its appliances, and its second-quarter earnings slumped as a result.

To be sure, consumer electronics are flashier products than a washer-dryer set. And U.S. tech companies can skirt some tariffs by shipping Chinese-made parts directly to other countries for assembly and then importing the finished items into the United States, said Scott Yuschak, equity strategy analyst at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. The list of targeted items in the next round of tariffs excludes cell phones, for instance.

With such mitigating factors, many investors are reluctant to make sweeping changes to their portfolios, though Morgan Stanley’s Shalett has recommended a rotation into defensive sectors.

Many are likely waiting for third-quarter earnings for more details on the impact of trade, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.

But further signs of escalation in the U.S.-China trade war could quickly raise the stakes for the S&P’s leading sectors. The final round of levies would include consumer electronic products imported from China. Some market watchers fear that China, which cannot match the United States in tit-for-tat tariffs, would respond by restricting U.S. companies’ ability to sell products in the country.

“If you look at the broad base of technology, there isn’t much impact at this point,” said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta. “But if you include the iPhone into tariffs, then that changes the whole game.”","microsoft corp amazoncom inc walmart inc

“I shouldn’t have said it. It also proves I would not be a good politician,” Dimon said in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.”

On Wednesday, Dimon quickly backtracked after saying he could beat Trump in a campaign but not liberal Democrats.

Trump had a sharp rejoinder for Dimon on Thursday, saying the JPMorgan chief executive lacked the “smarts” to be president but was otherwise wonderful.

Dimon said he was speaking “more out of frustration and my own machismo,” and had no plans to run for president.

“I never say never to anything, but no,” Dimon said when asked if he would run for president.

The bank executive said he felt Trump’s policies were helping the economy.

“He should take some credit,” Dimon said, for regulatory and tax changes. “That has helped the economy. It is impossible to tease out how much.”","washington reuters jpmorgan chase co

Britain has charged two Russian men, identified as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, with attempting to murder Skripal and his daughter Yulia by spraying a chemical weapon on Skripal’s front door in the southern English city of Salisbury in March.

“The fact is that neither Petrov nor Boshirov have nothing to do with Putin, and the Kremlin of course,” Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying.

Putin said on Wednesday that the two men were civilians and that there was “nothing special and criminal” about them.

The duo appeared on Russia’s state-funded RT television station on Thursday, insisting they were innocent tourists who had flown to London for fun and visited the city of Salisbury to see its cathedral.

Britain has said the two men were Russian military intelligence officers almost certainly acting on orders from high up in the Russian state. Russia has vehemently denied any involvement in the incidents.

Skripal - a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain’s MI6 foreign intelligence service - and his daughter were found slumped unconscious on a bench in Salisbury in March. They spent weeks in hospital before being discharged.","reutershannah mckayfile photo putin

Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29. But with Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plans still not accepted, some lawmakers, as well as union and business leaders, are arguing for people to have a final say on any deal with Brussels.

May has repeatedly ruled out a second referendum. She says members of parliament will get to vote on whether to accept any final deal.

The backing of Khan, a member of the main opposition Labour party, for a second referendum will put more pressure on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to change his opposition to the idea when the party meets for its annual conference in a week’s time.

A second referendum, dubbed a “people’s vote” by its proponents, is not Labour party policy, although finance spokesman John McDonnell said last month that no option should be off the table.

London backed remaining in the EU in the June 2016 referendum that went in favor of leaving.

Khan said Britain was now facing either a bad deal or a no-deal Brexit, both of which were “incredibly risky”.

Writing in Sunday’s Observer newspaper, he blamed the government’s handling of the negotiations and said the threat to living standards, the economy and jobs was too great for voters not to have a say.

“The government’s abject failure – and the huge risk we face of a bad deal or a no-deal Brexit – means that giving people a fresh say is now the right – and only – approach left for our country,” he said.

GOVERNMENT LIFELINE

Labour’s international trade spokesman Barry Gardiner said a second referendum would throw the Conservative government a lifeline.

“If this government cannot do what it is supposed to and govern, then we need actually to change the government,” he told Sky News.

Khan said the “sensible thing” would be for the prime minister to call a general election if she did not have support for any Brexit deal.

“(But) if there’s not going to be a general election, the next best thing is for the British public to have a say on the outcome of the negotiations,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr.

Environment Minister Michael Gove, a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU more than two years ago, said Khan wanted to frustrate the vote.

“People voted clearly - 17.4 million people voted to leave the European Union - and Sadiq is essentially saying ‘Stop, let’s delay that whole process, let’s throw it into chaos’ and I think that would be a profound mistake,” he told Marr.

Theresa May said on Sunday she was focused on her plan for a relationship with the EU based on a common rulebook for all goods, and that she was “a little bit irritated” by constant speculation about her position.

“This debate is not about my future; this debate is about the future of the people of the UK and the future of the United Kingdom,” she said in excerpts from an interview with the BBC that will be broadcast on Monday

“It’s ensuring that we get that good deal from the European Union which is good for people in the UK, wherever they live in the UK, that’s what’s important for us.”

But with time running out for London and Brussels to thrash out a deal, Britain is preparing plans for a no-deal Brexit.

Finance Minister Philip Hammond told senior ministers last week that Brexit could have to be delayed beyond March 29 in order to pass new laws, The Sun newspaper said on Saturday.

The idea was immediately rejected by May, the report said.

Anti-Kremlin activist Pyotr Verzilov who lost his sight, hearing and ability to walk in a suspected poisoning last week arrives on a special medical transport plane at Schoenefeld airport in Berlin, Germany September 15, 2018. Cinemaforpeace/Handout via REUTERS

Pyotr Verzilov, publisher of a Russian online news outlet and affiliated with the anti-Kremlin band Pussy Riot, arrived in Berlin from Moscow late on Saturday on a medical transport plane, the managing director of the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace human rights group, Jaka Bizilj, said. The group paid for the transport, and Bizilj said that Russia had been “cooperative” in the matter.

Photographs taken by Bizilj at Berlin’s Schoenefeld airport showed Verzilov on a stretcher, his eyes closed, as he was being transferred to an ambulance.

Verzilov, 30, became ill after attending a court hearing in Moscow on Tuesday and later suffered seizures while in an ambulance en route to a hospital in Moscow, Bizilj said in a news release.

“He’s better. Everything is okay,” Pussy Riot member Veronika Nikulshina told Reuters on Sunday from Verzilov’s hospital room in Berlin. “The doctors here are great.” She made no further comment.

Verzilov was being treated at the Charite hospital in the German capital, according to a source familiar with the matter. The hospital declined to comment.

German newspaper Bild, which first reported Verzilov’s arrival, on Saturday quoted family members as saying he had lost his sight, his ability to speak and his ability to walk.

Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Verzilov’s wife and a Pussy Riot member, told the newspaper she believed he was poisoned. “I believe that he was poisoned intentionally, and that it was an attempt to intimidate him or kill him,” she said.

Nikulshina told the BBC that a friend of Verzilov’s father would treat him.

Bizilj said Verzilov had both Russian and Canadian citizenship. He said doctors at the clinic were expected to inform the public on Monday about the activist’s condition.

The Canadian government said it was monitoring the situation closely and was seeking more information.

“Canada is concerned by the situation of Canadian citizen Pyotr Verzilov. Our officials have been in contact with Mr. Verzilov’s family, and stand ready to provide further consular assistance,” a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada said.

The German foreign ministry declined to comment, citing Germany’s strict privacy laws.

Verzilov is publisher of Mediazona, a Russian online news outlet which focuses on human rights violations inside Russia’s penal system. He staged a brief pitch invasion during the soccer World Cup final in Moscow in July along with three women affiliated with Pussy Riot.

It was not clear if the medical transfer was discussed at a meeting on Friday between German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Pussy Riot came to prominence in 2012 when its members were jailed for staging a protest against Russian President Vladimir Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral in Moscow. The group has since become a symbol of anti-Kremlin protest action.","cinemaforpeacehandout

Demonstrators including high-school students gathered peacefully in the heart of Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, held signs and chanted slogans denouncing the guilty verdict against the two journalists. A small contingent of police looked on as the protesters released black balloons printed with the words “Free Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo”.

Reporters Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were convicted on Sept. 3 under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act in a case that was seen as a test of democratic freedoms in Myanmar.

Thar Lun Zaung Htet, a journalist involved in organizing the protest, said the verdict against reporters who were “just doing their job” would stifle reporting in Myanmar.

“Losing press freedom means our democratic transition is going backwards,” he said.

The verdict drew calls from senior United Nations officials, political figures including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and human rights advocates around the world for their immediate release.

Government spokesman Zaw Htay could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

The country’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi said at a forum in Hanoi last week the case had nothing to do with freedom of expression. The reporters had been sentenced for handling official secrets and “were not jailed because they were journalists”, the Nobel laureate said.

On Friday six Myanmar journalist organizations published a rare statement from groups within the country criticizing the country’s leader, saying they were “disappointed” with her comments.

The reporters, who plead not guilty, said they were handed rolled papers by police shortly before they were detained last December, and a police witness testified in court that they had been set up.

The reporters had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and local Buddhists amid a military response to insurgent attacks last August.

Some 700,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh fleeing the crackdown, which U.N.-mandated investigators said last month was launched by senior Myanmar generals with “genocidal intent”.

Signs held by the protesters on Sunday included the messages “Murder is not a state secret” and “revealing the truth is not a crime”.

One organizer, Maung Saung Kha, performed a short play where he put on a military jacket over the orange traditional Burmese jacket worn by lawmakers of Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy. He then rolled up a copy of the state-run daily The Mirror and began hitting members of the press with it.

Activist Htet Khine Soe said the “injustice” of the case against the reporters had led him to design a T-shirt with an illustration of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo’s faces. The design was worn by some demonstrators and was also used on stickers placed around Yangon.

Packing winds of more than 200 kph (125 mph) at its peak, tropical cyclone Mangkhut is considered the strongest to hit the region this year.

Its strength outstripped that of Hurricane Florence, which achieved maximum sustained winds of 150 kph (90 mph) when it roared into North Carolina in the United States on Friday.

The eye of Mangkhut, the Thai name for Southeast Asia’s mangosteen fruit, skirted 100 kms (62 miles) south of Hong Kong but the former British colony was still caught in the typhoon’s swirling bands of rain and gale-force winds.

Hong Kong raised its highest No. 10 typhoon signal mid-morning as ferocious winds uprooted trees and smashed windows in office and residential buildings, some of which swayed in the gusts, residents said.

“It swayed for quite a long time, at least two hours. It made me feel so dizzy,” said Elaine Wong, who lives in a high-rise tower in Kowloon.

Water levels surged 3.5 m (12 ft) in some places and waves swamped roads and threw up live fish, washing into some residential blocks and a mall in the eastern Heng Fa Chuen district.

“It’s the worst I’ve seen,” resident Martin Wong told Reuters. “I’ve not seen the roads flood like this (and) the windows shake like this before.”

Flight cancellations at Hong Kong’s international airport, a major regional hub, disrupted the plans of tens of thousands of travelers. Airlines such as flagship carrier Cathay Pacific canceled many flights last week.

In the Philippines, casualties reported by various agencies on Sunday evening indicate the death toll from the impact of Mangkhut could exceed 50, with most killed in landslides in or near mountainous areas of the Cordillera region.

Francis Tolentino, an advisor to President Rodrigo Duterte and head of the government’s disaster coordination, said the latest number of casualties was 33 dead and 56 missing.

But the head of the military’s Northern Luzon Command, Emmanuel Salamat, told Reuters that at least 19 more were killed in landslides in one part of Benguet province.

The 19 who died were part of a bigger group of 43 people, likely miners, and those who were still alive were feared to be trapped in an old mining bunkhouse that had collapsed under rubble, Salamat said.

Search and rescue missions were ongoing, and a local mayor in Benguet, Victorio Palangdan, said he feared the number killed there could be more than 100.

Separately, the coastguard said it had recovered the bodies of three people.

In Macau, which took the unprecedented step of halting casino gambling late on Saturday, there was serious flooding of up to 2.5 meters, authorities said, with some people having to be rescued from homes on rubber dinghies.

“The suspension is for the safety of casino employees, visitors to the city, and residents,” said authorities in the world’s largest gambling hub, who faced criticism last year after a typhoon that killed nine and caused severe damage.

Around 20,000 Macau households also suffered a power blackout, local media reported.

“KING OF STORMS”

The typhoon, dubbed the “King of Storms” by Chinese media, made landfall in Haiyan town at 5 p.m. local time, weather officials said.

Ports, oil refineries and industrial plants in the area have been shut. Power to some areas was also reduced as a precaution. In Shenzhen, the electricity supply to more than 130,000 homes was cut at one point on Sunday.

The storm has fueled concern about sugar production in Guangdong, which accounts for a tenth of national output at about 1 million tonnes. China sugar futures rose last week on fears for the cane crop.

Guangdong is also China’s most populous province, with a population of more than 100 million.

According to state media, two people were killed in Guangdong due to the typhoon as of 8:00 p.m. local time.

More than 2.45 million people have been relocated and over 48,000 fishing boats called back to port in the province. Work at more than 29,000 construction sites has been suspended.

State television showed scenes of crashing waves, inundated streets and trees half-bent by the strong winds as Mangkhut unleashed its power.

Shenzhen airport, shut since midnight, will be closed until 8:00 a.m. (2400 GMT) on Monday. Flights have also been canceled in Guangzhou and the island of Hainan, China’s southernmost province.

High winds and swells also hit Fujian province north of Guangdong, shutting ports, suspending ferry services and cancelling more than 100 flights. Waves as high as 7.3 meters (24 ft) were sighted in the Taiwan Strait, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

Traveling at 30 kph (19 mph), Mangkhut will continue on its northwesterly track, bringing heavy rain and winds to the autonomous region of Guangxi early on Monday.

It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression when it reaches southwestern Yunnan province the early hours of Tuesday.

The tariff level will probably be about 10 percent, the Wall Street Journal reported, quoting people familiar with the matter. This is below the 25 percent the administration said it was considering for this possible round of tariffs.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The upcoming tariffs will be on a list of items that included $200 billion worth of internet technology products and other electronics, printed circuit boards and consumer goods including Chinese seafood, furniture and lighting products, tires, chemicals, plastics, bicycles and car seats for babies. It was unclear if the administration will exempt any of the products that were on the list, which was announced in July.

On Friday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump “has been clear that he and his administration will continue to take action to address China’s unfair trade practices. We encourage China to address the long-standing concerns raised by the Unites States.”

Trump had already directed aides to proceed with tariffs, despite Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s attempts to restart trade talks with China.

One observer in the business sector said the administration may have reduced its planned tariff level after hearing public comments, hoping companies would not immediately hike prices for consumer goods to pass along the costs. Still, the additional tariffs could complicate trade talks with China expected later this month.

Trump has demanded that China cut its $375 billion trade surplus with the United States, end policies aimed at acquiring U.S. technologies and intellectual property and roll back high-tech industrial subsidies.

This week, the world’s two largest economies appeared to be making progress on trade. Treasury invited senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Liu He, for more talks.

The administration has already levied duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods following a study on China’s intellectual property practices released earlier this year.

On Sept. 7, Trump warned that he had further tariffs ready to go on $267 billion worth of Chinese imports beyond those that will be targeted this week. If all of the tariffs were invoked, total imports from China facing tariffs would exceed the $505 billion in goods that the United States imported from China last year.

This year, imports from China through July were up nearly 9 percent from the same period of 2017, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.

Since Dara Khosrowshahi came to Uber as CEO about a year ago, there has certainly been less drama, but drama remains. Over the last few months, there were reports of Uber COO Barney Harford making insensitive comments about women and racial minorities, as well as Uber’s now-former Chief People Officer Liane Hornsey making denigrating comments toward Uber’s global diversity and inclusion lead Bernard Coleman and Bozoma Saint John, the chief brand officer who left in June.

At TechCrunch Disrupt SF earlier this month, I sat down with both Khosrowshahi and Uber’s new, first-ever Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee, who joined in March. Believe it or not, there are still bad actors at the company, so Uber still has work to do. What surprised me, however, was Khosrowshahi’s defense of Harford, not only saying that he’s “an incredible person” but that he’s also “one of the good people” as it relates to diversity and inclusion.

“This is an issue that everyone is fighting, and I will tell you Barney takes it personally,” Khosrowshahi told me. “And he is a champion and he will be a champion as it relates to these matters. He’s one of the good people.”

Lee, when I asked her if she agreed with Khosrowshahi, said at Disrupt, “absolutely, 100 percent.” Lee, on a call ahead of Disrupt, described the importance of internal diversity champions who find ways to bake diversity and inclusion into their everyday workflow. Onstage, Lee described how she had been aware of the allegations against Harford and had already been working with him around inclusion. In fact, she said, Harford had reached out to her, admitting that he knew there’s a lot to learn and that he’d like for her to help him.

Harford also wrote, in Khosrowshahi’s words, “a really heartfelt apology letter to the company,” but it’s still hard for me to get on board with the idea that Harford is one of the “good” ones. This is not to say people can’t be imperfect and can’t change — an idea Khosrowshahi made quite clear, and one that I generally believe as well — but I would just hope that there are some better “good” ones out there.

“I don’t think that a comment that might have been taken as insensitive and happened to report by large news organizations should mark a person,” Khosrowshahi said. “I don’t think that’s fair. And I’m sure I’ve said things that have been insensitive and you take that as a learning moment. And the question is, does a person want to change, does a person wants to improve? Does a person understand when they did something wrong, and then change behaviors? And I’ve known Barney for years and that’s why I stand 100 percent behind him.”

Khosrowshahi described how he’s also made mistakes, and how that doesn’t mean he should be marked by those mistakes. He went on to describe how at his last job, Expedia, he would usually grab a beer with “one of the guys and, because I was comfortable because it was you know, a person who looked like me, a person with whom I could be more casual and I could have a conversation.”

He added how these people got “access to me that was not fair, and that could have shown up in a New York Times article and that could have marked me,” he said. “That’s not who I am. You know, I learned, I corrected, I’m aware. And the question is, what do you do?”

A new chief in town

During my conversation with Khosrowshahi, we also chatted about the hiring of Lee as CDO, as opposed to promoting Coleman, and the fact that she doesn’t report directly to the CEO — despite the suggestions of former Attorney General Eric Holder. Though, it’s worth noting those suggestions were directed toward now-former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.

Khosrowshahi said Lee is the right person for the job and he thinks it’ll become clear that she is the right person for the job. Regarding why Lee doesn’t report directly to Khosrowshahi and instead, to a yet-to-be-hired new chief people officer, he said, “diversity and inclusion have to be a core part of everything that the company does, has to be a core part of your people strategy.”

“And I want Bo and my chief people officer working together fundamentally not just on the diversity of the company, but also on the core culture,” he added. “Like, we’re really trying to shift the culture of the company going forward. So Bo is going to report into our chief people officer. And she and I more than monthly, are constantly having exchanges on how things are going. And I think that’s the optimal structure, which is open — open communication with me working directly with the CEO but part of the core strategy of the company because I do think that this is one of the things that we have to execute on.”

In conversation with Lee, she spoke about the task she has at hand, as well as some strategies she has implemented, and plans to implement in order to get Uber to where it needs to be. One of those initiatives involves creating a pipeline around Uber drivers, which consists of a couple million people around the world. Lee described to me how it would be “amazing to create a pipeline to hire some of those driver partners,” whether into customer service, community operations or “maybe there’s great tech talent in there that we don’t even know about.”

That’s an area where Lee is working with recruiters to better identify ways to source that talent. Lee is also working on ensuring Uber’s new cultural norms actually get baked into the company. Last November, Khosrowshahi introduced Uber’s new cultural norms, which include values like “We build globally, we live locally” and “We do the right thing. Period.” Before, Uber’s values were indisputably much more aggressive.

“You can put out new cultural norms, you can put out new cultural values but it’s not until those values are built into our systems, our performance management, our organizational design — the way that we even think about product design, you’re not going to see the full manifestation of it,” Lee said. “And as an organization is going through culture change, that can be very unmooring for people and that can actually make people feel very psychologically unsafe. And what I find at Uber right now is a lot of people who are trying to — within this culture that is shifting, that is changing for the better — trying to find their footing somewhere along those lines.”

Part of what’s hard right now, she said, is getting Uber employees to the point where they “feel like they can trust that the system will work.” Regarding the allegations about Harford, Lee said that she was aware of them and looking into them, but didn’t resolve them by the time the NYT piece came out.

“But I would say that when the news did break in that public way, I was, more than anything, just really sad about this because what it told me was that we still have a culture where people aren’t sure they can trust that things are going to get fixed and things are going to get done,” she said. “And so they felt that they needed to go outside to find remediation for some of that.”

Lee also told me, ahead of Disrupt, that she’s exploring the idea of what fewer levels of hierarchy at the company would look like.

“It’s hard to speculate what the changes would look like,” she said. “I ideally would love to see the number of levels possibly changing. More importantly, what I would love to see beyond levels, is the power distance between those levels decline.”","travis kalanick khosrowshahi

Or at least if you do end up stuck bumper-to-bumper, the warning could make you less likely to get mad mid-ride and take it out on the driver’s rating.

This week TechCrunch spotted Uber overlaying blue, yellow, and red traffic condition bars on your route map before you hail. Responding to TechCrunch’s inquiry, Uber confirmed that traffic estimates have been quietly testing for riders on Android over the past few months and the pilot program recently expanded to a subset of iOS users. It’s already live for all drivers.

The congestion indicators are based on Uber’s own traffic information pulled from its historic trip data about 10 billion rides plus real-time data from its drivers’ phones, rather than estimates from Google that already power Uber’s maps.

If traffic estimates do roll out, they could make users more tolerant of longer ETAs and less likely to check a competing app since they’ll know their driver might take longer to pick them up because congestion is to blame rather than Uber’s algorithm. During the ride they might be more patient amidst the clogged streets.

But most interestingly, seeing traffic conditions could help users choose when it’s time to take one of Uber’s non-car choices. They could sail past traffic in one of Uber’s new electric JUMP Bikes, or buy a public transportation ticket from inside Uber thanks to its new partnership with Masabi for access to New York’s MTA plus buses and trains in other cities. Cheaper and less labor intensive for Uber, these options make more sense to riders the more traffic there is. It’s to the company’s advantage to steer users towards the most satisfying mode of transportation, and traffic info could point them in the right direction.

Through a program called Uber Movement, the company began sharing its traffic data with city governments early last year. The goal was to give urban planners the proof they need to make their streets more efficient. Uber has long claimed that it can help reduce traffic by getting people into shared rides and eliminating circling in search of parking. But a new study showed that for each mile of personal driving Uber and Lyft eliminated, they added 2.8 miles of professional driving for an 180 percent increase in total traffic.

Uber is still learning whether users find traffic estimates helpful before it considers rolling them out permanently to everyone. Right now they only appear on unshared UberX, Black, XL, SUV, and Taxi routes before you hail to a small percentage of users. But Uber’s spokesperson verified that the company’s long-term goal is to be able to tell users that the cheapest way to get there is option X, the cheapest is option Y, and the most comfortable is option Z. Traffic estimates are key to that. And now that it’s had so many cars on the road for so long, it has the signals necessary to predict which streets will be smooth and which will be jammed at a given hour.

For years, Uber called itself a logistics company, not a ride sharing company. Most people gave it a knowing wink. Every Silicon Valley company tries to trump up its importance by claiming to conquer a higher level of abstraction. But with advent of personal transportation modes like on-demand bikes and scooters, Uber is poised to earn the title by getting us from point A to point B however we prefer.","bumpertobumper

Theranos reached that summit, and it all came crashing down.

The story of the fraudulent rise and precipitous fall of the company and its entrepreneur, Elizabeth Holmes, is also the singular story of the journalist who chronicled the company. John Carreyrou’s tenacious and intrepid reporting at the Wall Street Journal would ultimately expose one of the largest frauds ever perpetrated in Silicon Valley.

Bad Blood is the culmination of that investigative reporting. The swift decline of Theranos and its protective legal apparatus has done this story a lot of good: many of the anonymous sources that underpinned Carreyrou’s WSJ coverage are now public and visible, allowing the author to weave together the various articles he published into a holistic and complete story.

And yet, what I found in the book was not all that thrilling or shocking, but rather astonishingly pedestrian.

Part of the challenge is Carreyrou’s laconic WSJ tone, with its “just the facts” attitude that is punctuated only occasionally by brief interludes on the motivations and psychology of its characters. That style is appreciated by this subscriber of the paper daily, but the book-length treatment suffers a bit from a lack of charisma.

The real challenge though is that the raw story — for all of its fraud — lacks the sort of verve that makes business thrillers like Barbarians at the Gate or Red Notice so engaging. The characters that Carreyrou has to work with just aren’t all that interesting. One could argue that perhaps the book is too early — with criminal charges filed and court trials coming, we may well learn much more about the conspiracy and its participants. But I don’t think so, mostly because the fraud seems so simple in its premise.

At the heart of this story is the use of heuristics by investors and customers to make their largest decisions. Theranos is a story of the snowball effect blown up to an avalanche: a retired and successful venture capitalist seeds the company, leading to other investors to see that name and invest, and onwards and upwards for more than a decade, eventually collecting a cast of characters around the table that includes James Mattis, the current Secretary of Defense, and Henry Kissinger.

Take Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire owner of News Corporation (and by extension the Wall Street Journal), who invested $125 million into Theranos near the end of the company’s story. He met Holmes at a dinner in Silicon Valley:

During the dinner, Holmes came over to Murdoch’s table, introduced herself, and chatted him up. The strong first impression she made on him was bolstered by [Yuri] Milner, who sang her praises when Murdoch later asked him what he thought of the young woman. …. But unlike the big venture capital firms, he did no due diligence to speak of. The eighty-four-year-old mogul tended to just follow his gut, an approach that had served him well …

He made one call before investing $125 million.

To some readers, that might be a breathtaking sum, but it really is something of a pittance for Murdoch, whose reported net worth today is roughly $17 billion. In the denouement of the Theranos story, Carreyrou notes that, “The media mogul sold his stock back to Theranos for one dollar so he could claim a big tax write-off on his other earnings. With a fortune estimated at $12 billion, Murdoch could afford to lose more than $100 million on a bad investment.”

For Murdoch, a bad heuristic around the company cost him roughly 1% of his net wealth, and with the tax loss, may not have cost him much of anything at all.

That’s the challenge of the book: for all the fraud committed by Theranos and its founder, its financial losses were ultimately borne by the ultra-rich. This is not the 2008 Financial Crisis, where millions of people are thrown out of their homes due to the chicanery of Wall Street fat cats.

If there is a lesson in all of this, it is that the right heuristics would have helped these investors to an extraordinarily degree. Take for example the rapid turnover of Theranos’ workforce, which could have been checked on LinkedIn in minutes and would have signaled something deeply wrong with the company’s culture and leadership. It doesn’t take many questions to discover the fraud here if they are the right questions.

Beyond the investors and workers though, the harm is even hard to track to patients. There are perhaps no more serious consequences around Theranos’ fraud than for patients, who took tests on the company’s proprietary Edison machines and received inaccurate and at times faked results. Yet, Carreyrou strangely hasn’t compiled a compelling set of patients for whom Theranos caused morbidity. If any industry comes out positively in this book, it is the doctors of patients who reorder tests and ask additional questions when results didn’t make sense.

Ultimately, Bad Blood is a complete book about an important story. I’m reminded a bit of the 2012 documentary The Act of Killing, in which the filmmakers travel to Indonesia to have the killers of the 1965 communist genocide recreate the murders they perpetrated. The director’s cut is long and at times remarkably tedious, and yet, that is in many ways precisely the point. As a viewer, you become inured to the murder, bereft of emotion while waiting for the ending credits to roll.

Bad Blood is the same: its direct, to the point, and relatively sparing in any deep thrills. And that is its point. The book gives us a pinprick in our belief that Silicon Valley’s vaunted investors and founders are immune to stupidity. If you didn’t already know that before, you certainly now have a one-word household name of a startup to reference.","extension the wall street journal

He You Bing is traveling and carrying nothing with her, and she has to retrieve food, housing, and basic necessities all through bitcoin transactions done on her phone. Interestingly, she is also doing this challenge in some of China’s largest cities including Beijing and Shenzhen.

Her name is something of a nom de guerre – a nickname, with “You Bing” directly translating to “having a disease,” and the whole name alludes to the girl’s over-enthusiasm for bitcoin.

It’s a fascinating time for making this attempt. In the last few weeks, there have been numerous reports of China’s crypto bans – including Beijing and Shenzhen banning public cryptocurrency-related speeches, events, or activities, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. Also included in the purported ban were a number of WeChat media accounts that promoted cryptocurrencies, which have been permanently blocked. Furthermore, Beijing blocked access to the websites of over 120 offshore exchanges in the mainland and banned large crypto purchases through popular Chinese payments platforms Alipay and WeChat transactions.

Given the sheer number of these bans, readers who live outside of China may be led to think that there is a bleak outlook for the cryptocurrency environment on mainland China. But He You Bing’s Bitcoin challenge reveals a refreshing perspective on the crypto awareness of people living in these local cities as well as the power of WeChat. $1,300 may not sound like much for 21 days of travel in the U.S., but in China, where a cheap meal costs just $1, it can go a long way. The real question is, will people accept bitcoin?

Finding acceptance with bitcoin

Through daily video-log like documentaries, Bing is filmed running around asking different business vendors whether they accept bitcoin. The vendors, varying from small hole-in-the-wall eateries to employees from large chain stores like Uniqlo, express their reactions that are telling of their preconceived notions, or lack thereof, of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Similar to the U.S., people’s attitudes vary from ignorance and distrust to welcoming. It’s eye-opening to see how different Chinese people think about bitcoin.

On the first day of her challenge, Bing arrives in Beijing, where she wants to go to an amusement park. The entrance fee is 2 Chinese Yuan, or around 30 cents in USD, but the park didn’t accept bitcoin. Bing also asked several fast food restaurants whether they accepted bitcoin so she could buy food, but neither of them did.

As she approaches these vendors, rather than paying in bitcoin, she often has to explain what a bitcoin is in the first place, and finds very little success along the way. One feat on her first day is that she was able to find an unlocked Ofo bike, a dockless bike that can be unlocked and paid for with one’s cellphone. With it, she biked around in an attempt to reach out to more vendors. By the end of the first day, Bing didn’t succeed in finding a food place that accepted bitcoin, and she subsisted on four packets of ketchup and food samples from a supermarket. She slept in a 24-hour McDonald’s on her first night.

The second day, Bing foraged for food. She grabbed fruits from wild trees. Her food intake for the second day consisted of some fruits on a tree and someone else’s leftover burger at a McDonald’s. She ended up getting a stomach ache and threw up, sleeping in another 24-hour McDonald’s.

Bing was becoming hopeless by the third day. She was on the the verge of fainting and the filmmakers sent her to a hospital. At this point, the challenge had gathered some attention, and supporters were able to contact the filmmakers. They then brought Bing food and she paid for it by bitcoin. On the third night, she slept in an art gallery.

It’s not the currency, it’s the community

Bing’s story soon spread and people started finding her through WeChat where they would offer to exchange bitcoin to fiat. At that point, the challenge would have become too easy, so the filmmakers changed the rules so that Bing had to transact offline and exchange Bitcoin with people in real life.

On the sixth day, Beijing was having the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit, so the filmmakers moved to Shenzhen to continue the challenge. The audience started getting suspicious of the filmmakers, asking whether they were related to scam projects. The filmmakers said that they were approached by crypto projects but that they declined them. By then, six support groups in WeChat had been created to support Bing, with every WeChat group having 500 people (500 is the max number of people one can have in a WeChat group). These chatroom participants included bitcoin believers, real estate agents, and advertising salesmen.

Despite the current ban on crypto activities, the documentary shows that bitcoin is alive and well in China within digital communities, albeit not prevalent in the physical world. Most of Bing’s days are documented on iQiyi. And her encounters are telling of what is actually happening in China when it comes to cryptocurrency and mobile technology adoption. Notably, Bing was able to get through living in China simply through her phone. The power of WeChat brought her supporters directly to her.

By day seven, Bing got in contact with some of her WeChat supporters and was able to purchase face wash from them. The next day, she found a restaurant that accepted bitcoin. She got someone to buy her clothes at Uniqlo by exchanging bitcoin with them and then also found someone who was willing to book a hotel for her by exchanging bitcoin.

Gradually, Bing’s bitcoin challenge started a small movement, where her supporters would also approach shops to ask whether they accepted bitcoin and relay the information to her.

On a daily basis, the filming team recorded how many business and pedestrians Bing reached out to and the number of successful bitcoin transactions she made. From the initial ten days to now, Bing has gradually gained confidence. She now has a strategy on how to find people to exchange her bitcoins and what to exchange them for. Over time, the number of inquiries Bing did increased from ten to twenty a day to over a hundred per day. The number of successful transactions was still only a handful a day, however.

Bing’s story continues, and she is now at day 19. She and the filmmakers have migrated to the southern city of Guangzhou. As she assimilates into this new lifestyle, Bing found people to exchange Bitcoin to fiat with her to purchase her train tickets, her hotel rooms, and her meals. Nonetheless, more often than ever, the pedestrians and small business vendors she approached were ignorant, skeptical, and did not want to be part of the filming.

Finding utility in bitcoin

Recently, China Daily covered Bing’s challenge. The documentary has gotten some media attention in China, and companies and institutions have asked to donate and sponsor the filmmakers. They have claimed that they have turned them all down.

In the last year, the narrative around bitcoin has gradually centered on becoming a “store of value” in the U.S. given the increasing transaction costs on the blockchain. Bitcoin transaction prices have increased from 30 cents at the beginning of 2017 to $40 at end of 2017 during the peak of bitcoin prices. As a result of such large fluctuations in fees, transactions no longer happened as frequently as before. Bitcoin’s transaction cost is now back down to about 60 cents this year.

However, as the market has come down in the last few months, bitcoin has once again become a “safe haven” for individuals to go to, and as a result, bitcoin now makes up more than 56% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, up from 34% at the beginning of January 2018.

Bing still gets people suspecting that she is trying to scam them. Since the rise of crypto prices and bitcoin reaching almost as high as $20,000 at the end of 2017, there have been numerous scam coins coming out everywhere. In China, there are often obscure and random coins that appear with no real value-add, no relationship to any blockchain, and are devised purely to fool non-savvy citizens who think they can make a quick buck. In fact, one of the purposes of Beijing’s ban on commercial venues hosting cryptocurrency events was aimed at purging coins from scamming the public.

Bing will continue and finish her bitcoin challenge, but the greater challenge is on all of us in the blockchain community to continually improve this technology for broader consumption.","videolog like documentaries bing

In the job ad, Facebook writes that as the reach and impact of its various products continues to grow “so does the responsibility we have to respect the individual and human rights of the members of our diverse global community”, saying it’s:

… looking for a Director of Human Rights Policy to coordinate our company-wide effort to address human rights abuses, including by both state and non-state actors. This role will be responsible for: (1) Working with product teams to ensure that Facebook is a positive force for human rights and apply the lessons we learn from our investigations, (2) representing Facebook with key stakeholders in civil society, government, international institutions, and industry, (3) driving our investigations into and disruptions of human rights abusers on our platforms, and (4) crafting policies to counteract bad actors and help us ensure that we continue to operate our platforms consistent with human rights principles.

Among the minimum requirements for the role, Facebook lists experience “working in developing nations and with governments and civil society organizations around the world”.

It adds that “global travel to support our international teams is expected”.

The company has faced fierce criticism in recent years over its failure to take greater responsibility for the spread of disinformation and hate speech on its platform. Especially in international markets it has targeted for business growth via its Internet.org initiative which seeks to get more people ‘connected’ to the Internet (and thus to Facebook).

More connections means more users for Facebook’s business and growth for its shareholders. But the costs of that growth have been cast into sharp relief over the past several years as the human impact of handing millions of people lacking in digital literacy some very powerful social sharing tools — without a commensurately large investment in local education programs (or even in moderating and policing Facebook’s own platform) — has become all too clear.

In Myanmar Facebook’s tools have been used to spread hate and accelerate ethic cleansing and/or the targeting of political critics of authoritarian governments — earning the company widespread condemnation, including a rebuke from the UN earlier this year which blamed the platform for accelerating ethnic violence against Myanmar’s Muslim minority.

In the Philippines Facebook also played a pivotal role in the election of president Rodrigo Duterte — who now stands accused of plunging the country into its worst human rights crisis since the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970s and 80s.

While in India the popularity of the Facebook-owned WhatsApp messaging platform has been blamed for accelerating the spread of misinformation — leading to mob violence and the deaths of several people.

Facebook famously failed even to spot mass manipulation campaigns going on in its own backyard — when in 2016 Kremlin-backed disinformation agents injected masses of anti-Clinton, pro-Trump propaganda into its platform and garnered hundreds of millions of American voters’ eyeballs at a bargain basement price.

So it’s hardly surprising the company has been equally naive in markets it understands far less. Though also hardly excusable — given all the signals it has access to.

In Myanmar, for example, local organizations that are sensitive to the cultural context repeatedly complained to Facebook that it lacked Burmese-speaking staff — complaints that apparently fell on deaf ears for the longest time.

The cost to American society of social media enabled political manipulation and increased social division is certainly very high. The costs of the weaponization of digital information in markets such as Myanmar looks incalculable.

In the Philippines Facebook also indirectly has blood on its hands — having provided services to the Duterte government to help it make more effective use of its tools. This same government is now waging a bloody ‘war on drugs’ that Human Rights Watch says has claimed the lives of around 12,000 people, including children.

Facebook’s job ad for a human rights policy director includes the pledge that “we’re just getting started” — referring to its stated mission of helping people “build stronger communities”.

But when you consider the impact its business decisions have already had in certain corners of the world it’s hard not to read that line with a shudder.

Citing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (and “our commitments as a member of the Global Network Initiative”), Facebook writes that its product policy team is dedicated to “understanding the human rights impacts of our platform and to crafting policies that allow us both to act against those who would use Facebook to enable harm, stifle expression, and undermine human rights, and to support those who seek to advance rights, promote peace, and build strong communities”.

Clearly it has an awful lot of “understanding” to do on this front. And hopefully it will now move fast to understand the impact of its own platform, circa fifteen years into its great ‘society reshaping experience’, and prevent Facebook from being repeatedly used to trash human rights.

As well as representing the company in meetings with politicians, policymakers, NGOs and civil society groups, Facebook says the new human rights director will work on formulating internal policies governing user, advertiser, and developer behavior on Facebook. “This includes policies to encourage responsible online activity as well as policies that deter or mitigate the risk of human rights violations or the escalation of targeted violence,” it notes.

The director will also work with internal public policy, community ops and security teams to try to spot and disrupt “actors that seek to misuse our platforms and target our users” — while also working to support “those using our platforms to foster peace-building and enable transitional justice”.

So you have to wonder how, for example, Holocaust denial continuing to be being protected speech on Facebook will square with that stated mission for the human rights policy director.

At the same time, Facebook is currently hiring for a public policy manager in Francophone, Africa — who it writes can “combine a passion for technology’s potential to create opportunity and to make Africa more open and connected, with deep knowledge of the political and regulatory dynamics across key Francophone countries in Africa”.

That job ad does not explicitly reference human rights — talking only about “interesting public policy challenges… including privacy, safety and security, freedom of expression, Internet shutdowns, the impact of the Internet on economic growth, and new opportunities for democratic engagement”.

As well as “new opportunities for democratic engagement”, among the role’s other listed responsibilities is working with Facebook’s Politics & Government team to “promote the use of Facebook as a platform for citizen and voter engagement to policymakers and NGOs and other political influencers”.

So here, in a second policy job, Facebook looks to be continuing its ‘business as usual’ strategy of pushing for more political activity to take place on Facebook.

And if Facebook wants an accelerated understanding of human rights issues around the world it might be better advised to take a more joined up approach to human rights across its own policy staff board, and at least include it among the listed responsibilities of all the policy shapers it’s looking to hire.","security freedom of expression internet

Countries across the continent are experimenting with this 21st century technology as a way to leapfrog decades of neglect of 20th century infrastructure.

Over the last two years, San Francisco-based startup Zipline launched a national UAV delivery program in East Africa; South Africa passed commercial drone legislation to train and license pilots; and Malawi even opened a Drone Test Corridor to African and its global partners.

In Rwanda, the country’s government became one of the first adopters of performance-based regulations for all drones earlier this year. The country’s progressive UAV programs drew special attention from the White House and two U.S. Secretaries of Transportation.

Some experts believe Africa’s drone space could contribute to UAV development in the U.S. and elsewhere around the globe.

“The fact that [global drone] companies can operate in Africa and showcase amazing use cases…is a big benefit,” said Lisa Ellsman, co-executive director of the Commercial Drone Alliance.

Test in Africa

It’s clear that the UAV programs in Malawi and Rwanda are getting attention from international drone companies.

Opened in 2017, Malawi’s Drone Test Corridor has been accepting global applications. The program is managed by the country’s Civil Aviation Authority in partnership with UNICEF.

The primary purpose is to test UAV’s for humanitarian purposes, but the program “was designed to provide a controlled platform for… governments…and other partners…to explore how UAV’s can help deliver services,” according to Michael Scheibenreif, UNICEF’s drone lead in Malawi.

That decision to include the private sector opened the launch pads for commercial drones. Swedish firm GLOBEHE has tested using the corridor and reps from Chinese e-commerce company JD have toured the site. Other companies to test in Malawi’s corridor include Belgian UAV air traffic systems company Unifly and U.S. delivery drone manufacturer Vayu, according to Scheibenreif.

Though the government of Rwanda is most visible for its Zipline partnership, it shaping a national testing program for multiple drone actors.

“We don’t want to limit ourselves with just one operator,” said Claudette Irere, Director General of the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications (MiTEC).

“When we started with Zipline it was more of a pilot to see if this could work,” she said. “As we’ve gotten more interest and have grown the program…this gives us an opportunity to open up to other drone operators, and give space to our local UAV operators.”

Irere said Rwanda has been approached by 16 drone operators, “some of them big names”—but could not reveal them due to temporary NDAs. She also highlighted Charis UAS, a Rwandan drone company, that’s used the country’s test program, and is now operating commercially in and outside of Rwanda.

UAV Policy

Africa’s commercial drone history is largely compressed to a handful of projects and countries within the last 5-7 years. Several governments have jumped out ahead on UAV policy.

In 2016, South Africa passed drone legislation regulating the sector under the country’s Civil Aviation Authority. The guidelines set training requirements for commercial drone pilots to receive Remote Pilot Licenses (RPLs) for Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. At the end of 2017 South Africa had registered 686 RPLs and 663 drone aircraft systems, according to a recent State of Drone Report.

Over the last year and a half Kenya, Ghana, and Tanzania have issued or updated drone regulatory guidelines and announced future UAV initiatives.

In 2018, Rwanda extended its leadership role on drone policy when it adopted performance-based regulations for all drones—claiming to be the first country in the world to do so.

So what does this mean?

“In performance-based regulation the government states this is our safety threshold and you companies tell us the combination of technologies and operational mitigations you’re going to use to meet it,” said Timothy Reuter, Civil Drones Project Head at the World Economic Forum.

Lisa Ellsman, shared a similar interpretation.

“Rather than the government saying ‘you have to use this kind of technology to stop your drone,’ they would say, ‘your drone needs to be able to stop in so many seconds,’” she said.

This gives the drone operators flexibility to build drones around performance targets, vs. “prescriptively requiring a certain type of technology,” according to Ellsman.

Rwanda is still working out the implementation of its performance-based regulations, according to MiTEC’s Claudette Irere. They’ve entered a partnership with the World Economic Forum to further build out best practices. Rwanda will also soon release an online portal for global drone operators to apply to test there.

As for Rwanda being first to release performance-based regulations, that’s disputable. “Many States around the world have been developing and implementing performance-based regulations for unmanned aircraft,” said Leslie Cary, Program Manager for the International Civil Aviation Authority’s Remotely Piloted Aircraft System. “ICAO has not monitored all of these States to determine which was first,” she added.

Other governments have done bits and pieces of Rwanda’s drone policy, according to Timothy Reuter, the head of the civil drones project at the World Economic Forum. “But as currently written in Rwanda, it’s the broadest implementation of performance based regulations in the world.”

Commercial Use Cases

As the UAV programs across Africa mature, there are a handful of strong examples and several projects to watch.

With Zipline as the most robust and visible drone use case in Sub-Saharan Africa.

While the startup’s primary focus is delivery of critical medical supplies, execs repeatedly underscore that Zipline is a for-profit venture backed by $41 million in VC.

The San Francisco-based robotics company — that also manufactures its own UAVs — was one of the earliest drone partners of the government of Rwanda.

The alliance also brought UPS and the UPS Foundation into the mix, who supports Zipline with financial and logistical support.

After several test rounds, Zipline went live with the program in October, becoming the world’s first national drone delivery program at scale.

“We’ve since completed over 6000 deliveries and logged 500,000 flight kilometers,” Zipline co-founder Keenan Wyrobek told TechCrunch. “We’re planning to go live in Tanzania soon and talking to some other African countries.”

In May Zipline was accepted into the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Pilot Program (UAS IPP). Out of 149 applicants, the Africa focused startup was one of 10 selected to participate in a drone pilot in the U.S.– to operate beyond visual line of sight medical delivery services in North Carolina.

In a non-delivery commercial use case, South Africa’s Rocketmine has built out a UAV survey business in 5 countries. The company looks to book $2 million in revenue in 2018 for its “aerial data solutions” services in mining, agriculture, forestry, and civil engineering.

“We have over 50 aircraft now, compared to 15 a couple years ago,” Rocketmine CEO Christopher Clark told TechCrunch. “We operate in South Africa, Namibia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and moved into Mexico.”

Rocketmine doesn’t plan to enter delivery services, but is looking to expand into the surveillance and security market. “After the survey market that’s probably the biggest request we get from our customers,” said Clark.

More African use cases are likely to come from the Lake Victoria Challenge — a mission specific drone operator challenge set in Tanzania’s Mwanza testing corridor. WeRobotics has also opened FlyingLabs in Kenya, Tanzania, and Benin. And the government of Zambia is reportedly working with Sony’s Aerosense on a drone delivery pilot program.

Africa and Global UAV

With Europe, Asia, and the U.S. rapidly developing drone regulations and testing (or already operating) delivery programs (see JD.com in China), Africa may not take the sole position as the leader in global UAV development — but these pilot projects in the particularly challenging environments these geographies (and economies) represent will shape the development of the drone industry.

The continent’s test programs — and Rwanda’s performance-based drone regulations in particular — could advance beyond visual line of sight UAV technology at a quicker pace. This could set the stage for faster development of automated drone fleets for remote internet access, commercial and medical delivery, and even give Africa a lead in testing flying autonomous taxis.

“With drones, Africa is willing to take more bold steps more quickly because the benefits are there and the countries have been willing to move in a more agile manner around regulation,” said the WEF’s Reuter.

“There’s an opportunity for Africa to maintain its leadership in this space,” he said. “But the countries need to be willing to take calculated risk to enable technology companies to deploy their solutions there.”

Reuter also underscored the potential for “drone companies that originate in Africa increasingly developing services.”

There’s a case to be made this is already happening with Zipline. Though founded in California, the startup honed its UAVs and delivery model in Rwanda.

“We’re absolutely leveraging our experience built in Africa as we now test through the UAS IPP program to deliver in the U.S.,” said Zipline co-founder Keenan Wyrobek.","south africa namibia ghana ivory coast

Twitter will now put live streams and broadcasts started by accounts you follow at the top of your timeline, making it easier to see what they’re doing in realtime.

In a tweet, Twitter said that that the new feature will include breaking news, personalities and sports.

The social networking giant included the new feature in its iOS and Android apps, updated this week. Among the updates, Twitter said it’s now also supporting audio-only live broadcasts, as well as through its sister broadcast service Periscope.

Last month, Twitter discontinued its app for iOS 9 and lower versions, which according to Apple’s own data still harbors some 5 percent of all iPhone and iPad users.","broadcasts

The code exploits a weakness in iOS’ web rendering engine WebKit, which Apple mandates all apps and browsers use, Haddouche told TechCrunch. He explained that nesting a ton of elements — such as <div> tags — inside a backdrop filter property in CSS, you can use up all of the device’s resources and cause a kernel panic, which shuts down and restarts the operating system to prevent damage.

“Anything that renders HTML on iOS is affected,” he said. That means anyone sending you a link on Facebook or Twitter, or if any webpage you visit includes the code, or anyone sending you an email, he warned.","sabri haddouche

The reviews for the show were almost uniformly negative, yet they didn’t quite prepare me for the terribleness of the initial episodes, which alternate between feeble attempts to mine humor from hot-button issues like sexual assault and suicide, and even feebler attempts to treat those issues seriously.

To help me figure out just what makes this show so bad, I was joined by Original Content‘s original co-host, Darrell Etherington. Our ultimate question: Is this the worst thing we’ve watched for the podcast? (Yes.)

We also discuss the fact that Henry Cavill has been cast as the lead in Netflix’s adaptation of the “Witcher” video game franchise.

This episode was actually recorded more than a week ago, but I didn’t get time to edit it until after Disrupt SF. So much has happened since then — like “The Witcher”‘s showrunner leaving Twitter and Cavill apparently departing the role of Superman. (Plus, somehow, “Insatiable” has been renewed for a second season.) Still, the initial news gave us an opportunity to weigh the relative merits of the “Mission Impossible” movies, and to discuss my favorite subject, Superman’s invisible mustache in “Justice League”.

If you only have one smart home device, it’s likely something simple and fun like a voice-controlled speaker or color-changing LED light bulb. As you expand your smart home setup, you can begin to swap out gear that isn’t as flashy but you still use everyday.

Switching to connected locks, power outlets and smoke alarms are all simple installs that can improve your safety and comfort in your own home. We’ve pulled together some of our favorite essentials made smart for anyone looking to upgrade.

Smart lock: Kwikset Kevo Smart Lock 2nd Gen

The Kwikset Kevo Smart Lock 2nd Gen is the most versatile smart lock that we’ve tested. Whether you prefer to use a wireless fob, smartphone app or key, you’ll be able to control the lock with all of them. When we compared it to similar models, the Kevo’s Bluetooth-activated tap-to-unlock mechanism was the easiest to use.

The second generation of the Kevo improved on security and has all-metal internal components for better protection against forced break-in attempts. With the optional Kevo Plus upgrade, you’ll add the ability to control the lock remotely and receive status-monitoring updates.

Robot Vacuum: iRobot Roomba 960

If cleaning is neither your forte or preferred pastime, a robot vacuum will come in handy. Our upgrade pick, the iRobot Roomba 960, is one of the most powerful models that we tested. It can be controlled through the iRobot Home app and uses a bump-and-track navigation system that helps vacuum an entire floor without missing spots.

If its battery is running low during a session, it’ll return to its dock to power up before finishing the job. It’s easy to disassemble for maintenance and is equipped with repairable parts that make it worth its price over some of our less serviceable picks.

Plug-in Smart Outlet: Belkin Wemo Mini

We tested 26 smart outlet models over more than 45 hours and chose the Belkin Wemo Mini Wi-Fi plug as our top pick. If you’ve ever thought it’d be nice to remotely turn on or off home essentials such as lamps, air conditioners and fans from your smartphone, plugging them into a smart outlet makes it possible.

The Wemo Mini has proven to be reliable throughout long-term testing, it doesn’t block other outlets on the same wall plate and it’s compatible with iOS and Android devices and assistants, including HomeKit/Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. The interface of the Wemo app is intuitive and easy to use. You can view all of your connected devices on one screen, set powering timers and from anywhere power on or off a device plugged into the Wemo outlet.

Smart Thermostat: Nest Thermostat E

For a smart thermostat that’s affordable and doesn’t require extensive programming, we recommend the Nest Thermostat E. After about a week, it creates a schedule after learning cooling and heating preferences that you’ve set. It isn’t compatible with as many HVAC systems as similar Nest models, but it’s easy to install and doesn’t lack any features we expect.

It does come with Eco Mode — an energy-saving geofencing feature that detects when your home is empty (or when your smartphone is nowhere near your house). The Nest app uses the same technology to set the thermostat to a preferred temperature when it senses you’re on your way home. If you don’t have your smartphone on hand, you can still operate the Thermostat E by turning its outer ring and pressing selections on its touchscreen.

Smart Smoke Alarm: Nest Protect

A smoke alarm is one of the most relied-upon safety devices in every home. Nonetheless, it’s easy to forget to do routine checks to ensure it’s in tip-top shape and functioning properly. With a smart smoke alarm like the Nest Protect, we found that its simple app, self-tests, monthly sound checks and consistent alerts are enough to keep fire safety worries at bay.

It isn’t difficult to install, has a sleek design and integrates with other smart home devices like the Nest Cam (which can record video of a fire) and the Nest Learning Thermostat (which shuts down HVAC systems that may be the cause of a fire). It’s sensitive to fast- and slow-burning fires, plus it monitors homes for both smoke and carbon monoxide.

The quality, camera performance and overall capability of the iPhone XR is high, and while it's a little chunkier that shouldn't put many people off.

The iPhone XR is going to be the undercover hit of the Apple launch - there, we’ve said it.

That’s not because it does anything particularly wonderful, but because it’s going to be the more accessible version (price-wise) of the fancy iPhone XS.

The presence of the XR shows that the days of a physical home button is over - that’s going to worry some people, but now all the new iPhones launched are using this all-screen design with Face ID facial recognition to unlock your phone.

But here’s the big question: is it the one you want to upgrade to? Apple has made some compromises to drop the price, so will you still feel like you’re getting enough for your money?

What's the difference between the three new iPhones? Watch our handy explainer below:

Below you'll find links to all of our other iPhone and Apple hands on reviews from the big event...

In terms of the iPhone XR release date, you’ll be able to pre-order it from October 19, and pick it up in stores from October 26.

That's later than the September 21 release date of the iPhone XS and XS Max, which are both available to pre-order now.

The price of the iPhone XR is something that’s going to attract buyers: at $749 for the 64GB model ($799 for 128GB and $899 for the 256GB) it’s far more affordable than the iPhone XS, which is taking all the headlines from Apple’s launch event.

Design

All the rumors around the iPhone XR in the build-up to the launch event was centered around how this would be the ‘affordable’ member of the new line-up… meaning it became known as something that could be a gross hybrid of Apple’s parts, a Frankenstein’s monster of a device.

iPhone XR specs Weight: 194g

Dimensions: 150.9 x 75.7 x 8.3mm

OS: iOS 12

Screen size: 6.1-inch

Resolution: 1792 x 828

CPU: A12 Bionic

Storage: 64/128/256

Rear camera: 12MP

Front camera: 7MP

Colors: Blue, White, Black, Yellow, Coral, Red

Resistance: IP67

Well, unsurprisingly for a brand that puts such a focus on design (and whose chief designer was flipping knighted) it’s not an ugly device in any way.

Next to the iPhone XS, sure - it’s not quite as attractive. It’s got thicker bezels around the screen, the edges aren’t made of the same premium-feeling materials, and the back is still glass.

But as a standalone device it looks just fine - it could easily be mistaken for the iPhone X of last year if the two devices weren’t held closely.

The size is obviously larger than the iPhone XS / X, thanks to that larger 6.1-inch display that needs to be wrapped in metal and other assorted components.

It still feels like an iPhone in the hand, something that has the curved edges that fall away from the side of the screen, and the two speaker grilles at the bottom of the iPhone XR (even though only one is actually functioning).

It certainly feels chunkier than the other two models that were launched by Apple at the same time - but not in a terrible way and is a fine tradeoff for the cost.

There’s no headphone jack there as you can imagine - Apple still bravely battling against the tyranny of the 3.5mm connector - so you’ll be stuck using the bundled earbuds in the box, which come with a Lightning connection at the end.

You should be able to use your own 3.5mm-shod headphones with an adaptor - but we’re hearing rumors that will be taken from the box this year, in a bid to cut costs, so we’ll have to see if that plays out.

The rest of the iPhone XR’s design is predictable if you’ve seen the iPhone X or checked out pics of the new XS, with the same buttons for the volume and to activate Siri on the left- and right-hand side of the phone respectively.

It’s hard to put a price on how much a phone costs just by feel these days - largely because they’re so much more expensive - but the ‘cheap’ iPhone certainly doesn’t feel that way and actually impresses quite profusely compared to the XS.

Screen

In the build-up to the iPhone launch, much of the talk was around the screen of the iPhone XR. It was going to be 6.1-inches, have thicker bezels and use LCD technology over OLED to keep the costs down.

Well, it seems that has indeed come to pass, with the new Liquid Retina display that Apple’s developed for the model. What that means is that although it’s technically lower quality - HDR playback isn’t present here, for instance - the color reproduction and overall screen effect isn’t that bad at all.

After all, Apple’s been using LCD technology in its iPhone range even last year (where rivals like Samsung have eschewed the tech) so it knows how to make a decent-looking LCD display.

A phone with a screen this big obviously feels larger in the hand - you definitely get the sensation that this is a plus-size phone - but it doesn’t feel unwieldy due to the fact the display stretches from edge to edge.

There is one thing to note for those upgrading from older iPhones: there screen ratio is close to 18:9, which is a narrower than the usual 16:9 widescreen that many will be used to.

This is really only an issue when using apps or watching movies in landscape, as that little notch at the top (housing the cameras, speaker and sensors) will get in the way when you decide to fill the screen with content.

While that will be quite rare, it’s probably worth noting as some people were irked by the notch-notion with last year’s iPhone X.

Camera

The camera on the iPhone XR is the weakest of the three phones announced by Apple - it’s only got a single sensor rather than two for portrait mode, but that doesn’t mean it’s terrible quality in comparison and it’s the same as the one in the XS, just lacks the second lens.

It more means that you won’t be able to have a telephoto lens for lossless zooming in, or be able to take clever portrait modes using the two sensors together, as you can with the iPhone XS pair announced (although with the Focus pixels, it can do depth sensing and blurring the background. It works rather nicely, considering it’s ‘faked’.

You can also then change the depth of the blur effect with a scroller on the bottom of the phone - Apple is claiming it’s the first brand to do this, but we’ve seen it plenty of times on handset like the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus, so it’ll be interesting to hear where Apple sees the difference.

It’s a 12MP sensor on the rear, with the front packing the TrueDepth camera for facial unlocking and selfies, and while Apple didn’t make a big deal about the functionality on stage it’ll be equally as good as that seen on the iPhone 8 last year, which was far from terrible.

It’s also got Smart HDR in the mix, allowing the iPhone XR to really capture the high-end elements of a photo, fusing the light and dark elements well in the demo pictures we saw.

In our very rapid testing in the demonstration area, the pictures we took were clear and sharp and colorful - but that’s largely because all smartphone cameras are more than half-decent these days.

It seems that if you just want a camera that can take a nice picture when needed, and no fancy bells and whistles, the iPhone XR will do you just fine.

Battery

While we don’t know the full spec list for the iPhone 9, there are a few good reasons to think that the iPhone XR could have better battery life than expected.

Apple’s likely put a little less RAM in here alongside the A12 Bionic chipset, combining less power with a more efficient engine. The screen resolution on the iPhone XR will also be likely a little less too - although LCD technology is sometimes more power-hungry than OLED.

We’ll need to properly test the iPhone XR to see if its battery life can hold up to scrutiny - we’ve been burned by iPhones not lasting as well as we’d like in the past, but the larger size of this phone does mean Apple could have shoved a little bigger power pack inside.

Early verdict

The cheaper iPhone is never the most interesting one, but it’s often the volume driver - and you could make a good few arguments that the iPhone XR will do just that.

However, the decision to make it larger is an odd one: this is a phone that perhaps is better suited to the Asian market (where bigger screens are more popular), which could be an issue for Western buyers.

The lack of a smaller, iPhone SE sequel is what people will be wondering about - but it’s clear that Apple had decided bigger is better, shaving off some of the more expensive elements of the iPhone XS and bringing it together in this still-impressive package.","and

Gareth Beavis,These are our early impressions of the new device from Apple - check back in a few hours (or keep an eye on our Twitter feed) to see when we've had time to deliver some more in-depth findings. The Apple Watch 4 is something that both smartwatch and fitness en… [+7473 chars],The Watch many will have been waiting for,2018-09-12T20:38:19Z,techradar,Hands on: Apple Watch 4 review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-watch-4,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qx99EqDMhzeG7uH5zYFykh-1200-80.jpg,technology,2018-09-16 14:23:31.214622,"This is a really impressive upgrade from Apple – if you're thinking of getting yourself a Watch from the brand, we'd suggest you start thinking about this one. Given that the display is the only real upgrade, you could say there's not much of a change; but it really makes a difference, and the smart health stuff is going to make this more attractive to those who take a keen interest in their wellbeing. Looks like Grandpa might be getting an Apple Watch...

The Apple Watch 4 is the first big upgrade to the device that the brand has thrown our way for a number of years - in fact, never since the launch of the first model years ago have we had anything different.

We spent some decent time with the new device at the Apple launch event recently and have added in some extra thoughts based on our time in the demo area - there are a few new features to trawl through in this new wrist-piece.

The Apple Watch 3 recently lost its title of best smartwatch in our rankings to the Samsung Galaxy Watch – so what can the Watch 4 (or Apple Watch Series 4, to give it its full title) bring that might propel it back to the top of the charts?

Below you can catch up on the Apple Watch 4 news with our handy video roundup

Below you'll find links to all of our other iPhone hands on reviews from the big event...

The Apple Watch 4 is coming in four variants: 40mm and 44mm sizes, and with or without LTE.

In terms of the Apple Watch 4 release date, we’re looking at September 14 for pre-orders, but September 21 if you want to actually get this thing on your wrist.

The GPS-only version will start at $399 / £399 / AU$599 for the smallest version, launching in 26 territories. The cellular option will be $499 / £499 / AU$749 and is coming to 16 markets. We’ll update this section with more pricing and availability info as we get it.

If you're looking for a contract with the LTE watch, you'll be looking at carriers like AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile in the US. EE offers deals for the LTE version of the watch as it did for the Apple Watch 3 in the UK, plus Vodafone now offers deals for the first time.

Design and screen

The new Apple Watch 4 in 44mm and 40mm sizes.

If you asked most people what upgrade they’d like on their Apple Watch, most would say they’d either like it to be round, or to have a large display.

Well, they’re not going to get the former, no matter how many patents for more rounded designs Apple holds, but the latter has come to pass.

The design of the Apple Watch 4 is much like many would expect: it’s based on the previous four models (the first Watch was retooled and re-released, remember), but now is ever so slightly larger, as you can see in the side-by-side picture below.

The 42mm Apple Watch 3, left, and 44mm Apple Watch 4, right

That means you’re getting a rectangular OLED display with rounded edges that curve away and towards the wrist.

The same quick (ish) release straps are back – it would be something of a surprise if they disappeared given the Watch band ecosystem Apple has built up around them – and the heart rate monitor is present at the back of the device (more on that later).

The digital crown, the spinning dial that allows you to flick through lists and hit ‘enter’ when clicked in, is back (with a red-ringed version denoting that the Watch 4 has LTE connectivity) and above / below that (depending on which wrist you have the device on) is the power / multi-tasking button.

It's also now haptic, meaning that you can scroll it and get a vibrating 'tick' every time you scroll past something on the screen - it's a really useful upgrade that makes using the scrolling crown more useful, and there's even a slightly audible click as it rolls around.

Image 1 of 3 Image 2 of 3 Image 3 of 3

Everything feels polished, well-made and light enough on the wrist. The rear of the Watch is even ceramic and sapphire to add that little bit of glitz to proceedings and make sure that cellular signal can get through well – and it’s really visually striking when you see it for the first time.

The speaker and microphone have been moved a little too, so the speaker can be 50% louder without getting mic interference - not that you'll be using it all the time, but it's a more useful way of conducting a call in the car or something.

But let’s get onto that screen! A new thing! A visual change to the Apple Watch, finally!

The change here is that the screen has been shoved to the edges of the Watch, so no more ugly black bezels around the sides of what you’re looking at.

Saying that, many apps used a black background already so it was quite hard to see the border, but with the larger screen you can see so much more information. Also, there is still that border - it's as much edge-to-edge as the iPhone XR is.

Apple has used this to good effect, allowing more complications on the watch faces so that you can see more information at a glance – it’ll be interesting to see how long it takes for third-party apps to be re-tooled to make full use of the display’s extra space.

There are multiple new watch faces on offer here as well - Apple has been crafting new 'beautiful' scenes to display on the handset as well as new complications thanks to the larger space - for instance, you can tag in friends and have a one-tap screen that gives easy access to calls and messages.

The Apple Watch 4 is still using the same OLED technology as before, and still doesn’t have that ‘always-on’ display that many would like – you still need to raise your wrist to wake it, and while we couldn’t test this in multiple scenarios in the demo area (for example sitting, standing, lying in bed), in the past the reaction to a raise has always been pretty good from Apple’s wristwear.

The screen is strong, dynamic and colorful, and the new Watch faces really add to the mix. There’s so much more you can do to accessorize it, and while it doesn’t look any brighter it really impresses the eye just by being larger.

Fitness

The Apple Watch has been gaining in prowess as a fitness device over the years, incorporating ever-more sophisticated tracking for your runs and cycles, connecting to separate gym equipment and monitoring you through more activities.

All that is on offer here, but the fitness smarts have been augmented in a couple of ways. The main one is the improved heart rate monitor, and while that won’t be of interest to many there are plenty of people out there that do want more medical insights, and that’s where Apple is aiming this device.

We know someone with diabetes, and if the Apple Watch ever became capable of monitoring blood glucose he’d buy it straight away.

The Apple Watch 4 has an improved tracker for checking how your ticker is beating, using an ECG (electrocardiogram) monitor to give better readings in a medical scenario. It’s still not certified as a medical device, of course, but it can give better notifications of things that you might want to get checked out.

We couldn’t test that just yet – the feature isn’t coming to the US for a month or two, and will roll out elsewhere later – so the basic heart rate monitor looked, well, basic.

The overall functionality of the heart rate monitor, when just generally exercising, should also be improved, which will be very much welcomed by fitness aficionados, as the Apple Watch has never been the best at reading your pulse when it's being bashed about during exercise.

WatchOS 5 is also added in, which means more automatic exercise tracking - but that's something coming to the whole range of Apple Watch devices in the near future.

Battery

The battery life of the Apple Watch 4 is improved once more, thanks to the presence of the new S4 chipset inside creating more efficiency, and (presumably) to Apple finding a way to cram a little more battery into the space by further shrinking other components.

Apple now claims that its Watch 4 battery life is staying strong at 18 hours for ‘all-day’ use, although that's a bit of a disappointment, and keeps it behind the levels claimed by others like Samsung or more dedicated running devices.

However, for some reason Apple seems to underplay its battery life – when it first claimed 18 hours on a single charge we found it would last a little longer. Plus you can now go for six hours in GPS mode, which is going to make it appealing to more marathon runners.

However, with a more impressive heart rate monitor and the presence of GPS for tracking on the go, along with connecting to your phone to show notifications, there’s a lot for this watch to do .

The charging setup is the same as before: you’ve got the wireless, but magnetically-connected, charger that clips onto the back of the Watch 4 – this is a pretty strong link despite using magnets, so you’ll rarely knock the watch off it during the night.

Early verdict

The Apple Watch does bring some upgrades, and the biggest and most important is to that display. Finding a way to put more information on the display is a big enhancement here, and will entice more users by bringing more information to their wrist.

It’s good that Apple has managed to retain the same form factor while making the screen bigger, and the mix of the fitness and more health-related features will broaden the attraction of owning an Apple Watch.

The lack of dedicated apps remains an issue – brands aren’t exactly rushing to put their wares on the Watch, and some older apps are being discontinued – but as a standalone device Apple has definitely improved its wristwear in 2018.","electrocardiogram

While this pattern should almost be a given at this point, it’s no less disappointing.

However, between Apple keeping to a very mobile-centric show and other rumblings in the silicon world, we can imagine two key reasons as to why there weren’t any new Macs announced alongside the new Apple Watch 4 and iPhone XS .

One of these things is not like the others

We’re well past the days of Apple launching a half dozen products at once. As of late, Apple has been much more focused on presenting a focused lineup within a specific category. Now this time around, the Cupertino-based company took that idea to its most extreme by only announcing four new products.

Apple will likely hold a keynote just for new MacBooks and Mac desktops – hopefully in October – after all, Apple computer products have been long overdue for a solo showcase. In fact, the last time a Mac was given stage time was when Apple introduced the iMac Pro at WWDC 2017 last June.

Although both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro were just refreshed with Coffee Lake processors in July, the announcement was given little fanfare compared the grand reveals new iPhones and Apple Watches are given.

Not the right time yet

It makes even more sense for Apple to hold back on these announcements if you look at the state of the world of components, which is very much in flux.

On the mobile front, Intel just introduced new Whiskey Lake and Amber Lake processors, which are reportedly experiencing shortages that could have pushed back a new MacBook announcement . This isn’t great timing for Apple to at last become current with the latest processors like it has with the new MacBook Pro, as Intel is reportedly running into 14nm supply problems across the board.

Then, the realm of desktop components is an even greater state of flux. Looking at Apple’s history, it usually prefers Intel processors, but Coffee Lake Refresh processors still seem months away; and AMD for graphics, which hasn’t really seen any new parts in the last year except for the Radeon RX Vega 56 Nano .

Despite this seemingly ongoing hold on any big new Mac releases, Apple has made promises to deliver a new Mac Mini and Mac Pro 2019 . We just hope it will make good on its vows before the end of this year – or even the next year.","cupertinobased

The new gold color impresses, the speaker volume is good and the display is still one of the best on the market. But it does feel very similar to last year...

When it launched last year, the iPhone X was something the phone-buying public sorely wanted: the chance to get their hands on a new style of handset from Apple.

That need was filled, so this year we weren’t expecting anything as impressive – and that’s been the case with the new iPhone XS.

Update: iPhone XS pre-orders are now open!

Confusing name aside, the new phone is largely similar to last year’s model, but with some key upgrades: there’s now 512GB of storage, an all-new A12 Bionic chipset to improve the speed and camera performance, and an enhanced display.

What's the difference between the three new iPhones? Watch our handy explainer below:

Below you'll find links to all of our other iPhone and Apple hands on reviews from the event...

The iPhone XS is now available to pre-order in most countries around the world, with the handset going on sale globally from September 21 if you want to pick it up from a store.

In terms of price, the good (ish) news is that the cost hasn't risen over last year’s incredibly expensive iPhone X, with the 64GB iPhone XS price coming in at $999 / £999 / AU$1,629.

The 256GB iPhone XS price is $1,149 / £1,149 / AU$1,879, and the 512GB iPhone XS price is $1,349 / £1,349 / AU$2,199.

That said, while the cost of rival smartphones has been going up, the iPhone XS is still going to be one of the most costly phones you can buy (apart from the iPhone XS Max, which will have the eye-watering price tag of $1,099 / £1,099 / AU$1,799).

Design

As we said, the main thing that excited people last year was the all-new design, and Apple’s staying true to form and making this an ‘S’ year – that means the same design, with only a few tweaks inside to mark this out as a different phone.

iPhone XS specs Weight: 177g

Dimensions: 143.6 x 70.9 x 7.7mm

OS: iOS 12

Screen size: 5.8-inch

Resolution: 2436 x 1125

CPU: A12 Bionic

Storage: 64/256/512GB

Rear camera: 12MP + 12MP

Front camera: 7MP

Colors: Silver, Space Grey, Gold

Resistance: IP68

The main change is to the color scheme: this year we’ve got a gold shade thrown into the mix, which we have to say looks rather striking in the flesh.

Beyond that, the same frame as last year is present: a steel frame around the edge, a 5.8-inch display encapsulated by thin bezels all the way around, and (unsurprisingly) no home button, with the notch at the top of the display housing all the components required for the Face ID facial recognition for unlocking the phone.

The glass front and back are here once again too, and despite not really changing anything year on year, Apple has still delivered one of the more striking smartphone designs on the market.

When we say striking we're not talking about the look – there are an absolute slew of iPhone copycats on the market now from Asian firms, and many offer a similar design – but the build quality. The feel of the iPhone in the hand still conjures a premium feeling, going some way to offsetting that sky-high price.

In the hand, it’s very hard to feel there’s much different between the iPhone X and iPhone XS from last year – the gold coloring aside – but you still get a real feel that this is one of the most premium smartphones on the market, and that more durable glass on the back doesn’t diminish the feeling at all.

Compared to the iPhone X, it really is identical though - the chances of anyone noticing the difference are miniscule as there really aren't any.

Some will be disappointed to learn there's no 3.5mm headphone jack-to-Lightning port adaptor in the box, as there has been with phones since the iPhone 7. You can still buy these from Apple for $9 / £9 if you need one.

The iPhone XS does come with the bundled Lightning connector earbuds, which many people will choose to use and so won’t miss the dongle.

On the left-hand side of the phone (and, for that matter, the right-hand side too) things are much as expected: the volume buttons and silencer rocker switch remain on the left, and the larger lock / Siri button sits proudly on the right of the phone, jutting out just enough to be used effectively without ruining the flow of the rim.

The iPhone XS is water-resistant to IP68 rating, an improvement on the X which means you can slosh it about in the bath or shower without a care in the world, and there are dual speakers on the top and bottom of the device.

They don’t both fire forward (the bottom one spits sound downwards from the edge of the phone), which is still a shame if you're trying to watch a film without headphones, but they’re still impressively loud – Apple has improved the output this year to make them even more dynamic and rich-sounding, and although it was hard to fully test this out in the demo area at the launch event there does seem to be a definite improvement in sound quality, with the bass especially feeling more robust.

Screen

Again, the iPhone XS hasn’t really changed much in terms of the screen it’s offering. The 5.8-inch OLED option is back once again, and that was already one of the best screens we’ve seen on a phone in the last year, delivering rich colors, deep blacks and strong contrast ratios.

There’s still the aggravating notch at the top of the phone, housing the front-facing cameras and speaker, and while you’ll probably get used to this in a week or two there are some films or YouTube videos that you’ll want to expand to fill the whole screen, and you'll lose a touch of picture there.

Apple has improved the performance of this screen by adding 60% better dynamic range to the already-offered HDR 10 and Dolby Vision movies – this basically improves the quality even further by managing to make both bright and dark elements of the scene rich and clear, without just driving the brightness right up and ruining the overall quality.

We played Ready Player One - a visually rich experience - and as you'd expect, the color reproduction and clarity between the light and dark scenes was pretty impressive.

Watching HDR video on the screen we didn’t instantly feel like it was miles better, but it was engaging and deep – we just remember having the same kind of reaction last year.

Also just scrolling around the device a pleasant experience, and the speed was phenomenal thanks to the new A12 Bionic chipset.

Apps opened and closed in a flash, the camera fired up instantly, and while we took an age to load a Bethesda game (Elder Scrolls Blaze) the overall quality when we got into it was great, and really does offer the feeling that you’re getting console quality on a smartphone (despite it being a touch juddery to run through – although this is an unreleased game).

The overall graphical quality of Blaze was really impressive when it came to the visuals, but we really need to test the graphical prowess of the phone to see where it's made big steps ahead.

Camera

While there are some minor refinements to the camera on the iPhone XS, there are nowhere near as many as some might have expected, once again highlighting how this is very much an ‘S’ year for the iPhone range.

It’s good to get dual cameras on the ‘normal-sized’ iPhone – last year’s iPhone 8 only had a single sensor – but perhaps there could have been more added to the mix.

There are two 12MP sensors, both with optical image stabilization we believe, although one is a wide-angle lens offering higher-quality low-light performance, and the other a telephoto lens that allows for 2x zoom to get you closer to subjects.

The two can be used together in Apple’s Portrait Mode, enabling you to blur backgrounds and allowing you to change the lighting or add effects to the subject with a few simple swipes.

You can also change the depth effect of the bokeh from within the app - there's a neat 'dot' where Apple things you should be scrolling to, but you have control too.

What has been upgraded is this phone's capability to understand and improve photos through its onboard smarts: it can now dynamically work out scenes and enhance overall photo quality algorithmically, as Apple strives to catch up to the photographical prowess of the Google Pixel 2 and Huawei P20 Pro.

Overall, the quality is enhanced, with the new chipset taking in the capability of the A12 Bionic’s Neural engine – as you can see in the photos that Apple showed off on stage, the quality is incredible.

Testing the camera in the demo area, things were super-crisp and clean, but we’d expect that in bright conditions. We'll need to spend more time trying it out in more challenging environments to find out more.

Battery

As ever, Apple doesn’t announce the size of its battery on stage, preferring to talk about what its phones can actually do. The iPhone X last year had a capacity of just over 2,700mAh, but could generally last the day pretty well.

Apple is claiming that the iPhone XS, with its new, more efficient A12 Bionic chipset inside, is capable of lasting 30 minutes longer than the iPhone X – which doesn’t seem that much, and makes us inclined to believe that it’s the chipset doing so much more that’s the reason for the low jump.

There’s wireless charging in the mix too (we assume, although Apple never mentioned it), based on the Qi standard, and we’ve found with any phone that’s capable of wireless charging that if you head out and buy a couple of power pads for work and home we doubt you’ll actually run out of battery very often at all. The back is still glass, so there’s no worry that the charging signal won't get through.

There’s no fast charger in the box from Apple it seems, as it wasn’t mentioned, which is a missed opportunity when you consider rivals like Samsung and OnePlus have been offering that functionality with the cost of the phone for years.

There aren’t many huge strides forward in battery life on the iPhone XS, but that’s hardly surprising given it has the same frame, with little room to shove in more battery capacity.

Early verdict

There’s always something so disappointing about the ‘S’ years of the iPhone – sure, it makes business sense for Apple given it can still command sales without having to redesign the phone every time, but without a new shape it’s not as easy to explain to buyers why it’s worth buying.

There are some decent improvements in the mix – notably the capacity, the louder speakers and the more colorful screen – but beyond that many will likely be torn between last year’s iPhone X, which will now be cheaper, and having the latest iPhone, as we can’t say the upgrades we saw were plentiful or overpowering. The iPhone XR seems more of an impressive feat from Apple, to be honest.

There’s a real snap to using the iPhone XS in the hand, and it’s capable of being held easily with one palm. The edges still being steel make us worry that it’ll scratch like the X managed to, so you certainly may want to consider a case, as these phones were already hoovering up fingerprints in the demo area.

We’re looking forward to getting our teeth into this handset over the next few weeks, and we'll bring you our full iPhone XS review with all the details you need to know before deciding whether to take the plunge.","jacktolightning

Christine Blasey Ford, now a 51-year-old professor at Palo Alto University in California, described an incident between the two in high school, alleging that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed one summer in the 1980s and forced himself on her.

Ford told the Post that Kavanaugh ""groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.""

She also said Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream for help.

“I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” Ford said. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.”

Kavanaugh last week denied the allegations, which were first reported last week.

""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,” Kavanaugh said in a statement provided by the White House. “I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”

The White House reportedly provided the same statement to the Post on Sunday.

Ford told the Post that Kavanaugh and a friend, Mark Judge, were both “stumbling drunk” when they took her into a bedroom while they were at a house in suburban Maryland. Judge and Kavanaugh were both students at Georgetown Preparatory School.

Judge and Kavanaugh pushed Ford onto a bed in the room, where rock-and-roll music was playing at a high volume, Ford alleged.

According to her, Kavanaugh “held her down with the weight of his body and fumbled with her clothes, seemingly hindered by his intoxication,” the Post reported. She added that both of the boys were laughing “maniacally.”

Ford was able to escape when Judge jumped on top of her and Kavanaugh and broke them up, she said. She said she then locked herself in a nearby bathroom for five or ten minutes before leaving the house.

Judge told The Weekly Standard last week that the allegation against Kavanaugh is ""just absolutely nuts.""

Ford told the Post that she hasn’t spoken with Kavanaugh since the alleged incident and didn’t tell anyone about it until 2012, when she discussed it in couple’s therapy.

The Post reviewed the therapist’s notes, which reportedly don’t mention Kavanaugh’s name but say that Ford was attacked by students “from an elitist boys’ school” who would become “highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.”

Republicans in the Senate have said they expect Kavanaugh to be confirmed to the Supreme Court before October.","christine blasey ford

""We believe that the depositions that we took, I think nearly about 70 people, those need to be published and they need to be published I think before the election,"" Nunes said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

""I expect to make those available from our committee to the American public in the next few weeks,"" he added.

Nunes's comments come days after his colleague, Rep. Trey Gowdy Harold (Trey) Watson GowdyGowdy: House Intel panel should release all transcripts from Russia probe Conservatives blame McCarthy for Twitter getting before favorable committee House Republicans say Ohr interview escalates surveillance concerns MORE (R-S.C.) called for the documents' release on Wednesday, thought he remained silent on Gowdy's remarks at the time.

""There is something that has not been released that I think would be beneficial for the public to see — and that would be all of the transcripts from all of the [House Intelligence Committee] interviews,” Gowdy told The Hill on Wednesday.

“There are no national security implications there,” he added. “There are no sources and methods there.”

The Republican lawmakers' calls echo House Intelligence Democrats who have repeatedly asked for the documents to be made public. GOP and Democratic lawmakers backed plans to release the transcripts before Republicans announced this spring that they would be wrapping up their investigation.

GOP lawmakers questioned whether making the interview transcripts public could impact their ability to compel witnesses to testify in future investigations.

“The majority has said they support making these transcripts public,” the committee's top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), said in March. “We will put to the test of whether they really do.”

Nunes added Sunday that ""70 or 80 percent"" of the depositions are already unclassified documents. For the remaining classified interviews, Nunes said, he will reach out to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats Daniel (Dan) Ray CoatsThe Hill's Morning Report — Sponsored by Better Medicare Alliance — Cuomo wins and Manafort plea deal Hillicon Valley: North Korean IT firm hit with sanctions | Zuckerberg says Facebook better prepared for midterms | Big win for privacy advocates in Europe | Bezos launches B fund to help children, homeless Bipartisan trio asks US intelligence to investigate ‘deepfakes’ MORE, which he expects to ""take a matter of days.""

Asked if he thought the president would declassify the relevant documents, Nunes said he thinks Trump ""doesn't have any choice.""

Manafort, who was convicted last month in Virginia on charges of bank and tax fraud, reached a deal on Friday to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller Robert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE and avoid a second trial on additional charges in Washington, D.C.

The White House and Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have downplayed the potential impact Manafort's deal may have on the president.

Trump's lawyers and Manafort's legal team had a joint defense agreement, meaning the two sides shared information. Giuliani declined to comment on whether a pardon was possible for Manafort, though he has said in the past such an offering would come after Mueller's investigation is ended.

Schiff said Sunday that other potential witnesses who could be implicated in Mueller's probe should take note of Manafort's change in legal strategy after being convicted in Virginia.

""This sends a message to anybody who’s in Bob Mueller’s crosshairs right now, you better get to the special counsel and make your deal right now,"" he said. ""The longer you wait to come clean, the worse deal you’re going to get.""","paul manafort paul john manaforttrump republicans

The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) announced in March that all new elephant trophy hunting permits would be considered on a case-by-case basis going forward, but permits from hunters hoping to ship home tons of elephant parts and tusks are still pending.

ADVERTISEMENT

Of the 21 individual permits submitted to FWS between January 2017 and March 2018 for imports of elephant trophies from the two countries initially banned by the Obama administration — Zimbabwe and Zambia — not one has received a response, according to data released under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

Dwight Miloff, a frequent trophy hunter, told The Hill he hasn’t heard anything from FWS regarding the permit he submitted in May 2017 for an elephant he killed that year. Miloff, a resident of Billings, Mont., and a member of Safari Club International (SCI), said he booked his trip to Zimbabwe and submitted his permit in anticipation of the administration overturning the ban on elephant trophy imports.

“The bottom line is they are afraid as shit to get off the fence,” he said of the administration's failure to approve or deny the permits. “They know if they get off the fence the anti-hunting people will be up in arms, and if they don’t grant them the people who put in the money for the permit will be pissed off.”

FWS says the permits remain “under review,” but a number of experts in the sports hunting field, as well as individual hunters awaiting approval to ship back their trophies, say they believe the administration has informally delayed a decision on elephant trophies as a result of Trump’s November tweet.

Applicants for elephant trophy permits in countries like Tanzania and South Africa that weren’t banned by the Obama administration received prompt responses from FWS, with most being accepted, The Hill’s review of the data showed. But the majority of elephants available to hunt are found in the formally banned countries: Zimbabwe and Zambia.

Former FWS acting Director Greg Sheehan first announced the administration’s plan to reverse the Obama-era ban on elephant imports while at a SCI event in Tanzania on Nov. 14.

Following almost instantaneous public backlash, Trump tweeted three days later: “Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts. Under study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you!”

The president’s son is a member of the Boone and Crockett Club and has been photographed holding both elephant and leopard trophies.

Trump’s tweet stunned members of the big-game hunting community.

“His sons shoot elephants, I don’t know why I can’t,” said Bradley Martin of San Antonio, Texas, who is awaiting a response from FWS on two permits he submitted to hunt elephants in Zimbabwe in 2017 and 2018.

Martin said he was led to believe by those in the industry that the Trump administration would favor trophy hunting. He timed both his trips to make sure they would occur after Trump took office.

""Everybody said that he had agreed,” he said, referring to favorable changes to trophy hunting rules.

Internal emails released through a previous FOIA request additionally show officials issued a hard stop on granting permits after Trump’s tweet.

“Until we get additional clarification on the intent and breadth of the President’s decision to review ‘Big game Trophy decision,’ we have been asked to abstain from issuing any permits for both lions and elephants,” Sheehan told top staff the day after Trump’s tweet.

Bob Oliver, a hunter from Terrebonne, Ore., who submitted a trophy permit application this March to hunt a Zimbabwe elephant at the end of September, said he was told by FWS officials he communicated with that the permits would not be ruled on anytime soon.

“What it really boils down to, and this was after several exchanges I had with them, is that they weren’t going to be issuing any permits under this administration,” he told The Hill. “And that’s where they left it.”

Oliver said he’s now faced with the decision of whether to continue with his plans to fly to Africa for the hunt knowing he might not be able to bring back any trophies. He said that canceling the trip would mean losing thousands of dollars on a deposit.

“I was given the impression from some of the things that was said that they were going to evaluate on a one-by-one basis, and I wanted to get first in line,” he said. “So I made a deposit with an outfitter. When I got that last message that they weren’t going to be issuing any permits because of the situation with the administration, I’m going to forfeit $30,000 if I cancel the hunt.”

“I’m not very happy about it,” he added.

John Jackson, president of Conservation Force — a group that advocates for wildlife conservation through hunting — said Trump’s reversal, and his administration’s subsequent inaction, is having a negative impact on the animals' natural habitat in the banned countries.

“When somebody comes along and impulsively decides he’s going to stop all imports of all elephant trophies, last November, he not only threatens hunters — that’s a small price to pay — he’s threatening habitat,” Jackson said.

“He’s threatening the loss of lions, and prey and most of the habitat that hunting pays for,” Jackson added. “The whole thing is in free fall.”

He noted that trophy hunts can cost about $70,000, with much of that money going toward African communities that rely on revenue from hunting.

Jackson, who is a member of the Interior Department’s controversial International Wildlife Conservation Council, said he’s spent his life trying to help preserve African elephant species. He said that while the concept of hunting as preservation is lost on many people, he thought the president was on board with the approach.

“I voted for him, but I can’t talk to him,” Jackson said. “The FWS is not processing imports from permits. They are sitting there because they have a presidential tweet. It’s not science based.”

But not everyone is pessimistic about the relationship between hunters and the administration.

A representative for SCI said the group has seen signs that the administration is more receptive than previous presidencies to the needs of big game hunters.

“What I am looking at is the bigger picture,” said Anna Seidman, director of litigation at SCI. “This is not what we saw back in 2014 when we saw FWS saying … ’We are ignoring the countries, we are ignoring the hunting community and we are just going to shut it down.’ ”

Seidman said that while individual hunters might not see the changing trends as favorable, the permit approvals will likely follow.

But for many hunters — and Trump voters — waiting years to take home their prizes, the situation looks nothing but bleak.

“Well, I voted for him, I can’t say I’m enthralled with the whole thing,” said Martin, who has two elephant trophies waiting in storage in Africa. “I don’t even know what to expect anymore out of these people.”

Nevertheless, he said he still plans to go on the hunt he has booked for this month in Zimbabwe.

“If I’m successful it will be two or three trophies over there for me,” he said. “Maybe one day I’ll get them, maybe I won’t.”","international wildlife conservation council

The confluence of factors has jolted the Democrats with a fresh burst of confidence, and they are growing increasingly confident that the House is theirs for the taking after eight years in the minority.

“Getting out of town is probably a good thing for them.”

Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to capture the Speaker’s gavel — a seemingly heavy lift — but they have history on their side.

The party controlling the White House has lost seats in 36 of the 39 midterm cycles going back to the Civil War. The average loss, according to the analysts at Sabato’s Crystal Ball, an election handicapper at the University of Virginia, is a whopping 33 seats.

Democrats, though, see signals well outside of civics textbooks that are fueling the optimistic sense that they’ll control the chamber next year for the first time since they were clobbered at the polls in 2010.

The most recent generic poll, a gauge of how voters feel about the parties without naming individual candidates, found the Democrats with a 14 point advantage — an enormous gap predicting the House would likely flip.

“There’s clear energy and momentum on our side,” Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (N.M.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), told reporters Thursday.

Democrats also have a fundraising advantage heading into the final stretch.

At the end of the second quarter, the DCCC had out-raised its GOP counterpart by almost $43 million.

The figure reflects a remarkable show of support for Democratic newcomers challenging Republican incumbents: by mid-summer, more than 50 Democratic challengers had out-raised the sitting Republicans they’re hoping to oust.

Bustos said she raised a total of $2.1 million during her first election to Congress in 2012. This year, she said, some Democratic candidates are raising that much in a quarter.

“I feel great. We’ve got great candidates, the best candidates I’ve ever seen in my political lifetime,” Bustos said. “You can feel the enthusiasm in every district where we go.”

Republicans are quick to dismiss the notion that a Democratic wave is in the making.

They’re touting the booming economy as a product of their making — and a reason voters will keep them in the majority.

That attack has taken off since June, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self labeled Democratic Socialist, defeated Democratic Caucus Chairman Joseph Crowley (D) in a shocking primary contest in New York.

“Democrats nominated the most progressive group of candidates we’ve ever seen in battleground districts,” Jesse Hunt, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said Friday in an email.

“Mainstream voters have no appetite for Nancy Pelosi regaining control of the House to pass a progressive agenda centered around abolishing ICE and single-payer health care.”

The attacks on Pelosi are hardly new, but they’ve been escalated this year as Republicans have sought to link virtually every Democratic candidate to the veteran leader — a San Francisco liberal and a household name loathed by many conservative voters.

The strategy has clear limitations: Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) shrugged off such attacks to win a deeply conservative district in a special election in March. And Pelosi on Friday brushed aside the notion that the strategy will be effective.

“I’m OK with it,” she said

Unavoidably, President Trump will play an outsized role in the midterms. And if recent polls are any indication, Democrats have another reason to be feeling bullish.

One much-watched gauge is the RealClearPolitics polling average, which has seen Trump’s approval rating fall more than 2 points in recent weeks, while his disapproval numbers have increased by almost the same amount. One new poll, from CNN, put his approval rating at 36 percent.

Perhaps the surest sign of the Democrats’ increasing confidence is this: no longer are they talking about what they might do if they win the House; they’re talking about what they will do.

Meanwhile Pelosi, in a letter to her troops earlier this month, revealed that the senior Democrats on all the committees are already drafting legislation to get a jump on 2019. The heading of the letter sent a clear message: “Be Ready!”

“As we approach the end of this Congress, we must Be Ready for the prospect that we will be in the Majority in January,” the letter reads.

Despite the surge of optimism, Democrats say they’re also well aware that, in electoral politics, nothing is a slam dunk.

There are still more than seven weeks to go before Election Day, and the pace of the news cycle all but ensures the political landscape will shift over that span. With that in mind, Democrats have a singular goal ahead of November: Just win the House.

“If this environment remains, this is obviously a favorable environment for us,” Kildee said. “But we can’t assume it will.”","democratic congressional campaign committee dccc

“I am calling on Senate Republicans to delay next week’s Judiciary Committee vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh,” the number two Senate Democrat wrote in a tweet.

“The American people deserve to know who Judge Kavanaugh is, but Republicans are trying to rush through this nomination while concealing critical parts of the nominee’s record,” he added in another tweet. “There are far too many questions swirling around this nomination.”

Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have pressed for the release of documents from Kavanaugh’s work as a staff secretary for former President George W. Bush and more than 100,000 pages of documents that the Trump administration asked to withhold.

Republicans so far have blocked those efforts.

Democrats have also accused Kavanaugh of misleading the Senate Judiciary Committee during his committee hearing earlier this month as well as during a hearing more than a decade ago for his confirmation to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

“Kavanaugh provided misleading or inaccurate answers to many questions,” Durbin wrote in another tweet Saturday. “And Republicans are hiding documents for 35 months when he was a top advisor to President Bush and worked on controversial issues like abortion, torture, warrantless wiretapping, and banning same-sex marriage.”

Durbin also said Saturday on Twitter that “we must respect and listen to survivors of sexual assault.” Kavanaugh was recently accused of sexual misconduct when he was in high school, an allegation he has denied.

“If the #MeToo movement has taught us anything, it is that we must respect and listen to survivors of sexual assault, regardless of the age of those involved or when the alleged attack took place,” Durbin said.","senate judiciary committee

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerDemocrats should end their hypocrisy when it comes to Kavanaugh and the judiciary Celebrities back both Cuomo and Nixon as New Yorkers head to primary vote Dems launch million digital ad buy in top Senate races MORE (D-N.Y.) made the pitch publicly to undecided Republicans, arguing that during his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh “evaded” questions, gave “totally unsatisfactory” answers or, in some cases, “offered misleading testimony” and “shaded the truth” about his work in the George W. Bush White House.

“I urge my colleagues on the other side to scrutinize Judge Kavanaugh’s comments to the Judiciary Committee … and decide for yourself whether he was completely forthcoming,” Schumer said during a Senate floor speech Wednesday.

“Because if a nominee provides false or misleading testimony to a committee that should weigh heavily, very heavily on the minds of every senator when it comes time to vote, to confirm or reject the nominee,” Schumer said.

The White House has dismissed the comments from Democrats as an attempt to “smear” Kavanaugh.

But Democrats argue that Kavanaugh’s testimony, as well as “confidential” documents released after the hearing, show that he wasn’t truthful about his work in the Bush White House, where he served as an associate counsel and staff secretary.

“Time and again, on issue after issue, Judge Kavanaugh has misled the Senate, under oath, when a job promotion was on the line. That is disqualifying,” Sen. Patrick Leahy Patrick Joseph LeahyDemocrats should end their hypocrisy when it comes to Kavanaugh and the judiciary Senate approves first 2019 spending package Durbin accuses Kavanaugh of misleading senators in 2006 hearing MORE (D-Vt.), a former committee chairman, said when he announced his opposition to Kavanaugh.

If confirmed, Kavanaugh, 53, is expected to tilt the court to the right for decades.

Leahy said he had “never been more concerned” about a Supreme Court nominee’s “willingness and unwillingness to be truthful under oath.” He made the remarks as part of the Senate Democratic weekly address released on Friday.

The allegations from Democrats are just part of a swirl of eleventh-hour drama that has roiled the final weeks of Kavanaugh’s nomination.

Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsDems play waiting game with Collins and Murkowski Jay Leno dedicates patriot award to McCain Crowdfunding campaign raises .3M urging Collins to vote against Kavanaugh MORE (R-Maine), one of a handful of undecided centrists in both parties, has seen her staff field “vulgar” calls over the nomination. Her office on Thursday received a cardboard cutout in the shape of male genitalia with words “f--- you and the donor class you rode in on” written on it.

Kavanaugh’s nomination, meanwhile, is entrapped in the midst of a sexual misconduct allegation over reports of a letter detailing an alleged incident between Trump’s nominee and an unidentified woman, when they were both in high school.

Kavanaugh said Friday that he “categorically and unequivocally” denies the allegation, which liberal outside groups opposed to the nominee say should block his confirmation.

Democrats, who have otherwise been eager to lambast Kavanaugh, have been silent on the letter, instead focusing on the policy and political implications of confirming Trump’s second Supreme Court nominee.

Kavanaugh’s nomination is scheduled to come to the Senate floor by the end of the month.

Democrats can’t block Kavanaugh’s nomination on their own. Democrats would need to win over Collins and one other GOP senator, and keep their own caucus united to prevent his confirmation.

Democrats have focused their allegations, in large part, on Kavanaugh’s work on controversial Bush-era judicial nominations.

Cory Booker Cory Anthony BookerOpposition to Kavanaugh devolves into farce Overnight Energy: Warren bill would force companies to disclose climate impacts | Green group backs Gillum in Florida gov race | Feds to open refuge near former nuke site Former Virginia Gov.

Kavanaugh told senators during his circuit court confirmation hearing that Pickering was “not one of the judicial nominees that I was primarily handling.”

Separately, White House spokesman Raj Shah said that “nothing whatsoever in these emails” contradicts that Kavanaugh wasn’t “primarily” handling the nomination.

Several emails released by Booker, however, show Kavanaugh discussing Pickering's nomination with his colleagues, taking part in meetings with Senate staff and drafting an op-ed for a separate Bush administration official defending Pickering.

Wade.

Kavanaugh, as part of written answers given to the committee, said he was not the primary handler of that nomination for the Bush administration either.

Shah said Democrats are trying to argue that Kavanaugh having any discussions on a nominee is the same as being the primary person responsible for the nomination within the White House counsel's office.

“Dems are dishonestly conflating being the WH Counsel lead responsible for ‘handling’ the nomination with any discussion of the nomination whatsoever. It’s a complete and total smear with no basis,” he said.

“What it is it worth for these witnesses to stand before our committee, raise their hand and take an oath, if they then turn around and say things that are not true to us and are not held accountable. Is there any credibility in this committee?” Durbin asked his colleagues during a heated Judiciary Committee meeting.

Durbin wanted to subpoena White House documents on the issue but was blocked by Republicans. Kavanaugh has said he wasn't read in on the programs and pointed, as proof, to the fact that he isn't mentioned in the Senate Intelligence Committee's so-called torture report. Feinstein's office has countered that the report ""does not address whether Judge Kavanaugh was telling the truth.""

It’s unclear if Democrats can convince moderate senators that Kavanaugh was untruthful. None of the five senators considered swing votes have publicly raised red flags about the issue.

Collins told the Portland Press Herald after Kavanaugh’s hearing that if he “was not truthful, then obviously that would be a major problem for me.”

Collins had a one-hour phone call with Kavanaugh on Friday, but her office declined to discuss details of the call.

“That’s been brought to my attention basically, a couple of things that they were concerned about. We’re looking into that to see if there’s any credibility to it,” Manchin said.

Manchin added that during their late July meeting Kavanaugh seemed “very forthcoming and very open,” but if there is “evidence” that Kavanaugh misled senators that would be “devastating … [but] it’s also just as erroneous to jump to a conclusion.”","charles schumer charles chuck ellis schumerdemocrats

While introducing her husband, Jill Biden told a childhood story about a confrontation with a neighborhood bully, and appeared to make the comparison to the president.

“There is nothing that makes either of us more angry than a bully,” Jill Biden said. “There’s nothing that’s more unfair or unjust than people using their power to try to make other people feel small, to tell them who they are or what they are capable of, to say their identity doesn’t belong.”

She added that the two wanted to “pick a fight” with bullies, a comment seen as a subtle hint at a possible Biden challenge to Trump in 2020.

Joe Biden also compared Trump to a bully.

“The president uses the White House as a literal, literal bully pulpit, callously exerting his power over those who have little or none,” he said in his remarks.

The former vice president also said that he wished he and former President Obama had spoken out against Trump sooner.

“Barack and I agreed we would be quiet for the first year to let the new administration get up and running,” Biden said. “God forgive me.”

“What has become of us?” he added later. “Our children are listening and our silence is complicit.”

Biden has spoken out against Trump on a number of occasions, fueling speculation that he is gearing up for a White House bid.

A poll last month found Biden leading Trump by 7 points in a hypothetical 2020 matchup.","joe biden joseph joe robinette bidenjay leno

Opinion Contributor

To date, Lisa Page’s infamy has been driven mostly by the anti-Donald Trump text messages she exchanged with fellow FBI agent Peter Strzok as the two engaged in an affair while investigating the president for alleged election collusion with Russia.

Yet, when history judges the former FBI lawyer years from now, her most consequential pronouncement may not have been typed on her bureau-issued Samsung smartphone to her colleague and lover.

Rather, it might be eight simple words she uttered behind closed doors during a congressional interview a few weeks ago.

“It’s a reflection of us still not knowing,” Page told Rep. John Ratcliffe John Lee RatcliffeHouse panel advances DHS cyber vulnerabilities bills Hillicon Valley: Trump signs off on sanctions for election meddlers | Russian hacker pleads guilty over botnet | Reddit bans QAnon forum | FCC delays review of T-Mobile, Sprint merger | EU approves controversial copyright law Homeland Security awards massive cyber contract to ManTech MORE (R-Texas) when questioned about texts she and Strzok exchanged in May 2017 as Robert Mueller Robert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE was being named a special prosecutor to take over the Russia investigation.

With that statement, Page acknowledged a momentous fact: After nine months of using some of the most awesome surveillance powers afforded to U.S. intelligence, the FBI still had not made a case connecting Trump or his campaign to Russia’s election meddling.

Page opined further, acknowledging “it still existed in the scope of possibility that there would be literally nothing” to connect Trump and Russia, no matter what Mueller or the FBI did.

“As far as May of 2017, we still couldn’t answer the question,” she said at another point.

I reached out to Page's lawyer, Amy Jeffress, on Friday. She declined to answer questions about her client’s cooperation with Congress.

It might take a few seconds for the enormity of Page’s statements to sink in. After all, she isn’t just any FBI lawyer. She was a lead on the Russia case when it started in summer 2016, and she helped it transition to Mueller through summer 2017.

For those who might cast doubt on the word of a single FBI lawyer, there’s more.

Shortly after he was fired, ex-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyThe #Resistance refuses to acknowledge more damning Strzok texts Don’t blame the FBI — Hillary Clinton was never going to be charged Woodward book: Trump erupted into ‘uncontrollable anger’ over coverage of Mueller appointment MORE told the Senate there was not yet evidence to justify investigating Trump for colluding with Russia. “When I left, we did not have an investigation focused on President Trump Donald John TrumpPaul McCartney slams Trump in new song: 'We've got a mad captain sailing this boat' George Conway rips Trump over tweet about Obama's '57 states' gaffe Pompeo doubles down on criticism of Kerry: The Iran deal failed, 'let it go' MORE,” Comey testified.

And Strzok, the counterintelligence boss and leader of the Russia probe, texted Page in May 2017 that he was reluctant to join Mueller’s probe and leave his senior FBI post because he feared “there’s no big there, there.”

The Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general asked Strzok shortly before he was fired from the FBI what he meant by that text, and he offered a most insightful answer.

Strzok said he wasn’t certain there was a “broad, coordinated effort” to hijack the election and that the evidence of Trump campaign aides talking about getting Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonManafort’s plea deal – the clear winners and losers Kerry: Trump should be worried about Manafort talking to Mueller, not me talking to Iranians Five takeaways from Manafort’s plea deal MORE dirt from Russians might have been just a “bunch of opportunists” talking to heighten their importance.

Strzok added that, while he raised the idea of impeachment in some of his texts to Page, “I am, again, was not, am not convinced or certain that it will,” he told the IG.

So, by the words of Comey, Strzok and Page, we now know that the Trump Justice Department — through Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Rod Jay RosensteinKen Starr: 'Hell to pay' if Trump tries to fire Mueller Legal experts petition judge to unseal Watergate report before Mueller finishes Russia probe Graham to renew call for second special counsel MORE — unleashed the Mueller special prosecutor probe before the FBI could validate a connection between Trump and Russia.

Which raises the question: If there was no concrete evidence of collusion, why did we need a special prosecutor?

Page’s comments also mean FBI and Justice officials likely leaked a barrage of media stories just before and after Mueller’s appointment that made the evidence of collusion look far stronger than the frontline investigators knew it to be. Text messages show contacts between key FBI and DOJ players and the Washington Post, the Associated Press and the New York Times during the ramp-up to Mueller’s probe.

And that means the news media — perhaps longing to find a new Watergate, to revive sagging fortunes — were far too willing to be manipulated by players in a case that began as a political opposition research project funded by Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and led by a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, who despised Trump.

Finally, Page’s statement signals that the nation’s premier intelligence court may not have been given a complete picture of the evidence — or lack thereof — as it approved an extraordinary surveillance intrusion into an American presidential nominee’s campaign just weeks before Election Day.

There was no fault to the FBI checking whether Trump was compromised by Russia; that is a classic counterintelligence responsibility.

The real fault lies in those leaders who allowed a secret investigation to mushroom into a media maelstrom driven by official leaks that created a story that far exceeded the evidence, and then used that false narrative to set a special prosecutor flying downhill ahead of his skis.

No matter where Mueller ends his probe, it is now clear the actions that preceded his appointment turned justice on its head, imposing the presumption of guilt upon a probe whose own originators had reason to doubt the strength of their evidence.

John Solomon is an award-winning investigative journalist whose work over the years has exposed U.S. and FBI intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, federal scientists’ misuse of foster children and veterans in drug experiments, and numerous cases of political corruption. He is The Hill’s executive vice president for video.","rod rosenstein rod jay rosensteinken starr

“Barack and I agreed to remain silent for a while to give this administration a chance to get up and running the first year,” Biden said at an annual dinner held by LGBTQ rights group the Human Rights Campaign. “God forgive me.”

However, Biden said, he couldn’t sit back after the events of August 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia, when a man at a white supremacist rally drove his car through a crowd of anti-racist protesters and killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer.

“We have leaders who at the time when that occurred, when these guys were accompanied by white supremacists and Ku Klux Klan ... making a comparison saying there are good people in both groups,” Biden said. “What has become of us? Our children are listening. Our silence is complicity.”

After the violence in Charlottesville, Trump infamously took no stand at all, claiming there were “fine people on both sides” of the protest and there was plenty of blame to go around.

Biden began publicly denouncing Trump last year, delivering a speech in October 2017 in which he said America was headed down a “very dark path.” Obama, meanwhile, made his first public statements against Trump earlier this month as he began campaigning for congressional Democrats.","charlottesville virginia

By ALLEN G. BREED, Associated Press

NEW BERN, N.C. (AP) — As the death toll from Florence grew and hundreds of people were pulled from flooded homes, North Carolina braced for catastrophic, widespread river flooding that could be the next stage of a mounting disaster.

Weakened to a tropical depression early Sunday after blowing ashore as a hurricane with 90 mph (145 kph) winds on Friday, Florence was still spinning slowly atop the Carolinas as it pulled warm water from the ocean and hurled it onshore.

The storm’s death toll climbed to 14 when a man drowned after a pickup truck flipped into a drainage ditch along a flooded road in South Carolina. Earlier, authorities said two people died from inhaling carbon monoxide from a generator in their home.

About 740,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the Carolinas, and utilities said some could be out for weeks.

Radar showed parts of the sprawling storm over six states, but North and South Carolina were in the bull’s-eye.

The head of Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, said officials were still focused on finding and rescuing people.

“We’ll get through this. It’ll be ugly, but we’ll get through it,” Long told NBC’s “Meet The Press.”

Rivers swelled toward record levels, forecasters said, and thousands of people were ordered to evacuate for fear that the next few days could bring the most destructive round of flooding in North Carolina history.

Stream gauges across the region showed water levels rising steadily, with forecasts calling for rivers to crest Sunday and Monday at or near record levels: The Little River, the Cape Fear, the Lumber, the Neuse, the Waccamaw and the Pee Dee were all projected to burst their banks, possibly flooding nearby communities.

Authorities ordered the immediate evacuation of up to 7,500 people living within a mile (1.6 kilometers) of a stretch of the Cape Fear River and the Little River, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the North Carolina coast. The evacuation zone included part of the city of Fayetteville, population 200,000.

The Defense Department said about 13,500 military personnel were assigned to help relief efforts, which could be massive since river forecasts showed major flooding was likely in towns as far as 250 miles inland.

John Rose owns a furniture business with stores less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the river. Rain-soaked furniture workers helped him quickly empty more than 1,000 mattresses from a warehouse in a low-lying strip mall.

“It’s the first time we’ve ever had to move anything like this,” Rose said. “If the river rises to the level they say it’s going to, then this warehouse is going to be under water.”

On U.S. Route 401 nearby, rain rose in ditches and around unharvested tobacco crops along the road. Ponds had begun to overflow, and creeks passing under the highway churned with muddy, brown water. Farther along the Cape Fear River, grass and trees lining the banks were partly submerged.

Fayetteville’s city officials, meanwhile, got help from the Nebraska Task Force One search and rescue team to evacuate 140 residents of an assisted-living facility in Fayetteville to a safer location at a church.

Already, more than 2 feet (60 centimeters) of rain has fallen in places, and forecasters are saying there could be an additional 1½ feet (45 centimeters) before Sunday is out.

“Floodwaters are rising, and if you aren’t watching for them, you are risking your life,” Gov. Roy Cooper said.

Officials were warning residents not only to stay off the roads but also to avoid using GPS systems.

“As conditions change, GPS navigation systems are not keeping up with the road closures and are directing people onto roads that are confirmed closed and/or flooded,” the state Transportation Department said on Twitter.

Florence weakened to a tropical depression early Sunday and was crawling west at 8 mph (13 kph). At 5 a.m., the storm was centered about 20 miles (35 kilometers) southwest of Columbia, South Carolina. Its winds were down to 35 mph (55 kph).

In Goldsboro, North Carolina, home of Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, roads that frequently flood were already closed Saturday by rushing water. Dozens of electric repair trucks massed to respond to damage expected to hit central North Carolina as rainwater collected into rivers headed to the coast.

On Saturday evening, Duke Energy said heavy rains caused a slope to collapse at a coal ash landfill at a closed power station outside Wilmington, North Carolina. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said about 2,000 cubic yards (1,530 cubic meters) of ash were displaced at the Sutton Plant and that contaminated storm water likely flowed into the plant’s cooling pond.

In New Bern , along the coast, homes were completely surrounded by water, and rescuers used inflatable boats to reach people Saturday.

Kevin Knox and his family were rescued by boat from their flooded brick home with the help of Army Sgt. Johan Mackie, whose team used a phone app to locate people in distress.

“Amazing. They did awesome,” said Knox, who was stranded with seven others.

New Bern spokeswoman Colleen Roberts said 455 people were safely rescued in the town of 30,000 residents.

Spirits were high at the Trent Park Elementary School in New Bern, where 44-year-old Cathy Yolanda Wright took shelter after being rescued from her flooded home Saturday. Wright, who sings in the choir at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist, led residents at the shelter in an energetic singalong.

People clapped and shouted, “Amen!” and “Thank you, Lord.”

Across the Trent River from New Bern, Jerry and Jan Andrews returned home after evacuating to find carp flopping in their backyard near the porch stairs.

Coast Guard helicopters took off across the street to rescue stranded people from rooftops and swamped cars.

The Marines rescued about 20 civilians from floodwaters near Camp Lejeune, using Humvees and amphibious assault vehicles, the base reported.

John Kennedy (R-La.) said Sunday there’s “nothing we can do” about an allegation of attempted sexual assault that a woman made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

The Louisiana Republican, who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is tasked with evaluating Supreme Court nominees, claimed that he and colleagues are unable to properly investigate the allegation because the woman requested anonymity and declined to press the matter further.

“I don’t know what our Democratic friends expect us to do,” Kennedy said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We got a letter, it’s secret. We don’t know who wrote it. Who are we going to cross-examine? [California Sen. Dianne] Feinstein? I mean give me a break.”

However, soon after Kennedy made that statement, Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University in California, came forward as the accuser in an interview with The Washington Post.

Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the committee, said Thursday she had received a letter from the then-unnamed woman detailing her concerns about Kavanaugh after President Donald Trump initially nominated him to the post in July. The woman alleged that he forced himself on her at a party while they were both in high school. Kavanaugh issued a statement “categorically” denying the allegation last week.

Feinstein said she referred the letter to the FBI. The bureau issued a statement Thursday confirming it had received Feinstein’s referral and included it in Judge Kavanaugh’s background file, which every senator is able to view.

Sources close to Feinstein told HuffPost on Friday that the senator was acting out of concern for the privacy of the woman when she referred the matter to federal investigators. The New Yorker also reported that the California Democrat “conveyed to other Democratic members’ offices that the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion, and that Feinstein had ‘taken care of it.’”

The bombshell revelation comes just days before the Supreme Court nominee is set to receive a vote before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Republicans maintain a 11-10 majority. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said that the vote would proceed as scheduled on Thursday.

In a separate interview on Sunday, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), another member of on the committee, said he would review the contents of the woman’s letter. The North Carolina Republican questioned, however, why it never came up during the open or closed portion of Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing earlier this month.

“It really raises a question in my mind about ― if this was material to the confirmation process, why on earth over the past four to six weeks hasn’t it been discussed among the committee members?” Tillis said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, meanwhile, tweeted that the Me Too movement has “taught us” to “respect and listen to survivors of sexual assault, regardless of the age of those involved or when the alleged attack took place.”

The Illinois senator on Saturday called for the Senate to delay a confirmation vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination so it can thoroughly investigate the woman’s allegation.","senate judiciary committee

An estimated 2,975 people lost their lives in the storm and in its aftermath, according to a recently released study commissioned by Puerto Rico’s government and conducted by researchers at George Washington University. Puerto Rico officials adopted the figure as the official number of deaths linked to the storm.

But FEMA administrator Brock Long, when asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” whether his agency accepts that death count, said that “the numbers are all over the place.”

“FEMA doesn’t count deaths,” Long told host Chuck Todd.

Referring to the storm now battering North and South Carolina, he added that “if you take what’s going on with [Hurricane] Florence, the deaths that are verified by the local county coroners are the ones that we take.”

You can’t blame spousal abuse after a disaster on anyone” pic.twitter.com/PcDGCiJyGd — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) September 16, 2018

Trump sparked an intense backlash on Thursday when he accused Democrats of making up “really large numbers” of deaths in Puerto Rico to make him “look as bad as possible.”

No evidence has emerged to support his claim that Democrats had anything to do with the GWU report.

Long, a Trump appointee who assumed office in June 2017, did not condemn the president’s outlandish accusation when asked by Todd if he believes the numerous studies estimating several thousand people died because of Hurricane Maria’s devastation were an effort to hurt Trump’s reputation.

“I don’t know why the studies were done,” Long said. “I think what we’re trying to do ― in my opinion, what we’ve got to do ― is figure out why people die from direct deaths, which is the wind, the water and the waves, buildings collapsing.”

The Puerto Rican government revised Hurricane Maria’s official death toll from 64 to 2,975 last month following the GWU study’s release. Independent investigations conducted separately by The New York Times, Penn State University and Harvard University also estimated Maria’s death toll to be in the thousands.

Experts say counting the number of fatalities in the aftermath of a disaster is critical to understanding which populations are most vulnerable and how to better prepare for future disasters. It’s not uncommon for a death toll to rise in the days, weeks and months after a natural disaster.

Still, Long claimed the studies’ findings on Hurricane Maria were “all over the place” and “frustrating.” He praised Trump’s support for FEMA, adding that the president was being “defensive” about the death toll reports because “he knows how hard these guys behind me work.”

“There’s just too much blame going around,” he added. “And we need to be focused ... on what is Puerto Rico going to look like tomorrow.”

Long is the subject of a Department of Homeland Security inspector general investigation into whether he misused government vehicles and personnel during his frequent drives between his home in North Carolina and FEMA headquarters in Washington. He has denied any wrongdoing.

“Bottom line is if we made ... mistakes on how a program is run, we’ll work with OIG to get those corrected,” he said at a press conference Thursday. “Doing something unethical is not part of my DNA, and not part of my track record and my whole entire career.”

Long on Sunday denied reports that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen wants to replace him.

“Secretary Nielsen has never asked me to resign,” Long told Todd. “We have a very functional and professional relationship.”

Alarmed by the possibility of a bad or “no-deal” Brexit, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for a second referendum on the contentious subject of the U.K.’s departure from the European Union.

In a Sunday Op-Ed published in The Observer, Khan said the British public has the right to “take back control” of the issue after U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s “abject failure” to negotiate a good Brexit deal for the country.

“I’ve become increasingly alarmed as the chaotic approach to the negotiations has become mired in confusion and deadlock, leading us down a path that could be hugely damaging,” Khan wrote.

“The British public should have a say on the outcome of the negotiations” - London Mayor @SadiqKhan calls for second #Brexit vote https://t.co/EB7t1ttrZq #Marr pic.twitter.com/t7KtAS9w8M — BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) September 16, 2018

Britain is to due to leave the European Union at the end of March, but Khan warned the country currently faces two “incredibly risky” options ― both of which could have devastating impacts on the economy and people’s living standards.

“The unfortunate reality is that Theresa May has failed to negotiate a Brexit position with her own party ― let alone agree a deal with the EU,” Khan wrote. “With time rapidly running out, we are left with two possibilities ― a bad deal, which could end up being so vague that we leave the EU blind to what our future relationship will be, or a ‘no-deal’ Brexit.”

“Both these scenarios are a million miles from what was promised during the referendum campaign, only further exposing the lies and mistruths sold to the public,” Khan continued.

A “no-deal” would mean that Britain would exit the EU without a transition period. That would raise a host of questions about trade relations, the Northern Ireland border and the rights and privileges for the millions of citizens of EU nations residing in the UK and vice versa ― UK citizens living in EU countries.

May, who has faced mounting criticism at home over her handling of the Brexit negotiations, has repeatedly pushed back against suggestions of holding a second public vote on the issue.

“To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy ― and a betrayal of that trust,” May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph earlier this month.

But Khan, a member of the opposition Labor Party, argued that May’s government has “looked unprepared and out of its depth” as it’s negotiated with the EU, “resulting in a litany of wrong turns.”

As such, the public “must get a final say” on the issue, Khan insisted. “This means a public vote on any deal or a vote on a no-deal, alongside the option of staying in the EU.”","pictwittercomt7ktas9w8m

KINSTON, N.C. — On Saturday evening, as the Neuse River continued to swell above flood stage and inch closer to the family’s business, Rhoda Rikard stood in the rain and spray-painted a piece of plywood that covered one of the store’s front windows.

The words, in white paint, were the ones this community of about 20,000 people rallied around in the wake of Hurricane Matthew, which brought devastating flooding to the area less than two years ago: “Kinston Strong!”

“Every time something big like this pops off, everybody kind of comes together,” Rhoda’s husband, Kendall, said.

For the past two days, the Rikards had worked to prepare the family flooring business for the flooding unleashed by Hurricane Florence. They stacked wood flooring, rolls of carpet and even their forklift on top of cinder blocks, keeping them several feet off the warehouse floor. Dozens of people from the community called to offer help, Kendall said.

During Hurricane Matthew, in October 2016, the store was inundated with about three feet of water. The Rikards took a big hit, but they recovered. They remodeled the showroom, which now includes a blue chair rail around the perimeter where the flood-damaged drywall had to be torn out.

The family didn’t think they would be going through this again so soon. But they’ve accepted what will likely take place over the next few days. And they’re anxious for it to pass so they can rebuild, once again, and move on with their lives.

Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost Kendall Rickard walks through the warehouse of Southland Flooring and Design, where he and Rhoda placed all products on cinder blocks in an effort to keep them above the coming floodwaters.

“Luckily, we got the hookup on flooring,” Kendall said with a laugh.

After making landfall Friday morning near Wilmington, Florence stalled over the Carolinas. As of midday Sunday, the storm ― downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical depression ― had caused the deaths of at least 14 people, The Associated Press reported, and dropped more than two feet of rain in places. Rain continues to fall across much of the region, causing devastating flooding. The Neuse River, which runs right through Kinston on its way to Pamlico Sound, is forecast to crest on Wednesday at between 11 and 14 feet above flood stage. The worst flooding “is yet to come” for parts of North and South Carolina, the National Weather Service said Saturday night.

Jeano’s Beauty & Barber was among a handful of Kinston businesses still open Saturday. Jeano Farlow, the owner, said he doubts this type of flooding is something anyone can get used to. But after two big events in as many years, he wonders if it’s the “new norm.”

“It looks like it’s going to be something you can always look forward to,” he said.

Authorities closed the highway Saturday between Kinston and New Bern, located at the confluence of the Neuse and Trent rivers, because of the flooding. New Bern is one of the towns hit hardest by Florence thus far.

Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost Jeano Farrow stands at the front door of Jeano's Beauty & Barber in downtown Kinston, North Carolina. The shop stayed open on Saturday as the Neuse River rose about a mile to the south.

Junior Lor, 32, gazed out over the fast-moving Neuse on Saturday from just outside his hotel room in Kinston. He could have easily thrown a rock into the water. The New Bern resident came here several days earlier with his wife and two children, as Florence neared the Carolina coast.

The water was low when Lor checked into the hotel on Wednesday, but rose rapidly on Friday and Saturday. Now he wondered whether he should evacuate again.

Lor still hadn’t heard whether his home in New Bern had been damaged. He was unable to reach neighbors, and said power outages had probably kept them from charging their phones.

Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost Junior Lor, after evacuating from New Bern, North Carolina, looks out from his hotel in Kinston at the rising Neuse River on Saturday afternoon.

The storm surge in Pamlico Sound left downtown New Bern underwater. Hundreds of residents had to be rescued from the floodwaters. On Saturday, heavy rain triggered a mandatory evacuation in Fayetteville, southwest of Raleigh. Fayetteville Mayor Mitch Colvin said people refusing to leave should “notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible.”

“Please, be serious about it,” he said in a news conference. “The worst is yet to come. Now go to the hills, because as soon as the floods will increase, you will be hard to get to save.”","huffpost kendall rickard

By the time Lehman Brothers filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history on Sept. 15, 2008, the country had been navigating stormy global financial waters for more than a year. Bear Stearns had been rescued in a bailout-facilitated merger with JPMorgan Chase, and the government had nationalized housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For anyone paying attention to the financial system, the situation had been quite dire for a long time.

And yet throughout the mess, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury had been permitting the largest banks in the country to funnel as much cash as they wanted to their shareholders ― even as it became clear those same banks could not pay their debts. Lehman itself had increased its dividend and announced a $100 million stock buyback at the beginning of 2008. Insurance giant AIG paid a dividend of $4.40 per share, the highest in company history, on Sept. 19, 2008 ― three days after the Federal Reserve handed the insurance giant $85 billion in emergency funds. According to Stanford University Business School Professor Anat Admati, the 19 biggest American banks passed out $80 billion in dividends between the summer of 2007 and the close of 2008. They drew $160 billion in bailout funds from the U.S. Treasury, and untold billions from the Fed’s $7.7 trillion in emergency lending.

When poor people engage in such activity, we call it looting. But for the princes of American capital and their lieutenants at the Fed and the Treasury, this was pure crisis management.

Today, Ben Bernanke, Hank Paulson and Timothy Geithner insist they did what they had to under conditions of extreme duress. Mistakes were made, the government’s former top financial overseers acknowledge in a recent piece for The New York Times, but they did ultimately “prevent the collapse of the financial system and avoid another Great Depression.”

Except they didn’t really rescue the banking system. They transformed it into an unaccountable criminal syndicate. In the years since the crash, the biggest Wall Street banks have been caught laundering drug money, violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and Cuba, bribing foreign government officials, making illegal campaign contributions to a state regulator and manipulating the market for U.S. government debt. Citibank, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and UBS even pleaded guilty to felonies for manipulating currency markets.

Not a single human being has served a day in jail for any of it.

The financial crisis that reached its climax on that Monday morning 10 years ago was not fundamentally a problem of capital, liquidity or regulation. It was a crisis of democracy that taught middle-class families a grim lesson about who really mattered in American society ― and who didn’t count.

The failures of the crash and the bailout were not technocratic failures. They were about power. University of Georgia law professor Mehrsa Baradaran

For most of American history, financial policy was a central political battleground. There was the feud between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton over Revolutionary War debt; the Whiskey Rebellion; Andrew Jackson’s assault on the Second Bank of The United States; the greenbacks Abraham Lincoln issued to help finance the Civil War; William Jennings Bryan and the cross of gold; the creation of the Federal Reserve; FDR’s New Deal. These were among the most heated political issues of their day. And they were all understood to be questions of power and democratic accountability, not merely matters of growth or efficiency.

But beginning in the 1950s, the United States increasingly came to understand finance as apolitical ― something best handled by technocratic experts insulated from the passions of a democratic electorate. This idea went by different slogans ― “the liberal consensus,” “the great moderation,” “central bank independence” ― but they all amounted to the same thing: The economy was nonideological. The decisions made by experts tending to the financial machine were were strictly tactical. Any mistakes were a matter of pulling the wrong lever or setting a dial too high.

The financial crisis exploded this myth. “The failures of the crash and the bailout were not technocratic failures,” says University of Georgia law professor Mehrsa Baradaran. “They were about power.”

Lehman would be the only major American financial institution to out-and-out fail in the crisis. Everyone else was bailed out on generous terms that not only protected their creditors, but their shareholders and ― with the exception of AIG ― the jobs of their top executives. Criminals who broke the law were shielded from prosecution.

Here’s what happened to everyone who didn’t work for a bank: As a percentage of each family’s overall wealth, the poorer you were, the more you lost in the crash. The top 1 percent of U.S. households ultimately captured more than half of the economic gains over the course of the Obama years, while the bottom 99 percent never recovered their losses from the crash.

These were policy choices, not economic inevitabilities. Under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the government saved the financial sector by pumping it full of cash, and then taking unprecedented steps to elevate the value of financial assets. For anyone who owned stocks and bonds (otherwise known as rich people), this was great news.

But there was no similar commitment to housing ― where middle-class people held their wealth. Instead, over 7.7 million homes were lost to foreclosure between 2007 and 2016, while millions more found the source of their savings ― home equity ― wiped out.

It could have been different. When Obama took office, he promised to spend up to $100 billion from the bank bailout to prevent foreclosures. He ultimately spent just $21 billion. But the dollar amount was only a fraction of the failure. The bailout gave the government unprecedented authority over the foreclosure process ― it could have required banks to adjust monthly payments or reduce debt burdens for homeowners in distress. Instead, as Geithner put it, the foreclosure relief plan was designed to “foam the runway” for banks coming in for a hard landing. It allowed banks to slow down the pace of foreclosures, but did not actually help families keep their homes.

Geithner hadn’t set the dials wrong. He had made a choice about who deserved the government’s full attention and how aid would be distributed. And he had done it without any meaningful input from Congress, or even a public debate.

“It led to a breakdown and a lack of trust in institutions,” says Admati. “What we witnessed here … is kind of ominous. It raised a lot of questions about who controls society ― corporations or the elected government.”

Eric Vidal / Reuters Far right nationalists like Hungary's Viktor Orban have a seen a resurgence in Europe and the United States, fueled by bailout-and-austerity packages crafted by technocratic leaders.

Financial crises foment authoritarianism. In 2015, a trio of German economists studied financial panics in 20 advanced economies dating back to 1870, and concluded that they almost always result in major gains for “far right” political parties after a lag of a few years. The most pressing question for policymakers facing a banking meltdown is not, “How do we restore our banks to profitability?” but, “How can we prevent social collapse?”

And on this front, the technocrats at the top of American government failed every bit as thoroughly as their counterparts in Europe. By crafting bailout-and-austerity packages that protected German and French banks while imposing direct hardship on everyone else, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and German Chancellor Angela Merkel sent a very clear message about whom the European Union really represents.

The result has been a predictable and terrifying resurgence of authoritarian politics unseen since the Second World War. In Greece, it takes the form of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn. In Italy, it has taken power as the Five Star Movement. In Austria, it is the Freedom Party; in Hungary, the government of Viktor Orban. And in the United States, it has manifested in the presidency of Donald Trump.

There’s an obvious paradox in the American plotline. Trump is part of a rising international authoritarian tide, but the financial crisis disproportionately hammered black and brown families. How did it empower a white nationalist presidency?

On average, black and Hispanic families lost fully half of their net worth in the crash. The racial wealth gap expanded during the recovery, as black housing wealth was obliterated. At the peak of the housing bubble, almost half of all mortgages to black families were subprime loans, and foreclosures were heavily concentrated in black neighborhoods. By 2013, median black family wealth had fallen to just $13,487, according to the Urban Institute. Even in 2016, it had only recovered to $17,409, about one-tenth the median white family wealth of $171,000.

The paradox has a simple answer. In America’s two-party system, black frustration with the Democratic Party registers as low voter turnout, while white people angry with the Democratic Party turn into Republicans. An increasingly racist GOP doesn’t offer much to black families, so they stay home on election day, while plenty of white Democrats were either willing to hold their nose and vote for Trump, or found his demagoguery more appealing once Democrats had privileged the concerns of banking elites over the middle class.

For incorrigible optimists, there are some signs of improvement in the banking sector a decade after its near-death experience. Banks have more capital than they used to, a new regulatory agency now exists to help protect families from abusive financial products, and the complex derivatives at the heart of the 2008 crash now have to be traded through clearinghouses.

There’s less here than meets the eye. Offshoring loopholes enable banks to hide their derivatives trades. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is being systematically gutted by the Trump administration. And banks aren’t really carrying all that much more capital. When Lehman failed, it was carrying debt equal to 31 times its total equity. This leverage amplified Lehman’s profits during good years, but it also amplified its losses in a bad year. The new rules from the 2010 Dodd-Frank law are an improvement, but they still allow 20-to-1 leverage. The Volcker Rule banning banks from making risky securities trades for their own accounts has never fully taken effect, and under a new proposal from Trump regulators, never really will.

But even debates over these rules miss the point. The crisis wasn’t just a breakdown of regulatory oversight. It was a failure of the democratic process, of economic management as an apolitical, technocratic field. When people don’t feel included in the most important decisions affecting their basic livelihood, they lose faith in democracy itself.","international monetary fund the european central bank

Will They Set a Record in November?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/14/us/women-primaries-house-senate-governor.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/us/women-primaries-house-senate-governor-promo-1536944976675/women-primaries-house-senate-governor-promo-1536944976675-facebookJumbo.png,general,2018-09-16 14:23:31.214622,"“When women run, women win.” That’s been the line on getting more women into public office; if only there were more candidates, there would be more elected.

So with a record 256 women running for the House and Senate this year, will there be a record-breaking surge of women in office come January?

Probably, probably not, and maybe. It depends on which office you’re following, and what happens in toss-up races over the next seven weeks.

This has definitely been a historic year so far: The 2018 midterms have broken the record for the number of female candidates who filed as well as for the number and share of women who won primaries in House and Senate contests. The number of women winning primaries for the governor’s office is also the highest ever, and the share is the highest since 2000.

Share of general election candidates who are women HOUSE SENATE GOVERNORS 32% 29% 22% 1994 1994 1994 2018 2018 2018 HOUSE SENATE GOVERNORS 32% 29% 22% 1994 1994 1994 2018 2018 2018 HOUSE SENATE GOVERNORS 32% 29% 22% 1994 1994 1994 2018 2018 2018

There are more woman vs. woman contests than ever before: 33, up from a previous record of 19 in 2002 and the single digits in 1992, the so-called Year of the Woman.

The best chances for women to make history are in the House, where Democratic women won primaries at a higher rate than any other group, male or female. Women of color make up one-third of all House candidates, also a record.

Still, it is possible that the number of women will decline or remain at status quo in Congress and in the governors’ offices.

How can that be, when the number of women running has shot up so much?

It is mostly because a majority of female candidates are running in House districts that favor the other party — either running for open seats, or challenging incumbents, who almost always win.

Seats currently held by women Seats currently held by women Seats currently held by women









Currently, women hold of the 435 seats in the House. If a woman won in every race where one is running, would make it to the House. But that’s unlikely. are unlikely to win because they are running against men in districts that favor their opponents’ party. women have a chance, but they are running against men in competitive races (toss-ups or leaning toward one party). That leaves women who will likely hold seats. (This includes mostly incumbents, or other candidates in female-only races or in districts that favor their party.) If only these women win the general election, the number of women in the House would be the same as now.

But if women win all the competitive races and ones where they are favored to win, they will hold 116 seats in the House come January. Still, this is not parity: Even if women win every one of the races with female nominees, they will still occupy fewer than half the seats in the House.

According to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers, half of female nominees in the House are running as challengers, compared with 36 percent of male nominees. Among Democrats, 53 percent of the women in the general election are challengers, compared with 40 percent of men.

“The argument has been: When women run, they’re just as likely as similarly situated men to win,” said Jennifer Lawless, a professor of politics at the University of Virginia (and a former Democratic House candidate in Rhode Island). “It’s not that they’re less likely to win this year — they’re just comprising a lot of the challengers.”

Pennsylvania, the only large state without a woman in its congressional delegation, is guaranteed to have one because two women are running against each other in the suburbs of Philadelphia: Mary Gay Scanlon, the Democrat, is favored over Pearl Kim, a Republican.

Vermont, on the other hand, will most likely remain the only state never to have sent a woman to Congress; it does have its first woman on the ballot this year, but she is a Republican and the seat leans toward the incumbent Democrat.

Two Democrats, Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, are likely to be the first Muslim-American women elected to Congress.

Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota state lawmaker, celebrated her primary victory in August.

The large number of Democratic female nominees in the House reflects the energy of the women’s marches against President Trump and the historic gender gap among the voters who elected him; Republican women set their record in 2010, when the midterm energy was on the right.

“Any Democratic wave is going to disproportionately help women because women disproportionately run as Democrats,” Dr. Lawless said. “If we see 60 seats flip, we are going to see women get elected at unprecedented rates. If the wave ends up more like a puddle on the sand, it’s not going to look that different than previous cycles.”

Kimberly Peeler-Allen, a co-founder of Higher Heights for America, which aims to elect more black women, said Democratic House nominees like Linda Coleman in North Carolina and Lauren Underwood in Illinois, both challenging incumbents in Republican-leaning districts, have been running intense and face-to-face campaigns, which could make them part of that wave.

llinois’s Democratic congressional candidate Lauren Underwood greets guest during a campaign event in June.

“That’s kind of the secret sauce I’ve been seeing,” Ms. Peeler-Allen said. “There’s going to be a lot of movement.”

There are 22 women running in Senate contests this year, up from the previous record of 18 in 2012. Eleven of those women are favored to win — including the six contests where a woman is running against a woman, also a record.

Senate races in which nominees were both women Six races One race 1960 1986 1998 2018 Six races One race 1960 1986 1998 2018 Six races One race 1960 1986 1998 2018

Adding those to the 10 female senators who are not up for re-election, there could be 21 female senators in the next Congress, two fewer than the 23 now serving. But if women win all the competitive races — this includes two Democratic incumbents, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota — there will be 25 women in the Senate, a slight increase but also a record-breaking one.

23 female senators are currently in office 21 women are favored to win or are not up for election 4 are in competitive races 23 female senators are currently in office 21 women are favored to win or are not up for election 4 are in competitive races

It is in the governor’s races that there is the biggest variability. Six women are now serving, and the record was nine, set in 2004. Just three are running in contests that their party is favored to win: two incumbents, Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Kay Ivey of Alabama, and Representative Kristi Noem, who is running for an open seat in South Dakota.

But assume that all of those in competitive races win — this includes Stacey Abrams, a Democrat running in Georgia and Kim Reynolds, the Republican incumbent in Iowa — and you get 10 female governors, again breaking the record by a bit.

6 female governors are currently in office 3 women are favored to win 7 are in competitive races 6 female governors are currently in office 3 women are favored to win 7 are in competitive races

In New York on Thursday, Cynthia Nixon lost her insurgent challenge to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who has already served two terms.

The governor’s offices have long been the hardest for women to win. Twenty-two states have never had a female governor. Four states could have female governors for the first time this year: Maine, Georgia, South Dakota and Idaho.

“We are much more accustomed to seeing women as part of a deliberative body like a legislature,” said Barbara Lee, who started her namesake foundation 20 years ago with the initial goal of getting more women elected to executive office. “When a woman is running to be the C.E.O., voters need more evidence, traditionally, to see that she’s prepared for the role than they do with a man.”

Still, Ms. Lee argued that even if the surge of women who filed to run does not lead to a surge of winners in November, it has changed the dynamics of women running for office.

“From the day of the Women’s March, I felt like, oh my gosh, this is bigger than a moment,” she said. “The energy I saw that day and in the protests following it, this is the time that it can really be a movement that is long lasting.”

But she and others argue that the number of women running this year has been so big that it has changed our image of what a candidate looks like.

This is particularly true for women of color, Ms. Peeler-Allen said, repeating the adage, “if you can see it, you can be it.”","university of virginia

Wind gusts as strong as 120 miles an hour swept through the city, rocking tall buildings and fueling storm swells that threatened the coastline with waves as high as 40 feet.

At midday, the city’s normally teeming streets were devoid of people and cars. The weather authority issued its highest typhoon warning, a signal 10. The government also issued a landslide warning, urging people to stay away from steep hills and retaining walls and asking residents in vulnerable areas to evacuate.

And for the first time ever, Macau, the Asian gambling capital farther along the Chinese coast, closed its casinos because of a storm. Roughly 20,000 households in the territory were left without power, the government said in a statement late Sunday.

Hong Kong residents hunkered down in their apartments, having cleared many grocery store shelves the day before in preparation.

Others took refuge in shelters. The city’s airport, a central transit point for much of Asia, was virtually shut down, with almost 900 flights canceled. The outdoor sections of Hong Kong’s vaunted subway system were taken out of service. In Mong Kok, a crane collapsed at a construction site, but no injuries were reported.

Hong Kongers took to Facebook and WhatsApp messaging groups, circulating pictures of the hurried preparations: cars and motorcycles mummified with cling wrap, indoor storefronts encased with spiderweb-like tape. One Instagram user altered an image to add Spider-Man onto the side of a Hong Kong building, where he’d pitched in by putting tape on a window.

But as the storm bore down in full force, the postings became more ominous. In a city of towering apartment buildings, some reported they were becoming motion-sick as their homes twisted and swayed. Videos showed glass windows and doors smashing, pedestrians being blown off the ground and residents frantically scooping rain out of their balconies to prevent flooding.

China’s southern coast is struck

In southern China, the storm made landfall around 5 p.m. near Jiangmen City, in Guangdong Province, just across the border from Hong Kong. State television reported Sunday evening that two people had been killed, and other reports said that people had been crushed by billboards or other debris in Shenzhen and Dongguan, cities along the Pearl River.

The storm crossed the southern coast with winds as high as 100 miles an hour. As night fell, the cities along China’s southern coast largely emptied as residents heeded warnings to stay indoors, having already stocked up on food and water at stores on Saturday and earlier Sunday. Guangzhou ordered all restaurants to close to keep people off the streets, and high-speed rail service was suspended in the province.

The news agency Xinhua, citing government reports, said that nearly 2.5 million people in the province had been affected in some way, with some seeking protection in more than 18,000 designated shelters. Fishing boats had been ordered before the storm into anchorages, and the authorities detained several fishermen who had defied the warnings.

In Qiantangshan, a coastal village south of the storm’s center, residents seemed unfazed, even though officials said it was the biggest typhoon in years. “It’s not that big,” a woman selling fruit as the first wind and rain arrived had said on Sunday, vowing to stay through the day.

Guangdong, China’s most populous province, has extensive experience with typhoons, and makes elaborate preparations for each of them. After 16 workers were killed when their shanty collapsed in a typhoon in 2003, the province pursued a strenuous campaign of demolishing or upgrading substandard housing.

The broader Pearl River Delta area, which also includes Hong Kong, is one of the world’s most important manufacturing hubs and home to more than 60 million people.

The sprawling delta is barely above sea level and has struggled with flooding despite years of investment in drainage systems. Climate change has exacerbated the problem. The provincial capital, Guangzhou, has more to lose from rising seas and more severe storms than any other city on the planet, according to a World Bank report.

Protecting China’s nuclear plants

The arrival of Typhoon Mangkhut in southern China has raised concerns about the nuclear plants that supply electricity to local manufacturers. But the area is battered by typhoons almost every year, and the Chinese government has stringent standards requiring that all critical infrastructure be able to withstand severe weather.

Workers have been taking precautionary measures at two nuclear plants along the coastline, Taishan and Yangjiang. The first reactor of the Taishan complex went online this past summer, so Typhoon Mangkhut will be its first major storm. The plant’s managers said they had held detailed planning meetings and a thorough safety inspection in the days before the storm.

“All emergency duty personnel of Taishan Nuclear Power have been on the job, all preparations have been implemented, and the Taishan Nuclear Power Base is ready,” they said in a statement on WeChat, a Chinese internet service.

The management of the Yangjiang power plant, which is right on the coast, said in a separate statement on WeChat that it had been designed to withstand large storm surges. Outdoor equipment was tied down or removed to make the site more windproof, and the reactor buildings themselves, which have reinforced concrete shells, are extremely rigid, the company said.

The technology associated with it has traveled a long distance coming from floppy disks, backup CDs and DVDs, then USBs and now to dedicated backup appliances and offsite or remote backup repositories.

Unlike the past, backup technology is now on a completely different scale. The backup market has seen explosive growth over the last few years and a number of reports suggest a stable continuation of the rise in the market growth rate.

According to a Global Forecast about the Data Backup and Recovery market by PRNewswire, published in Dec, 2017: the backup and recovery market is expected to grow from $7.13 billion in 2017 to $11.59 billion by 2022.

Similarly, a market share analysis by Gartner; published in August 2017, states that the backup and recovery software market has displayed accelerated growth from 5.5 percent in 2015 to 7.1 percent in 2016. Safe to say, backup technologies are hip and they’re going to stay hip at least till 2022; and probably afterwards too.

The giants backing the backup and recovery market

The impeccable growth rate of the backup and recovery market is no surprise. Over the last decade, giants have aggressively partaken in this industry and set the standards for innovation and service provision.

The names of tech giants empowering the backup market include, but are not limited to:

Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Microsoft Corporation

Oracle Corporation

IBM Corporation

EMC Corporation

Google Inc.

VMware Inc.

Dropbox Inc.

StoneFly Inc.

Barracuda Networks, Inc.

Veeam Software

Druva Software

Code42 Software Inc.

It’s pretty clear at this point that backup technology is facilitated by tech giants and relied upon by businesses around the globe.

The question remains: what’s the big deal about it anyways?

Differentiating data redundancy and data backups

Before indulging into the types of backup technologies, a concept deserves an honorable mention: data redundancy. Data redundancy is often confused with backup services, so it’s important to draw a line between it and data backups.

Data redundancy is simply the creation of replicas of data. In other words, you’re creating the same file in multiple locations. An example of this would be creating a file on your local system and then copying it on a USB flash drive; each time you update it. This is not the same as backup.

Backups are compressed version of the original data that you create. Usually, third party software creates these backups for you and the same software can use those files to restore them.

To clarify this, let’s say I gave you two files: one is the exact copy of your original file and the other is a backup file of that original data. You can use the copy as soon as it’s on your local system. For the backup file, you’ll need the software that created it and then you’ll have to restore from the backup file to access the original data within it.

Now that we’ve established the difference between redundancy and backups, let’s discuss some types of backup technologies.

Different kinds of backup technologies

Backup technologies can be divided into three main types:

On-premises backup appliances

Cloud backups

Hybrid backup solutions

I did not include tape storage solutions like USBs/flash drives, external hard drives, etc. in backup technologies because mostly they keep copies of the original data. And we have established before, that’s not backup; that’s data redundancy.

On-premises backup appliances — These are purpose built appliances that backup the data of specific departments or the entire business using a configured network and the right credentials. Mostly, these appliances sit idle and are used for the purpose of creating backups. They perform diligently when accessed to restore data.

However, how often do you lose data? Not so often right? That’s exactly the frequency of utilization for these appliances. That’s also the drawback; while they’re purpose is very important for businesses, especially for businesses with mission critical data, these appliances sit idle and are used infrequently. However, they do continue to consume resources like maintenance, power costs, cooling costs, etc.

The one big benefit of these appliances is that they’re faster than any other backup technology. If your IT infrastructure cannot tolerate delay when restoring data, then these appliances are the best option for you. They can facilitate heavy Input / Output (IOP) requirements while keeping the latency in check.

Cloud backups — With the accelerating cloud adoption, backups in the cloud are not a new concept. It’s the same as backing up in a backup appliance, the difference is you’re doing it over the internet and you’re backing up into someone else’s datacenter. The biggest advantage of cloud backups is the cost efficiency and the scalability of it.

There are a number of complications involved with scaling up a physical backup appliance. Cloud technology removes all those complications and makes the whole process simple. In terms of cost, you don’t have to invest as much as you would have to for the appliance.

Cloud based services also facilitate pay-as-you-go payment models. You don’t have to initially acquire storage resources in advance, you can scale-out as you go and you can pay for them as you scale-out.

Hybrid backup solutions — These are an interesting mix of solutions that can address a diverse range of data requirements. Hybrid backup solutions combine both on-premises and cloud based backup technologies.

IT infrastructures can setup physical appliances on-premises with cloud connect services or cloud gateway appliances and extend the backups to the cloud. Using this combination, they can keep the frequently used or mission critical backup data on-premises for reduced latency while using the cloud for infrequently used data backups. This combination adds the less latent on-premises technology with the scalable and cost effectively cloud technology.

We have differentiated between redundancy and backups and we’ve briefly discussed the three types of backup technologies; but we haven’t established what exactly is the big deal about backup technology? I know, it took a while but now we’re here.

The big deal about backup technology

Data loss is to businesses as Galactus is to planets. It can incur financial consequences, disrupt business processes and the worst case scenario includes eating up the whole business. Allow me to explain that with an example.

Imagine a financial services provider that has to process transactions by the minute. Due to compliance reasons and for record maintenance, this service provider has to maintain all of this data on their servers. If this data is not backed up and a server or servers crash due to hardware failure or power loss, then all of this data can be lost. If it is lost, then the service provider is in major trouble.

They have to answer to regulatory authorities while dealing with a ton of angry customers. If there data is backed up, they can notify their customers and apologize, recover and then just continue their service provision.

This fear of losing data, having your business disrupted and adversely affected is the reason why businesses around the globe are adapting backup technology to prevent it.

That concludes my thoughts on the subject, what do you think about it? Are backup technologies really that big of a deal? Share your thoughts by commenting below.

We sleep with our phones under our pillows, check our email countless times a day, and keep tabs on our friends, families, celebrities, and social media “influencers.”

For many users, though, the experiences designed by social media companies do not bring a sense of connection or relationship, but rather one of FOMO and a diminishing sense of self.

Outside of the proliferation of fake news, the interference of foreign actors in politics, and the collection of our personal information for unseemly uses, perhaps one of the worst results of the social-first world we’ve built is that social media usage has been shown to have a negative effect on mental health.

But, the tides are beginning to shift, as designers are coming out against the products they have created. Many companies (Imgur included) are taking a long, hard look in the mirror at the tools we’ve built and how they’ve been employed — for better, or worse — to determine what solutions are out there.

In order to better understand society’s relationship with the internet (and to see how well we, as a company, were delivering on our mission “to lift the world’s spirits”), my team and I partnered with the research specialists at Ypulse to survey 2,100 internet users about which platforms they use, and how they feel after using them.

What we found was confirmation that social media is a breeding ground for negativity. What follows is an in-depth look at the results of the study.

I first wanted us to gauge how users felt about social media in general. The results showed that 61 percent of respondents believe that spending too much time on social media is bad for their mental health, and what’s more, 57 percent said that the negative side of social media isn’t talked about enough.

What I learned is that while many people believe that social media has a largely negative impact, the majority believe that these issues aren’t being addressed. Additionally, two-thirds of social media users said that they wish social media was a more positive place.

What this told me is that there’s clearly an appetite for social media good, and it’s on us, as the individuals and companies behind the platforms, to deliver.

Credit: Ypulse, Feb-March 2018

The next aim was to determine if there was a correlation between the number and types of platforms that people use, and then to determine the varying impacts that they may have on the user.

What the study found was that the more social media platforms people use, the worse they feel. In fact, the data found that for every additional social media platform a person uses, their overall happiness level drops by 2 percent.

And that’s not all — the research also found that instead of creating a sense of community or camaraderie, social media actually has an isolating impact on its users.

For instance, the study found that Snapchat users reported the highest levels of FOMO after using the app, Instagram users reported the highest levels of depression, loneliness, and anxiety, and Twitter users felt the worst about bullying.

Credit: Ypulse, Feb-March 2018

My team and I decided to dig deeper into the core functionality of what these platforms do in order to understand why they might be having this impact. What we discovered was that these three platforms share one key commonality: They are all about replicating real-life social interactions, but seem to do so in an unsatisfying way that leaves the user feeling less connected than before.

So what’s the solution?

Although this data is discouraging, I believe it’s not all doom and gloom online. In fact, there are some platforms that were shown to make their users feel better. Platforms like YouTube and Netflix, which focus on entertainment and content and largely eschew social interaction or personal identity, were the ones impacting their users in a positive way.

Credit: Ypulse, Feb-March 2018

My belief based on these findings is that platforms which focus on entertainment and anonymity, rather than one’s personal identity online, seem to put people at ease and result in more positive emotions as a result.

My hypothesis based on the research is that the more that one’s “profile” becomes central to their online activity, the more vulnerable they’re left to experiencing negative effects. In turn, the less one’s personal sense of self is tied up in their online behavior, the less stressed they are.

Credit: Ypulse, Feb-March 2018

I believe that one (albeit surprising) solution for negativity online is anonymity. While there has been much criticism directed towards anonymous platforms (and some for good reason), not enough time has been spent exploring how socializing and sharing content anonymously can lead to a more positive and authentic user experience.

In fact, the data shows that anonymity can be positive. For one thing, anonymity often leads to more authentic and diverse content. It also enables people to share the “real them” as opposed to a curated, filtered digital version of themselves.

On many social platforms, the cherry-picked presentation of each user’s life leads to the distorted belief that everyone is happier and more successful than you are.

With this in mind, it’s no surprise that the top platforms where users said they can feel most like themselves were largely anonymous platforms like Reddit, Imgur, and Snapchat (I believe that Snapchat may fall into this category since followers and comments are private).

Credit: Ypulse, Feb-March 2018

There is plenty of evidence supporting the idea that positivity can be good for business, too. Data showed that when users feel happier using a platform, they are much more receptive to everything — including advertising.

The survey showed that being in a good mood makes social media users 83 percent more likely to enjoy seeing an ad. And the inverse is also true – when users are in a bad mood, seeing an ad online makes their bad mood even worse.

This is one key insight that I believe advertisers could tap into which would help improve their business tactics as well as the experience of the users interacting with their ads.

Credit: Ypulse, Feb-March 2018

The internet’s impact on our daily lives is an issue that isn’t going away anytime soon, and I believe that taking steps to understand and improve upon how it influences our wellbeing is critical. Users are actively calling for it, and it’s in society’s best interest that we make a shift. Data shows that egocentric platforms leave us vulnerable to judgement from all angles and, as a result, we can never rest easy.

But, when we as users don’t tie ourselves to our online identities and building up followers, and instead focus on anonymity and entertainment, we find ourselves happier as a result. It’s a net positive.

Background on the study: The research was conducted in February through March of 2018, and was a nationally representative sample of social media users between the ages of 13-35. Ypulse evaluated the top social and entertainment platforms and provided some fascinating insight into the issues surrounding mental health and social media.

But luckily that doesn’t apply to your in-house team — right? Wrong.

Remote working teams may be leading the way, but almost all teams need to learn to work together remotely. Even if you’re not hiring contractors in some far away country, your own team will benefit from the learnings we can take from remote teams.

Here’s why remote working styles are just as important for in-house teams.

In a sense, all teams are remote

Are you sitting next to all of your colleagues? Do you physically meet with your team several times a day? Yes, there are some situations where this does happen — my consulting days come to mind when an entire team would be sitting in a board room and working on top of each other all day and night! But for the most part, we’re largely separated from the people we work with.

Whether our colleagues are in another country or just down the hall, they’re not right with us so we need ways of working together online. The same systems and structures we need to work with an employee across the world will help up work with our team members sitting on another floor or in another office.

Embracing remote work keeps existing employees happy

If they haven’t already, it probably won’t be long before your team members start asking whether they can work from home. This is not something to dread or avoid! In fact, research shows that employees that work from home are happier and ‘massively more productive’ and companies that offer working from home options can reduce attrition by up to 50%.

If working from home seems scary, don’t worry — you don’t necessarily need to dive into a full-time working-from-home arrangement. A policy where employees can work from home one or two days a week often gives your team the flexibility they’re craving and keeps your company competitive.

Remote working styles help you focus on real productivity

Leaders are often reluctant to encourage working-from-home as they worry they won’t know whether the team is working productively. However, this is backwards thinking.

If you can’t tell whether people working remotely are being productive, it really indicates that you can’t track productivity, period. Even though seeing someone physically sitting at their desk might provide us with some comfort, it is no way to measure productivity!

Of course, productivity is often not easy to measure, and it varies greatly depending on the type of work your team performs. But it’s alway worthwhile to put systems in place that get your team focused on their productivity.

Thinking of your team as a remote team is a great way to instigate a new approach like this. Productivity tracking also doesn’t need to be as complex as you might think. For instance, it could include simple team disciplines like:

Holding a 10 minute start-of-day call to share each person’s plan for the day

A structure where everyone sends an end-of-day email to share what they’ve accomplished

A weekly share-your-work demonstration where the team takes turns to showcase something they’re working on and seek feedback from the team

Putting these types of structures in place is gets your team ready to work remotely but more importantly, improves team performance.

A remote working capability allows you to build a better team

Once you’ve got your existing team working well using remote team systems, you can use your these capabilities to attract new team members. This can be simply promoting the flexibility you now offer with working-from-home arrangements. Or, you could even go as far as to make the role available to candidates located in other areas entirely.

After all, why should you restrict your search to only those candidates that are available now within a 30 mile radius?

By broadening the talent pool, you can often attract someone of a much higher calibre. For businesses located in small towns or in areas that have a lot of competition for top talent, offering a remote position can give you a huge advantage.

Start building your remote working capability

Working with a distributed team has its challenges, but these also force disciplines that are beneficial to all teams. Creating a framework for teamwork online, before you actually need go remote, is a wise step for all teams to take.

Plus, learning to manage a team online is a skill all managers need to learn and embrace – whether that’s to increase the performance of your existing team or to prepare for pending remote work.

For those keeping score, the United States is hanging onto a slim lead, China is gaining fast ground, and most of Europe is close behind.

Among industries, financial services continues to hold a commanding advantage over telecom in terms of sophistication, breadth, and usefulness due to the transactional nature of the majority of banking transactions. Enterprise, banks, and financial institutions use Chatbots to reduce cost, improve speed, and improve success rate. Chatbots also gives enterprises a change to gather valuable information and experiment with new changes.

What these companies don’t yet realize is each Chatbot conversation should be considered a “transaction” or “business deal” even if no sale comes out of it for a variety of reasons, including: 1. The company obtains data they can use; 2. A great/bad experience can influence future sale and the customer’s opinion; and 3. Customers view chatbots as an extension of your company.

Slow data processing and management can ruin someone’s experience with chatbots within seconds. Companies who are able to store, process, and analyze data quickly and efficient will usher in a new generation of chatbots that can respond seamlessly and intelligently, providing recommendations rather than just reacting.

The best news, particularly from my perspective of being deeply involved in big data, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and analytics, is that advancements in chatbot technology continue to be arriving at a breakneck pace. This is making the accuracy and speed of chatbot technology greater all the time.

Chatbots: a technologist’s – and customer’s – dream

For those of us into such things, it’s a thrilling technology, combining the continually advancing fields of AI, ML, natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics, big data, analytics, and bot logic and botflow making.

Obtaining data and training your chatbot to correctly process a conversation/situation is essential to be successful. Companies who are releasing chatbots early will give their product an advantage due to the amount of data they’re getting, which means enterprises should start adopting chatbots now while consumers don’t have very high expectations.

When done right, chatbots eliminate repetitive tasks – making workloads lighter, easier, and faster – while promoting greater customer satisfaction for the organizations that deploy them.

No real progress in chatbot technology can be made. However advancements in NLP, and chatbot technology advancements based on NLP, simply can’t happen without the ability to save, store, access, integrate with other customer data and analyze massive amounts of data in a cost-effective way. It is here where the technological foundation of all highly functional chatbots resides. You need a highly developed data management platform to run very complex analytics at scale and churn through a range of NLP models quickly and efficiently.

After all, it’s not very useful if it takes 12 hours to process the amount of data it takes to come up with a functional chatbot interaction. But if you can churn through that same amount of data in five minutes, then you’re more likely than not to develop a successful chatbot interaction.

Chatbots in finance

Built on processing massive amount of information, finance is an ideal industry for automation and reduction of salary expenditure, two issues chatbots addresses. However, a new study from PwC showed that two-thirds of U.S. financial services respondents surveyed said they’re limited by operations, regulations, budgets, or resources to make the investment in such innovative development.

Fintech companies such as Plum, Digit and Cleo use chatbots to drive microsaving by putting small amounts of money into saving accounts each day for their users. These companies’ chatbot is their core product, unlike legacy banks that use this function to supplement a core product.

More finance applications beyond just providing automated savings are being worked on every day, including using chatbots to detect and notify of fraudulent behavior, become a wealth management advisor, underwrite loans and insurance, and provide data analysis and advanced analytics.

Chatbots in banking

Chatbots in banking is relatively inexpensive to develop and maintain since they require less coding than standalone banking apps. Banks save the cost of developing their own channels thanks to the current growth in the popularity of messaging platforms, as well as save on data storage thanks to cloud-based systems.

Companies such as Cleo, Stripe, and Wealthfront are disrupting the market, but it’s more difficult for them to meet the demand of key bank products (such as loans) due to less restricted regulations that force their customers to spend heavily on compliance and maintain large capital cushions.

DBS Bank uses Kasisto’s KAI to allow customers to conduct transactions such as transfers and bill paying. In addition, customers can ask about their personal finances using messaging applications and through the banks platform. DBS’ digibank, India’s first digital-only bank, uses KAI to process 82 percent of customer requests, meaning digibank handles less than a fifth of all customer interactions.

Striving for the elusive 10 on a 1-to-10 scale

On a scale of 1-to-10, with 10 being a perfect state, chatbots are functioning at a 6.5 (a year ago, I’d say we were below 6.0). They’re actually very useful for a specific set of tasks such as asking for the balance in your bank account – but they’re still not very good in unstructured situations that are out of the realm of what they’ve been programmed to do.

As for the future, I think we can get to 9.0 in the next 18 to 36 months. We’re going to see very quick improvements in NLP in that short of a timespan. But then we’re going to hit a bump, because that last 10 percent will involve solving extremely challenging NLP issues such as nuances in language and style, and providing meaningful contexts in unstructured interactions.

This is all from the perspective of the English language, of course. Chatbot technology is predominantly English-centric because the amount of research and tradition in the field has been conducted in the United States. Plus, looking at the applications for NLP, English has been the de facto language – and more specifically, the global financial services industry is generally conducted in English.

So, if you’re developing a broad chatbot application, English is the obvious starting point. But we’re seeing China coming up to speed in terms of sophistication very, very quickly. They’ve made chatbot technology a national priority. The government is sponsoring it, funding it and has even exhibited control over it following an unexpected embarrassment last summer.

No secret: Chatbots will only get better and more prevalent

Ironically, even though financial services had some of the earliest successful chatbot adopters, the industry as a whole didn’t throw its support behind the technology. That’s because the more successful a project is, the less likely you are to hear about it. For obvious reasons, banks don’t want to tell other banks how to compete against them.

But, as they say, that train has already left the station. Financial services businesses understand that chatbot initiatives are important – and this is increasingly true in other sectors. They also know that achieving scale without increasing overhead is a key business component.

If they aren’t getting involved in this, they’re probably going to be at a disadvantage. Without chatbots, they won’t be able to compete. And without continual research and development into optimizing NLP, AI/ML and other emerging technologies, they won’t have the type of chatbots that will help them compete.

It’s the reigning mantra in high tech, swiping “move fast and break things” and “data is the new oil” right off the menu of things to say when you aren’t paying attention.

Attend any conference and you will hear people talk about how new strategic initiatives are stuck because employees don’t want to learn new skills, or because they feel that new processes or technology are being implemented as a way to take their job.

But let’s think differently for a moment. What if it isn’t people, or process?

What if it’s the technology? What if the delays and implemental failures are because the technology isn’t really that good? That it’s difficult to use or only delivers benefits in “soft costs” while the vendor wants hard cash. When was the last time you heard someone praise an ERP upgrade? At best, they will tell you it wasn’t as bad as kidney failure.

Culture, leadership, and human factors do play an outsized role in success, but even in organizations tuned like a Ferrari, inept technology can slow you down. Think of it: some of your highest-paid and highest-skilled employees are doing the equivalent of digital file clerking because the magical algorithm needs help. Tesla’s Elon Musk, for instance, recently admitted that one of the likely culprits in the Model 3 delays have been too many robots on the factory line. More humans might be a better idea, he added.

Some engineers will respond by noting that the technology works and the “people” neglected to use it properly. I’ll give them that. We’re careless, harried knuckleheads. But that’s a given. Like a network TV exec, you’ve got to live with the fact that only 18% of us has an attention span longer than 22 minutes.

My brother clued me into the power of bad technology years ago. He’s an urologist, an advocate for robotic surgery and a frequent critic of online medical records. “Don’t you get it Angelo? By going online we can cut administrative costs and improve quality of care throughout a patient’s lifetime,” I’d bellow.

True, but he also counters that these applications often force doctors to shift from notes to check-box like diagnoses, eroding the quality of care. The data management systems can be fussy and force him to expend more hours in administration, driving up the cost. Worst of all, you’re no longer looking at the patient. You’re focused on a black box: bad for the doctor and the patient.

The “right idea, wrong tool” phenomenon plays out all over the place. In Guns, Germs and Steel, Jared Diamond noted that New Guinea villagers immediately adopted the sweet potato as a food source when they first encountered it, and planted it in vertical hillside rows. Missionaries and aid workers corrected them and told them to plant in horizontal rows. In the first major rainstorms, crops were washed out. Vertical planting returned.

So how will this play out in IoT? On one hand, you’re going to see some tremendous success stories where designers spent the extra cycles to figure out how to bring technology into the workplace without screwing up the day of employees. You’ll see situations where factory productivity will go up at the same time as safety. Water utilities are already discovering that smart meters and data analytics for finding leaks has become the cheapest and quickest way to beat droughts and meet growing demand for water.

On the other hand, you’ll see smart windows turning noon into night and people spending hours on the phone trying to reverse changes made by intelligent supply chain systems. Unforeseen problems will abound.

And we just can’t respond with, “It’s the people.”

It’s just a matter of time. The technology has been actively researched since 1969, before consumer computers even existed, when a researcher showed that monkeys could amplify their brain signals to control a needle on a dial.

Today, researchers are making strides to bring brain-machine interfaces closer to reality. Stanford researchers successfully created an interface for brain-controlled typing where users simply imagine their own hand movements to move an on-screen cursor, helping paralyzed users communicate.

Startup CTRL-Labs has figured out a way to make the brain-machine interface possible without the need for an intrusive implant thanks to an electromyography (EMG) wristband and machine learning.

For mobile, a brain-machine interface could be a pivotal moment in computing. The keyboard has been around since the genesis of the computer, and its replacement will come in the form of a brain-to-machine technology.

Touch screens were seen as a major step forward, allowing users to interact directly with elements on the screen instead of using a mouse, but brain-machine interfaces are entirely different and have the ability to fundamentally change how we interact with our devices. And just as with new technologies like virtual reality, augmented reality, and motion tracking, gaming will be the industry that pushes brain-machine interfaces into the mainstream.

Mind games

Beyond the obvious use of brain-machine interfaces assisting the disabled, the technology could also change how we use devices in the future, and one of the most local implementations is in gaming. Like the Nintendo Gameboy that ushered in the era of handheld devices (superseding the Palm Pilot), and powerful graphics cards once used for gaming now turned into tools for design and Bitcoin mining, gaming will push forward an era of brain-controlled input devices in the near future.

Brain-machine interfaces offer a solution to the current problems with mobile gaming, namely that our hands and fingers block most of the action happening on screen. Additionally, touch screen controls just aren’t good at providing us with feedback. Physical controls give us palpable signals to know when we’re pressing harder or if we’re providing the intended input.

This just can’t be replicated with smartphones, even with new technologies like Apple’s 3D Touch and Taptic Engine. While Fortnite may be huge on mobile, there are still plenty of gamers who prefer the feedback and input methods of console and PC.

Shifting perspectives to VR, we’re still constrained by clunky controllers instead of using our hands naturally. Today’s VR controllers are a necessary evil until more natural ways of communicating with machines are achieved, like with CTRL-Labs’ brain-machine interface or Leap Motion’s hand tracking tech.

Hand tracking is nice, but it still creates an extra layer of interpretation (a camera must recognize and interpret our gestures) rather than giving our brains a direct input path.

By getting rid of controllers, gaming could feel a lot more natural and approachable, and as a result, BMI technology will be more widely accepted and adopted. “We’re working toward the ability for users to be able to walk up, put the band on, not have to do any training, and be able to roll right way,” said Mike Astolfi, head of interactive experiences at CTRL-Labs, speaking with Engadget.

We’re already seeing companies experiment with brain-to-brain interfaces, which allows participants to collaborate on a game of 20 questions. Another startup called Neurable is working on a VR game that lets players interact with virtual objects telepathically via its accessory for the HTC Vive. “We wanted to create a system that would require basically no training,” said Neurable CEO Rames Alcaide speaking with IEEE Spectrum.

Once brain-machine interfaces take off, VR experiences will be much more immersive, as players can simply interact with virtual environments like they would in real life without the need for a controller acting as a middleman. Additionally, gaming experiences, whether in VR, AR, or other means, can finally be provided with real-time feedback to adapt experiences to us.

For example, imagine a horror game that detects when we get increasingly nervous and ramps up the horror factor. On the flipside, you could have games and apps that help users relax via measurable feedback via heart rate and muscle tension.

By lowering the learning curve for various technology platforms, brain-machine interfaces could bring VR into the mainstream as touch controls did for the smartphone. Simultaneously, BMI input devices will be brought into the mainstream by VR.

Challenges moving forward

While brain-machine interfaces are an inevitability, they face a number of issues that must be solved before it can brought to market as a computing input method, let alone as a gaming peripheral.

The biggest problems brain-machine interfaces must solve for gaming are accuracy and latency. Gaming requires high accuracy and low latency in order for players to feel in control and be competitive. Any hint of lag will frustrate players.

his is why professional esports athletes still prefer wired peripherals even though wireless keyboards, mice, and controllers have become the norm for a majority of consumers.

Of course, with sufficient advancement, brain-machine interfaces could theoretically offer the least amount of latency out of controlling options; brain-to-software with no physical interface between is the shortest possible path.

Furthermore, brain-machine interfaces are only one part of the equation for changing the gaming paradigm. Games will likely rely on multiple input devices and data sources like heart rate monitors and eye tracking to make truly immersive experiences a possibility.

Trying to miniaturize all of this tech into an unobtrusive headset or other peripheral will be a massive challenge for the near future. But whatever the growing pains are, the struggle will be worth it for the new experiences and accessibility brain-machine interfaces bring.

You might have anti-virus software on your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop. You might avoid using them to visit suspicious websites and carefully protect your various login details.

But it’s no longer just what we typically think of as computers that are connected to the internet and so at risk of cyber attacks. And if multiple devices are connected to the same network in your home or office, then if a hacker breaks into one machine they could gain access to all of them.

Security researchers recently claimed to have hacked into a computer network by sending a malicious fax. And there are many other seemingly unlikely ways a hacker can get access to your system. You might have a well-protected front door to the internet, but could someone get in by means of the recently installed cat flap in the conservatory?

Printers and baby monitors

Some devices we recognize as being related to our computers, but we don’t necessarily think of them as being connected to the internet. Nowadays, printers often have their own internet connection to allow them to talk to other devices in your home or office, often wirelessly.

This connection provides the first step for hackers to remotely access your network. Then they just need to get around any security controls and they can hack into not just the printer but the other devices connected to it. Printer vulnerabilities have been well documented, with one hacker claiming to have broken into 150,000 printers in order to raise awareness of their insecurity.

Similarly, many baby monitors and security cameras now connect to the internet to allow people to access them from outside the home. New York’s Department of Consumer Affairs issued a public warning about baby monitor security following a number of widely reported incidents of strangers’ voices being heard over them.

Toys and coffee makers

The creation of the so-called Internet of Things means it’s not just computer accessories that are now connected but also devices, appliances and objects that we traditionally don’t see as having anything to do with this kind of technology. And it seems that almost as soon as any device is connected to the internet, it gets hacked. Recent examples include cars, toys, thermostats, medical implants and even coffee machines.

A hacker who succeeds in communicating with one of these device can then conduct any number of possible attacks. They could disrupt communications, which would be irritating in the case of a coffee machine, but potentially life threatening in the case of a medical implant.

They could also access data sent to the device, again probably uninteresting in the case of a toy, but potentially a security risk if someone can find out where your car is likely to be left unattended or when your home is empty (and your heating is off).

Fax machines

Intriguingly, even some devices that are not directly plugged into the internet can be hacked. As mentioned, it was recently reported that fax machines could be hacked by sending carefully crafted image files to them containing malicious code.

When this image was converted into data for transmission within the internal computer network, the code hidden within this data was able to run and inflict its damage.

This method of intrusion, which any device with an external connection to the outside world is potentially vulnerable to, enables hackers to insert malicious software such as a virus into the computer networks connected to the device.

This code might not just be used to attack the infiltrated network, but could also connect the devices on it to a wider distributed network of hijacked machines. The hackers could then use this collective computing power to steal passwords, search for bankcard details, bombard websites with requests for data in order to disrupt their service, or attack yet more computers.

Staying safe

Of course, just because something can be hacked does not mean that it will be. An expert user can use network security technologies such as firewalls and strong authentication methods to reduce the risks of outsiders attacking internet-connected devices.

But most users are not experts and every device we connect creates a new opportunity for anyone trying to break into our computer systems.

As a society, we have to ask ourselves two big questions. First, what technology will it really benefit us to connect to the internet? A heart monitor that can be tracked by your doctor? Probably. A doll that can have sophisticated conversations but also records everything your child says? Less so.

Second, for those technologies we do want connected, how do we get device manufacturers to take their cyber security seriously? Most new internet-connected products lack the security of more traditional computers such as laptops and phones.

The answer probably relies on market pressure, which always takes time to exert its influence. We can do our own part by asking questions about security before purchasing new devices but, ultimately, it’s suppliers who have to make their devices secure.

That said, just because your kettle can connect to the internet, does not mean that you have to let it do so. I fear, however, that we are going to be reading about insecure fridges and hackable toasters for a considerable time to come.

One of the reasons behind this growth is both the increased population and the higher rate of internet penetration across the continent, with an average of 59 percent of the population using the internet.

Argentina is at the top of the leaderboard in this area, with 71 percent of Argentines connecting to the world wide web on a regular basis, followed by Chile, Uruguay and Costa Rica tying for second place with 66 percent, and Ecuador lagging behind with 54 percent.

Mexico boasts a place as the largest ecommerce market in Latin America, with a US$21 billion annual spend, making up a hefty chunk of the US$71.2 billion annual total for the region. Brazil isn’t too far behind with US$18.86, but Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Peru are the stragglers with US$6.83, US$4.93, US$3.7 and US$3 billion respectively.

When looking at where the burgeoning online consumers cohort spend their money, a common theme develops across the continent. MercadoLibre (MercadoLivre in Brazil) is without doubt the dominating platform for online commerce.

The ecommerce giant had 56.3 million unique visitors in May alone, with global powerhouse Amazon trailing behind at 22.4 million. MercadoLibre’s stronghold on Latin America has made it extremely difficult for Amazon to get a grip on the online market.

“Many investors see MercadoLibre as a sort of Latin American Amazon.com,” explained writer Jeremy Bowman in investment magazine The Motley Fool. “The company has growth opportunities in its payment platform Mercado Pago and its ecommerce marketplace in the huge Latin American Market.”

Only Chile bucks the trend, with yapo.cl taking the lead above MercadoLibre as the country’s most used ecommerce platform. For the remaining countries however, MercadoLibre invariably takes the top spot followed by either Amazon or Olx.

Mexico already has the highest annual earnings from ecommerce in the region, and this is expected to grow in response to improvements in connectivity, better financial inclusions and increased digital literacy.

Ecommerce is encouraged through retail events that offer special promotions, such as Hot Sale Event, which is similar to Black Friday in the US and offers reduced prices on clothing and electronics, the two top-selling online products in the country.

MercadoLibre and Amazon are the top online sellers, and the majority of Mexican e-shoppers make international purchases and perhaps as a response to this, 70 percent of online shoppers prefer to pay for their products via Paypal.

As Latin American countries continue to develop their technology at a phenomenal rate, ecommerce is only set to grow as the population takes advantage of the increased convenience and lower prices. As Amazon shoulders its way onto the continent however, it remains to be seen whether MercadoLibre will hold out against the global powerhouse.

As an example, for the first time, you can use other apps besides Apple Maps as your preferred navigation software for Apple’s in-car platform. With that change now possible, Google Maps and Waze are both planning to support CarPlay and have begun beta testing.

Unfortunately it’s not a beta test most of us can join, so you’ll have to wait for the proper release before you can use either of these in your own vehicle through CarPlay. But some early screenshots posted by 9to5Mac provide a good preview of how Google Maps and Waze will look once that happens.

Both apps are already available on Android Auto, so the developers behind each app are well familiar with the basics of optimizing their navigation for an in-car display: make the icons big, text readable, and directions... well, accurate. Apple Maps continues to get better and better, but G Maps and Waze each have their own strengths.

Google Maps utilizes Google’s own traffic and mapping data, which you might trust a bit more than Apple’s — even now. It also syncs up with your saved places. And Waze is pretty unrivaled when it comes to warning you about accidents or, for those who go heavy on the gas pedal, nearby police. Google Maps still looks like a Google app while following CarPlay’s UI guidelines.

There’s no official word on exactly when the CarPlay versions of Google Maps and Waze will widely roll out to users. But with iOS 12 widely launching on Monday — you can already install it now, remember — hopefully it won’t be long before this beta graduates to a full update.","capabilities

In August, the Trump administration levied a 25 percent tariff against $16 billion in Chinese goods. The tariffs went into effect on August 23rd, and included some electronics, chemicals, and batteries. The administration proposed another round of tariffs in June and July against $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, which would include consumer electronics from companies like Apple, Fitbit, and Sonos.

After this latest round was proposed, Apple issued a letter to the US’s Trade Representative earlier this month, asking that the proposal be revised, prompting a response from President Trump, who suggested that Apple move its manufacturing plants to the US.","the wall street journal

The award was the first for a Chinese author, and put Liu in the global spotlight. Sequels to that novel, The Dark Forest and Death’s End, also received widespread acclaim, and now, Liu has a new book out in English: Ball Lightning, translated by Joel Martinsen. Like The Three-Body Problem, it’s a gripping tale of technology and physics, one that explores the nature of obsession and the dark places it can lead.

Spoilers for the novel ahead.

As a story, Ball Lightning is a bit more of a grounded read than The Three-Body Problem. There are no aliens in this story, which follows the life of a young man named Chen who watches as both of his parents are incinerated by a phenomenon known as ball lightning. Their deaths frames the direction of the rest of his life. Haunted by the memory of his dead parents, he obsesses over the strange incident, going to university to learn everything he can about ball lightning.

He lives out an isolated existence, putting everything aside in pursuit of his obsession, and eventually meets Lin Yun, an Army officer who works in an experimental weapons division, who also has a fascination with the phenomenon: she wants to learn everything about the incredible energy not in the pursuit of knowledge, but to utilize it as a weapon.

With their mutual interests, the pair fall into familiar company: Liu takes them to the remains of a Soviet weapons factory, where they meet a disillusioned weapons scientist who lost everything in his pursuit of knowledge. Chen has a realization that perhaps he’s thrown his life away in a fruitless pursuit, but after a revelation, throws himself back into study. He and his fellow scientists realize that they have stumbled upon a new, fundamental nature of reality: ball lightning doesn’t appear randomly, but is composed of macro-elements: massive, unseen electrons that appears when the conditions line up perfectly.

As in The Three-Body Problem, Liu’s journey is laid out in a mostly chronological, straight-forward way. Readers discover revelations alongside the characters, with plenty of detours for scientific explanation, or backtracking to cover the specific history for a character. Ball Lightning does’t quite reach the lofty heights that The Three-Body Problem. Joel Martinsen’s translation is flatter and more passive, and the main character never quite comes to terms with the death of his parents in a way that leaves the story feeling slightly incomplete.

Ball Lightning showcases the inherent dangers in developing advanced weapons with experimental science and technology.

Instead, Liu focuses less on exploring his characters’ personal issues and more on their obsession with ball lightning. Chen and Lin are brought together by nearly identical circumstances: Chen is drawn into his studies to try and uncover why his parents died in such a horrific manner, while the death of Lin’s mother leads her down the path to weapons research, as she tries to develop a breakthrough technology that could save other lives down the road. In both, we see the destructive qualities that their obsessions generate. Lin is reckless, selling prototype weapons to other countries and disregarding the safety of the people under her command. Chen’s fixation is a little less dangerous, but it leaves him an isolated, with little support to help him cope with his work and trauma.

More broadly, Ball Lightning showcases the inherent dangers in developing advanced weapons with experimental science and technology. The ball lightning weapons that Lin and Chen are responsible for creating could aid China against its adversaries (presumably the United States, but frustratingly, Liu never fleshes out the specific geopolitics of the looming war). But they could — and do — come at a high cost to the country. There are parallels to the pursuit of the atomic bomb during the Second World War: the weapons helped bring an end to the conflict, but introduced new and terrifying dangers to the world with their invention.

Ultimately, Ball Lighting has all of the elements that brought Liu bursting onto the world stage with his Three-Body novels: a story of fantastical science and technology, and the dangers they pose in the wrong hands.","straightforward

The Apple Watch Series 4 — with its rounded corners, larger display, and built-in EKG scanner — became undoubtedly the most sought-after gadget in the aftermath of Apple’s fall hardware refresh. While many people have bemoaned having to choose between the iPhone XS and XR, or are simply forgoing a mobile upgrade entirely, the Series 4 stood out for how simple of a purchase it is for those who’ve been sitting on the sidelines of the wearable market.

For those like me who’ve had an older Apple Watch Series 0 or 1, it’s a no-brainer, and it was what I was most excited about when I decided to stay up on Thursday night to claim a midnight order. The disparity is best illustrated by the fact that, after less than half a day of orders, every single tier of iPhone XS available right now has a September 28th to October 5th shipping window. Nearly every model of the Apple Watch Series 4, on the other hand, won’t ship until October 12th to October 19th.

The iPhone has become boring

There’s a number of reasons why the Apple Watch is outshining the iPhone these days. The first and most obvious is that the iPhone has become boring, trapped by the diminishing returns Apple can wring out of the device year after year. It would seem, 11 years after the introduction of the first iPhone, that Apple’s marquee product has simply lost a majority of its luster. There are only so many upgrades and standout features you can add to a mobile product before its incremental changes are overshadowed by how much it costs.

Simply take a look back at the last four years of iPhones. In 2014, Apple introduced the Plus version of the iPhone when it released the iPhone 6, which helped cement the trend of ever-larger displays that Samsung and other Asian manufacturers had first promoted. In 2015, the phone was paired with the Apple Watch for the first time, giving diehard fans a better reason to incorporate more Apple hardware and software into their lives. The year after, the company removed the headphone jack and released the AirPods, kicking off a debate about how and when to force consumers and the industry toward a wireless vision for the future. Last year, we got the iPhone X. With its signature notch, bezel-less display, and FaceID, it became an industry trendsetter and facilitated a more interesting debate about smartphone design than we’ve enjoyed in years.

This year, which is admittedly an S upgrade year and so understandably less exciting, it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of room for the iPhone to grow. That leads to the second most obvious reason why it’s become harder to care about the iPhone: price. As the iPhone has stagnated in terms of new features, Apple has increased the average cost of its flagship device by more than $300, from around $775 to $1,100.

The company figured out last year with the iPhone X that customers would be willing to pay not for meaningful new features, but for design and aesthetic improvements. So it began using higher-quality materials, like OLED displays and glass back plates, and increasing the available storage tiers. This year, you can get an iPhone XS Max with 512GB of storage for $1,449, making it the most expensive iPhone ever made, just like the X was before it.

My latest, as the kids say: man, buying the best iPhone costs a LOT more than it did just two years ago. https://t.co/NWYJsgr57v — Nathan Ingraham (@NateIngraham) September 13, 2018

Granted, there are a number of customers who are likely waiting for the iPhone XR, which will be arguably the highest quality and most feature-packed $749 smartphone the company has ever sold. (Preorders for the XR don’t open up until next month, as Apple is working out supply chain and manufacturing kinks.) There is an argument to make that the XR is the more interesting, mass market-friendly, and potentially successful phone of the three, but we won’t know that until later this year.

As it stands today, Apple’s flagship phone is the least exciting device it’s put out in a long time, and it’s easy to see why it’s being outshined by the Apple Watch. What started as an underdog product arriving late to the wearable scene, the Apple Watch has since become not only the world’s best-selling wearable, but the world’s best-selling watch, period.

Each new Apple Watch adds something exciting and impressive

Apple has achieved that by consistently improving its hardware and software with each new annual iteration. Just like the early days of the iPhone, each new Apple Watch adds something exciting and legitimately impressive, from the water-resistance of the Series 2 to the cellular connectivity of the Series 3. Now, with the Series 4, Apple has added a built-in EKG scanner and the first hardware design overhaul the watch has had since its inception.

There will be a time when the Apple Watch, like the iPhone, becomes a stagnant product that simply becomes more exorbitant and expensive. Ironically, Apple’s very first Apple Watch contained a line of now-discontinued models as expensive as $17,000. So there’s quite a lot of room for the company to grow its smartwatch brand and expand it back into the luxury market. But until then, we can expect quite a few more years of novel innovations and design overhauls.

Perhaps Apple overcomes engineering and design hurdles to create a round-shaped Apple Watch. Maybe the company figures out how to extend the battery life by more than 24 hours. There’s myriad ways the Apple Watch can improve and reach a more mass-market audience. But one thing is for sure right now: with the Series 4 out in the wild, it’s probably a more invigorating time to be developing the next Apple Watch than the next iPhone, and customers seem to be responding visibly to that shift.","nathan ingraham nateingraham

But mostly, it means I’m back to being continually puzzled about how this show works. I enjoy watching it in a lot of ways, but a season and one episode in, I still have no sense of where it’s going, what it’s building toward, or even the stories that matter most to it.

What’s really fascinating about the season two premiere is how little has changed. The episode jumps ahead five years, but it may as well be a full-on recap of season one. Everyone is doing the exact same things as they used to, in the exact emotional or romantic state they left off in, just with a slightly better job than they had before.

On one hand, it’s a really interesting way to bring people back into the show — I didn’t remember where things left off all that well, but now I’m entirely back up to speed. But on the other, it gives me even less hope that the show will bring its characters barreling toward any kind of meaningful conflict. There are a ton of interesting characters in play, and I’m still waiting to see where they’re going.

Check out nine trailers from this week below.

Chilling Adventures of Sabrina

The team behind Riverdale is rebooting Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and wow is it immensely darker than the series you remember. The new show stars Kiernan Shipka, who played Sally Draper in Mad Men, and yeah it’s just jumping straight into satanic imagery and immense creepiness... but also stylishness? The first season comes out October 26th.

She-Ra and the Princesses of Power

Netflix and DreamWorks are bringing back She-Ra, and they gave a first brief glimpse at the series this week. The artwork looks absolutely gorgeous, and the show’s description makes a point of calling out its interest in showing both strong and flawed female characters “in a world where women are unabashedly at the forefront.” It debuts November 16th.

The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The Coen brothers’ latest project is headed to Netflix. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs was originally conceived as a six-episode anthology TV series, but somewhere in the last year it seems that it was whittled down to a single film that just happens to tell six different stories. Either way, it seems like there’ll be plenty to like for fans of the Coen brothers’ sense of humor. It comes out November 16th.

Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors

Marvel has a new animated film coming up that features a bunch of its teenage heroes, with Ms. Marvel and Squirrel Girl at the center of it all. The film has a very ‘80s cartoon look to it, which makes me wonder how much it’ll appeal to younger audiences, but at least it’s another showcase of some fan favorite female heroes. The film will be on the Disney Channel and Disney XD starting September 30th.

Homecoming

Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail is behind this new thriller that has Julia Roberts playing a woman who seems to have had some strange experiences while working at an experimental government facility. The show is based off of a podcast of the same name, which Esmail apparently loved enough to think it was worth adapting — and directing all the episodes himself. It comes to Amazon on November 2nd.

Hilda

I don’t write about a lot of kids series here, but the artwork in this one is just too wonderful to ignore. It’s based off the Hilda series of graphic novels that Luke Pearson has been writing and illustrating over the past eight years, and it’s filled with what seems like a constant supply of incredible creatures and dreamy versions of familiar locales. It comes out September 21st on Netflix.

The Romanoffs

Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner is back with an anthology series for Amazon that has a ton of famous people (and some Mad Men veterans) playing a bunch of rich people who are supposedly all related. It’s hard to get a great sense of what the show will be like from this trailer, but it seems like the reason to watch it is because there are lots of famous people and places, and you liked Mad Men. Which, fair enough. It comes out October 12th.

The Beach Bum

The writer and director of Spring Breakers is back with a new movie that seems to be much in the same vein. The Beach Bum has Matthew McConaughey playing a perpetually high dude who hangs out with a colorful cast of characters in tropical locales while making a complete mess of things. Snoop Dog costars... as does Jimmy Buffett, somehow. It comes out March 22nd.

Captive State

Okay, here’s the thing: this trailer is awful. It’s just a ton of overused sci-fi cliches. But then, a minute and a half in, it gets amazing. For like two seconds. And then it ends. Just watch until the big reveal. I love it.","disney channel and disney

Next year remains a mystery. Apple has gone through all the numbers from one through ten, skipping two and nine for its own reasons. Now, for better or worse, next year, it’ll likely need to figure out a new naming scheme.

Apple hastened its way toward a dead end last year when it decided to switch to Roman numerals rather than continuing with numbers as it had done in the past. A report from Bloomberg at the end of August indicated that the people behind the names struggled to come up with names that would work. Since this year’s iPhones didn’t really change many things beyond last year’s, they didn’t seem compelling enough to grant a whole new name. The cheapest iPhone is also bigger than the midrange option, so Apple namers had to take that into consideration, too and aim for a name that wouldn’t confuse consumers.

The iPhone XS Max just sounds like a bad name

The final results still seem... kind of bad. For some reason, Apple went with an iPhone XS Max, instead of just going for an iPhone XS and an iPhone Max. The distinction is clear: Apple wanted to send a message that the two phones are related in some way. But to the average person, the iPhone XS Max just sounds like a pretty bad name. Why didn’t they go with iPhone XS and XL? That just makes logical sense, and since we’re used to seeing those letters represent sizes, it’s not as unfamiliar and difficult to say as XR and XS Max and XS. Try saying that five times fast.

This is the first year that Apple has added letters to a letter and wanted us to pronounce one of them as a number and the other as a letter. It’s very much like 1984 — the novel, not Apple’s infamous Super Bowl ad — where Big Brother tortures Winston Smith to believe that two plus two equals five and to clearly forget they equal four. Apple wants us to read X as “ten,” when the logical thing to do is to read it as the letter “X.” And so it’s the Ten R, the Ten S, and the Ten S Max, which sound a lot better than how you’d actually read them, as alphabet soup.

All the iPhone names and their launch years iPhone in 2007 iPhone 3G in 2008 iPhone 3GS in 2009 iPhone 4 in 2010 iPhone 4S in 2011 iPhone 5 in 2012 iPhone 5C, iPhone 5S in 2013 iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus in 2014 iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus in 2015 iPhone SE in early 2016 iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus in 2016 iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X in 2017 iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max in 2018

Setting aside this year’s naming horrors, Apple pretty much has a clean slate for next year. It could keep counting forever or drop numbers completely. Now that we’ve arrived at 10, where does Apple go from here? Here’s a list of possibilities and reasons behind them:

iPhone Eleven

This is clearly the logical and easy choice. And yet, if Apple goes down this path, that’s a lot of numbers. No phone company is sitting out there with a smartphone 34 or a 57. It just doesn’t feel sustainable in the long-run.

Apple Phone

Going back to a clean and simple name might actually bode well for Apple. Before the iMacs and the iPads, Apple’s naming convention was just to stick its name before everything. So while this name seems silly at first, it could very well be possible.

iPhone XX

Following the same pattern where Apple skipped 2 and 9 in its phone lineup and just headed toward the flashier numbers, what if Apple just skipped all the way to twenty?

iPhone XC

There has only been one ‘C’ branded iPhone before, and that’s the iPhone 5C in 2013, which had disappointing but not terrible sales during its run. People like cheap iPhones, and maybe Apple has really reached its max price point this time, so it’s time to walk it back with a truly budget version of the iPhone X next year. Still, it seems unlikely that Apple would have a third year of iPhone X-related names, though.

iPhone ii

Think about it. There never was an iPhone 2 and Apple started the lowercase i trend way before it was cool. What about... three lowercase i’s in a name? Insanity. The ii can be interpreted as an 11 or as a 2, in keeping with the pattern of making us read letters as numbers.

iPhone Y and iPhone Z

Why not, if we’re just finishing off the alphabet here? Pokémon taught us the last three letters of the alphabet are pretty cool together.

iPhone Panther

Apple could take a cue from its OS X naming schemes and start naming iPhones after large jungle cats, national parks, or deserts. The iPhone Panther has a great ring to it, but it’s just an example. If Apple goes down this route, it would have a vast database of names to pull from.

iPhone Pro and iPhone Air

Similarly, what if Apple takes a cue from how it names its Macbooks and just starts tacking on a word at the end? Simplistic, clean, and none of that XS Max nonsense.

No more names

Just list the year and the screen size, as Apple does with its latest iPads and Macbooks. The new iPhones will be called the 2019 6.8-inch iPhone and the 2019 6.5-inch iPhone, and we’ll go from there. It’s easy and saves energy spent naming and worrying about naming for other important tasks.","ipads apple’s naming

The hurricane — now downgraded to a tropical storm — is hovering over the area, unleashing torrential rainfall, and creeping towards the west at a glacial three miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. That means the rain will continue to pound the same waterlogged ground — which, combined with storm surge, is leading to deadly flooding. So far, at least two people have died, according to Vox.

“Look at how slow this system is,” NHC director Ken Graham said in a Facebook Live briefing Friday morning. (When Graham talks about the storm’s speed, he means the pace at which it’s traveling, not the wind speed.) “Before that’s all said and done, it’s going to leave a wake of water, and river flooding, and a whole lot of impacts.”

“Right out of the gate, that’s not good.”

We saw a similar leisurely pace with Hurricane Harvey, which dumped more than five feet of water on southeastern Texas, killing 68 people and causing so much damage that it was costlier than any hurricane except Katrina, the NHC says. So Florence’s slow speed means more danger for people in the storm’s path, as first reported by Kendra Pierre-Louis at The New York Times and Brian Resnick for Vox.

“Everything that comes with a hurricane sticks around longer,” says James Kossin, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That means salt water flooding from storm surge, freshwater water flooding from rain, wind damage. “Right out of the gate, that’s not good.” Kossin’s research, published in June in the journal Nature, suggests that hurricanes have been slowing down over the past 70 years. Why? “That’s the million dollar question,” Kossin says.

“That’s the million dollar question.”

In Florence’s case, there’s a high pressure system squatting to Florence’s north — which prevented Florence from moving up along the coast, and instead shunted it west onto land. That high pressure system is also exacerbating the storm’s stall. “Florence is caught between the winds wanting to blow it to the east, and that high pressure block preventing it from being blown in that direction,” says Charles Greene, a professor of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. “It’s kind of stuck.”

The scientists The Verge spoke to were generally reluctant to connect the dots between Florence’s slow motion crawl through the Carolinas, and global warming. Rising global temperatures could be one explanation, but that particular link to climate change is more controversial than the links to other hurricane characteristics.

“When it comes to hurricanes and global warming, what’s a very robust finding is that they get more intense,” says Dim Coumou, who leads the Atmospheric Circulation & Extreme Weather research group at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Warmer air also can contain more water vapor, which can lead to more torrential rainfall, he says. But when it comes to a hurricane’s pace as it travels from place to place, Coumou says, “There is more uncertainty there.”

Broadly speaking, we do know that with global warming, temperatures at the poles are climbing more than at lower latitudes. And as the difference in temperatures between the Arctic and the equator diminishes, so could the pressure gradient that drives large scale air currents like the jet stream. That could mean slower movement of weather systems, including hurricanes like Florence, according to Kossin.

“It’s worrying that we see more stalling hurricanes.”

Other climate scientists are picking up similar patterns. Michael Mann, professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, linked this amplified warming of the Arctic to jet stream behaviors “that are associated with the stalling of weather systems, including what we’ve seen with hurricanes over the past decade like Harvey, Irene, and now Florence,” Mann told The Verge in an email. The study, co-authored with Coumou, was published in the journal Scientific Reports in 2017.

Scientists are still figuring out the link — if there is a link — between hurricane travel time and climate change. On the one hand, Kossin says, it could be natural variability. On the other hand, he says, if there is “a human fingerprint on this linked to warming, then we would expect the slowing to continue — at least, that part of it caused by humans activity,” he says. But there’s certainly something going on. “It’s worrying that we see more stalling hurricanes and the slowdown of the circulation,” Coumou says. “That has to be understood.”","national oceanic and atmospheric administration

And oddly, this was happening when the phones were near a full charge, not when the battery was low. As reported by Android Police, initially it was assumed that this was some kind of minor bug in the latest version of Android, which was only released a few weeks ago. Some users thought they might’ve just enabled Battery Saver without realizing.

But it was actually Google at fault.

The company posted a message on Reddit last night acknowledging “an internal experiment to test battery saving features that was mistakenly rolled out to more users than intended.” So Google had remotely — and accidentally — changed a phone setting for a bunch of real-world customers. Several staffers at The Verge experienced the issue. “We have now rolled battery saver settings back to default. Please configure to your liking,” the Pixel team wrote on Reddit before apologizing for the error.

It makes sense that Google has this capability, but it still shouldn’t have happened

This wasn’t just limited to Pixel phones, however; devices including the Essential Phone, OnePlus 6, Nokia handsets, and others running Pie (even in beta form) switched Battery Saver on without any user action. According to Google, when active, Battery Saver:

Stops apps from refreshing content until you open them

Stops use of location services when the display is off

Prevents apps from doing things in the background

Delays some notifications

So that might’ve resulted in some frustration for users who didn’t even realize it was on.

Both Apple and Google have emergency means of forcing updates or making other changes to iOS and Android, respectively. It’s a necessary option to have at their disposal for user safety and security, and it’s not a new one. Way back in 2008, Steve Jobs confirmed that Apple had a kill switch option for malicious apps; he told The Wall Street Journal “hopefully we never have to pull that lever, but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull.” But it’s the silent and invasive nature of Google’s mistake that’s bothering people.

You’d hope there would be more walls between internal Android tests at Google and the Android OS that customers are using daily on their personal devices.","the wall street journal

This year’s iPhone event is done and dusted, and now we’re all sitting in the interregnum between the announcements and the reviews. I’ve been lucky enough to live blog these events for years, but the process of creating a live blog is weird. I was taking photos for the site during the keynote, and since I’m a “spray and pray” kind of photographer, I took upwards of 1,600 photos in just a couple of hours.

I point that out just to say that my attention was more focused on what Apple was doing than the reaction to it. I only had so much bandwidth, and most of it was taken up by the camera. So when I had a chance later to look at all the coverage (and Twitter jokes), it didn’t come as a huge surprise to see that there was a lot of shrugging this year. “S-year” keynotes often feel like downers to the tech world, even though S-model iPhones are often Apple’s most popular and well-loved devices.

Apple has a pattern, and it sticks with it

It’s certainly too early to say whether that sales pattern will repeat itself this year, but since my attention was dominated by the keynote, another kind of pattern crystalized for me as I was snapping away with the camera: Apple’s structure for announcing new features has a very specific and repeatable narrative structure.

So that’s what this week’s Processor (hey, it’s back!) is about. Maybe Apple’s framing technique was so easy to see because there were fewer product announcements this year, and the announcements that did happen were so straightforward. I saw Apple framing product announcements in a way very similar to how George Lakoff talks about politicians framing issues.

This year’s framing around the camera was especially fascinating. Arguably, the innovation on the iPhone XS that will be most noticeable to customers is the camera. And with that camera, Apple is trying to do some very similar stuff to what the Pixel 2 does: it takes multiple photos at once, it stitches them together, and it does more computation.

But you know what didn’t get mentioned at all during the keynote? Any other smartphone cameras. Apple would rather you frame the new iPhone as a thing that’s getting closer to replacing a DSLR, not as a thing that is in the scrum with other smartphone cameras. Apple sets the terms of the world and of the things that exist in it. That’s the frame.

Lakoff writes:

This gives us a basic principle of framing for when you are arguing against the other side: Do not use their language. Their language picks out a frame — and it won’t be the frame you want.

Once the frame is established, within that frame, Apple tells a story where one thing leads to the next. Here’s how that usually goes:

Talk about how great Apple products have always been Talk about specs and tech details on the new thing Talk about how Apple’s new thing will let you do amazing new things

Apple keeps doing these keynotes specifically to create that frame and tell that story. They don’t (just) exist so you will know what the new feature or product is; they exist so you can see yourself as a character in Apple’s story. They’re Apple’s best chance to set the terms of the discussion for its products.

Even in an S-year keynote, where the announcements aren’t that game-changing, Apple can still use this narrative-setting structure to shape how people think about their products. It might be even more important in an S-year.

The real point of the keynote is to make you see yourself as a character in Apple’s story

I don’t think that Apple is unique in consciously deploying a narrative frame as a technique, but I do think that the company has shown a deeper, more conscious awareness of its structure and importance than anybody else. It knows that most people will forget the feature but remember the story arc — or at least remember the feeling that story arc is meant to evoke.

To be clear, I’m not pointing out these rhetorical techniques because I think they’re somehow disingenuous. Apple may be deploying tactics we more often see in political discourse, but that doesn’t mean that it’s just propaganda. It’s marketing. And Apple has proven itself to be very good at marketing over the years.","and

You might have seen this absurd instrument when it went viral on YouTube earlier this year. It’s the creation of Sam Battle, aka Look Mum No Computer, a mad scientist of sorts who’s made a name for himself by modifying toys like these rows of slack-mouthed Furbies via a process called circuit bending. And, as he shows me around his studio pointing out other far-out circuit bent creations with a laissez-faire attitude — like his flamethrower synth — it quickly becomes clear he’s not driven by anything except sheer curiosity. It’s just how his brain is wired (pun intended).

“When you get the first thing to work, it’s amazing,” Battle says about circuit bending as his face lights up. “It’s magical!”

The wonderful and enticing thing about circuit bending is that it’s based upon chance

Circuit bending is the creative (and often experimental) process of taking apart old, battery-powered toys and synthesizers and fiddling around with the inner components to have them make unintended and new sounds. It was pioneered as a method of making music by musician and technologist Reed Ghazala in the 1960s. Ghazala himself was not the first to practice it, but he did conceive the term circuit bending later on, in 1992. It’s not as popular as it once was, and Battle is one of the few people currently circuit bending things on a scale as grand as the Furby organ.

The wonderful and enticing thing about circuit bending is that it’s based upon chance, and requires little to no technical knowledge in order to modify a thing to make unexpected sounds. Simply find an older, battery-operated audio toy or synth and pop it open. While it’s making noise, touch a printed circuit trace, component lead, or integrated circuit pin with a test lead (or even a licked finger!) and keep it in place while touching other parts of the circuitry. Eventually, you should hear a combination that interrupts the electricity and creates an interesting sound. At this point, if you want to have control over the new sound, you can solder the two points together with something like a pitch dial or toggle switch.

This is the basic idea of circuit bending, and Battle takes it to the extreme.

The circuit bending ethos of Frankensteining old things to create completely new instruments grew into a sizable community through the 2000s. There was such a demand that a market developed for bespoke companies to make custom circuit bent instruments for musicians like Beck, REM, Men Without Hats, BT, Bloc Party, and many more. Casio’s SK1 was a small sampling keyboard that was popular to customize, but one of the most ubiquitous items used for circuit bending was the Speak & Spell, an electronic educational toy with a speech synthesizer. People liked to poke around inside them due to the open inner design, how many sounds it was capable of making, and Texas Instruments’ choice to not restrict use of the toy’s language cartridges by region. It was also Battle’s introduction to the circuit bending world.

“I remember I was a real big fan of this guy called Casper Electronics,” Battle recalls. “He did a lot of Speak & Spell stuff and that taught me a lot of what to do with it; [How to] build other circuits onto the machine to make it even more circuit bent, and even more crazy, and do things it’s not intended to do in a musical form.”

Founded in 2000 by Pete Edwards, Casper Electronics created circuit bent musical instruments for musicians like Danny Elfman, Rahzel of The Roots, and Mike Patton of Faith No More. Speaking with Edwards, he echoes the same sentiments about why circuit bending took off. “The movement, I think,” he tells me, “was largely based on how novel it was that this thing does something you wouldn’t expect. [It] is this exploitation of this little window of time when the scale and complexity of electronics was just right. It was complex enough to do wild stuff, but simple enough that a little hack could make it malfunction in cool ways.”

“Modern toys [aren’t] as hackable as the old ones.”

At its height during the ‘90s and through the 2000s, circuit bending was a thriving DIY community that was even adopted by some of music’s biggest stars. But now it’s dwindled, and people like Battle are rarer to find. “Consumer electronics have evolved in a way that’s completely oblivious to these hacking practices and have moved away from hackability,” Edwards says. “They’re not as physically accessible. It’s just that simple. I was teaching circumventing workshops for about 10 years and I stopped because eventually, no one in the workshop could hack anything. There was nothing to bend, because the circuits just weren’t bendable anymore.”

Older toys and synths were easy to bend because they had exposed circuitry that used through-hole mounting — a process where component leads actually run through holes in a printed circuit board. Newer toys generally use surface mount technology, where components are attached directly to the surface of a board. That makes the leads tricker to get at. And, SMT components are smaller and harder to tell apart than through-hole components. All of this means they're simply harder to bend. Additionally, new toys tend to have most functions packed into fewer components and use purpose-built microprocessors (instead of generic components), which are usually hidden under a glob of epoxy.

This is why Battle’s studio looks like it’s been through a time warp, and is littered with old Game Boys, Commodore computers, and yes, Furbies. “Modern toys [aren’t] as hackable as the old ones,” laments Battle. “You can still hack them, but they require a different way to do it. It’s not usually as obvious.”

Because of all this, circuit bending isn’t as popular anymore, but the spirit that first spawned it still exists. Edwards says it’s now channeled elsewhere, in other artistic musical outlets that provide the same sense of satisfying exploration. “You find a medium that does it better,” says Edwards, “which is just simply modular synthesis.” One popular option, he says, is Eurorack, a standardized system of modules that can be connected with patch cables or switches to create custom synthesizers. “The Eurorack format is an extremely effective, highly experimental sound exploration medium. So, most people that made a real go at being professional circuit benders now make modules.”

Battle does make his own modules in addition to crazy things like a flamethrower synth. But even his more “practical” modules are injected with a bit of signature peculiarity. One side of his studio has a wall of handmade hardware that he carts along for live performances. In the middle of it is a block of black, dusty fur, with two bulging eyes and a pair of chatter teeth. Its name is Cosmo, and other modules can be patched to it in order to control the movements of the eyes and teeth.

I manage to glitch out a Furby into a fuzzed-out string of stutters

Over the course of the day with Battle, I get to try out a synth bike, we play around with his lightsaber theremins, and he even skins a fresh Furby so I can try out circuit bending for the first time. I delve in and quickly manage to glitch out the Furby into a fuzzed-out string of stutters. It’s incredibly fun to immediately hear the effects of blindly poking around a circuit board, but it can’t be ignored that I’m playing around with something that simply doesn’t exist anymore. Electronics have, as Edwards said, moved away from hackability, meaning for the most part you’d have to, like Battle, outfit yourself with old tech if you wanted to try it out.

Battle’s visions appear to represent a bridge between the previous generation of circuit benders and what its future could look like. Although many of Battle’s creations use the relics from the past that originally made circuit bending popular, there’s something singular and fresh about his pure curiosity and ability to transform toys into items of wonder. Technically, he’s also so good he’s managed to bend “unbendable” gadgets like the Wonder Bible audio player. “Right now I’m trying to take existing projects that I’ve had in my head and just make them larger,” Battle tells me. “Because I can, I guess. The only answer I have is, ‘Why not?’”

Is there a future for circuit bending? “I think, from the perspective of modifying kids’ toys, no, not really,” says Edwards. “But, from the perspective of people approaching consumer products and electronics with an adventurous spirit and finding new ways to use them, absolutely.”","and

The storm, which was downgraded to a tropical depression Sunday, has claimed at least 14 lives and stranded hundreds of people in floodwaters. It was still forecast to dump as much as 10 additional inches of rain on an already saturated region.

Rainfall totals could reach as high as 40 inches in southeastern North Carolina and 15 to 20 inches in the western part of the state. The downpour will produce flash flooding, river flooding and raise the risk of landslides, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Though Florence had crept at a snail’s pace across the region for days, it gained speed on Sunday, moving over the western Carolinas at 8 miles an hour. It is forecast to curve north over the Ohio Valley, stretching across Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia, on Monday and head toward the northeastern U.S.

But the water threat will persist for days, forecasters said. Flooding is expected to prompt more evacuations and continue requiring rescues, according to the National Weather Service. Submerged roads have cut off some communities, and low-lying bridges could be washed away.

A preliminary report from Swansboro, N.C., showed that more than 30 inches of rain had fallen so far, according to the hurricane center. That breaks the tropical cyclone rainfall record of 24.06 inches for North Carolina, which was set during Hurricane Floyd in 1999, it added.

“The rainfall is epic, and will continue to be,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper at a news conference Saturday. “We face walls of water, at our coast, along our rivers, across farmland, in our cities and in our towns.”

Florence has so far dropped 23.59 inches of rain on Wilmington, N.C., breaking the record for the wettest single weather event in the city’s history, according to the National Weather Service. As of Sunday morning, the annual rainfall total in the city had also broken the previous record, set in 1877.

In North Carolina, the deaths include a mother and infant killed in Wilmington, when a tree fell on a home, authorities said.

In South Carolina, a 61-year-old woman driving on a highway crashed into a toppled tree Friday. Authorities in the state later reported two more deaths from carbon-monoxide poisoning caused by a generator.

More than 700,000 customers lacked power in North Carolina, and another 120,000 outages were reported in South Carolina, according to emergency-management agencies. More than 28,000 people were staying in 220 shelters in the Carolinas.

Mr. Cooper said some rivers not expected to reach their highest points until early this week. “The water is rising fast everywhere, even in places that don’t typically flood,” he said. “Many people who think that the storm has missed them have yet to see its threat.”

Seven rivers in North Carolina are forecast to reach major flooding levels in the coming days, according to a report by Rick Neuherz, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service. Some, like the Cape Fear River and Lumber River, could set flooding records, he wrote.

On Saturday, Cumberland County, the city of Fayetteville and the town of Wade issued a mandatory evacuation order for all people within a mile of the banks of the Cape Fear and Little Rivers because of flooding risk.

James Trogdon, the state’s transportation secretary, said numerous counties had closed primary roads, and portions of interstate highways were shut.

“Road conditions across nearly all of our state will be rapidly deteriorating in the coming days,” Mr. Trogdon said. In his entire career, he said, he had “never seen flash flooding like this in our state.”

Federal officials said Saturday that while Florence had weakened, its dangers hadn’t. “What we’re dealing with here is a major flooding and rain event. At this point, we’re also looking at potential landslides,” Neil Jacobs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told a news conference.

Jeffrey Byard, associate director at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Florence would be costly, in part because of the sheer volume of water it is unleashing and its slow movement.

President Trump approved a major disaster declaration on Saturday, freeing up federal funding for affected areas. He is expected to travel to areas affected by the storm the coming week, the White House said Friday.

North Carolina’s agriculture industry and environmental groups are closely watching for signs of heavy rains breaching hog waste “lagoons,” which could pose a threat to drinking water. As of late Friday, the North Carolina Pork Council said rainfall hadn’t exceeded the lagoons’ capacity.

Smithfield Foods Inc., the largest U.S. pork producer, said it was assessing the impact. Smithfield’s slaughtering and processing plants so far appear undamaged, but for the company’s farms, “it’ll take some time before we’ll be able to visit every site,” a spokeswoman said.

Powerless As of Saturday evening, nearly 9 percent of the more than 5 million customers served by major electricity providers in the Carolinas remained without power. Percent reporting power outages 12% 10 8 6 4 7:00 a.m. Friday Hurricane Florence makes landfall 2 Midnight Friday Noon Noon Midnight Saturday

In Wilmington, hundreds of trees, including large oaks, collapsed, blocking roadways. Long lines formed at the sole grocery store to open on College Road, near the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.

Sabrina Wood, a 36-year-old mother of two, said she needed milk, bread and beer. She waited in line about 30 minutes in the rain but said it was a welcome respite after being cooped up for 48 hours in a small house with bored children.

“I’ve been through plenty of storms, but this is the longest one I’ve been through,” Ms. Wood said. “It’s treacherous. It’s stressful.”

South Carolina had, for the most part, fared better. Gov. Henry McMaster lifted evacuation orders for all affected counties except two: Horry and Georgetown, in the Myrtle Beach area. Those remaining evacuation orders were scheduled to be lifted Sunday morning.

But officials warned residents needed to remain vigilant for possible flooding in the coming days. They were keeping close watch in particular on the Pee Dee River Basin, in the northeastern part of the state.

Residents of inland South Carolina awoke Sunday morning to heavy rains and swelling rivers. Parts of I-95 were closed off by flooding, and local road closures are likely to complicate access into and out of flooded areas in the state’s northeastern region, officials said.

In Florence County, which on Saturday lifted evacuation orders in flood-prone areas, officials said they feared residents may now be in peril. “Everybody says, ‘Oh boy, this is over,’ and went home, and now they’re trapped,” said Sam Brockington, the county’s fire and emergency services coordinator.

Florence’s torrential rain and storm surges flood block after block in New Bern, N.C., leaving feet of water inside many houses. Where the water had receded by Friday morning, debris remained–a pack of cards here, a doll there, a scattering of plastic utensils, even an unopened loaf of bread still dry inside its bag. One man found a carport standing in his yard; it wasn’t his.

Residents surveyed the damage, wading through mud and, in some places, knee-deep water, to get a look at their homes. Some were still dry inside, others had been leveled, their roofs crumpled on the ground.

Some who found dry interiors contemplated returning home after a few nights at a shelter or with relatives. They said they weren’t worried about additional flooding from Florence’s continuing rains upstream, which would send more water through New Bern’s rivers.

“I thought I was going to ride it out,” said David Jones. “When they sent a rescue boat out here, I got on it.”

That was Thursday night. He was back Saturday, and looking to stay.

“There’s no way it’s going to get as high up as it was,” he said, gesturing to the high water mark on his shed—above head height.

Herbert Simmons, 65 years old, also was evacuated by boat Thursday night.

“There was just too much water,” he said. It lapped at the underside of the stairs leading up to the door of his raised house, perhaps six feet high.

Jerry Jones walked Saturday around the neighborhood, one of several volunteers who drove in Friday night looking to help local first responders. On Saturday, he and two others surveyed the damage to a grid of blocks near the Neuse River, where they were knocking on doors to check on residents who might need help.

Elizabeth Jones, 83, clasps the hand of her neighbor, David Morgan, outside of their homes on Simmons Street in New Bern, which were flooded. “You see this stuff on TV,” Morgan said. “You don’t really know devastation until it happens to you.” Morgan and Jones were back at their homes during a lull in the flooding, retrieving belongings. The water came in as they were sleeping, Morgan said, and they had to leave in a hurry. “Just didn’t have time to grab more stuff,” he said. ”We learned a lot from this,” he added. “I never dreamed this would happen,”Elizabeth Jones said, seated in the car. She was evacuated by the National Guard two nights ago. Photo: Veasey Conway for The Wall Street Journal

“They say they want to stay, this is their home,” Mr. Jones said of those he encountered. “They done got through the worst part.”

Betsy Golden, 77, was among the neighbors who left ahead of the storm, but on Saturday she sat in a truck outside her white house taking in the destruction to her block.

“I had the chance to come see what happened, so I took it,” she said.

Watermarks show the floodwater had been about knee high in her house, which her brother had had raised some years back. Back when she was a teenager, she recalled, water swept in by Hurricane Hazel in 1954 only had come up to the windowsills.

“When I was young, I didn’t realize what it meant for people to lose everything,” she said. “Now that I’m older, I understand what it’s like to lose everything that you’ve worked to gain.”

Seeing the damage in her house on Saturday, Ms. Golden said, left her feeling lost.

“You have to start all over again,” she said. “I hope FEMA does a good job. You hear horror stories.”

In Wilmington, Rochel Williams and James Moore surveyed the damage to their home on Friday after their front porch collapsed and the roof flew off in the early hours as Hurricane Florence made landfall.

The engaged couple first noticed leaking from light fixtures in the ceiling and decided to evacuate their rental home with their two children, ages 16 and 12.

“We woke up the kids in just the nick of time,” said Ms. Williams, 36. “As soon as we got out, the front part of our roof flew off.”

Gov. Roy Cooper’s plea came hours after immediate, mandatory evacuations were ordered along the Cape Fear and Little Rivers, including residents of Fayetteville and Cumberland County. The Cape Fear River is set to reach unprecedented flooding levels in the coming days, and officials warned of “life-threatening flooding” and “imminent danger.”

The prevailing message from officials: Despite the storm’s lessening force, the worst may be yet to come. In addition to perilous road conditions, flood waters from across the region are pouring into river basins already swollen with rain from Florence.

“Road conditions across nearly all of our state will be rapidly deteriorating in the coming days,” with flooding moving from east to west, said James Trogden, the secretary of North Carolina’s Department of Transportation. In his entire career, he said, “I have never seen flash flooding like this in our state.”

More than 15 miles of Interstate 95 in the state have already been closed because of flooding.

Mr. Cooper advised residents who had evacuated coastal areas against returning home, even if the evacuation order had been lifted. “It isn’t safe for you to get there,” he said.

That is one of the main takeaways from an examination of the economic effects of storms in recent years.

With Hurricane Florence hitting the U.S. East Coast, and potentially more storms to come in the weeks ahead, it is a time to assess the economic impacts of natural disasters.

Hurricane Harvey last year flooded the nation’s fourth-largest city by population, Houston, destroying $125 billion worth of property, according to estimates by Moody’s Analytics Inc. But lost economic output was just $8.5 billion, a barely perceptible sliver of more than $19 trillion of national economic output, according to Moody’s.

For the U.S. economy as a whole, output grew at a healthy 2.8% rate in the quarter when Harvey hit Texas. Payroll employment growth slowed in the weeks after Harvey, rising just 14,000 in September, and then bounced back with growth of 271,000 the following month. Individual claims for unemployment benefits briefly climbed, and then resumed a trend of shrinking to historic lows.

Studies show that business might slow down during and immediately after storms hit. Restaurants and clothing stores lost foot traffic on the Atlantic coast after Hurricane Matthew in 2016, according to a Federal Reserve study.

However, before long, rebuilding and restocking starts, leading to car purchases and construction that boost economic activity to replace property that was wiped out. Houston saw sectors like retail, restaurants and trade recover quickly. Matthew led to a bump in grocery-store sales before and after the storm.

Economic growth is not a proxy for well-being, and natural disasters like hurricanes destroy lives and wealth even if they don’t make a huge dent in the nation’s economic output. Money spent on property repairs may boost gross domestic product in the short-term, but it comes at the expense of discretionary spending households would have chosen instead.

And some local economies can be devastated by a storm and bear long-running scars, especially ones plagued by poverty or poor infrastructure. Employment in Puerto Rico dropped 35,000 after Hurricane Maria last year and still hasn’t recovered. In New Orleans, shocked in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina, employment and economic output still haven’t returned to pre-Katrina levels.

But even in those cases, local devastation typically doesn’t hit the national economy. When Katrina hit New Orleans, the broader economy grew at a robust 3.6% annual rate, one of the best quarters in the last expansion. Property damage from Katrina—at $161 billion—far outnumbered lost economic output—at $31 billion—according to Moody’s.

A 2014 study on the economic impact of Katrina by economists Tatyana Deryugina, Laura Kawano and Steven Levitt found that Katrina destroyed more than 200,000 homes and had large and persistent impacts on where people live—yet the impact on the wage income, employment and total income of the individuals affected by the storm was “small and mostly transitory.”

“Within just a few years, Katrina victims’ incomes fully recover and even surpass that of controls from similar cities that were unaffected by the storm,” the research found.

Businesses in hurricane-affected states also tend to adapt. “If you’re a manufacturer and you’re sourcing materials for your process and you normally get them in South Carolina [or] in North Carolina...you might make a call and say, ‘Hey, can we get these from somewhere else?’ ” said Ben Herzon, economist at Macroeconomic Advisers.

Economic impacts depend in part on where storms hit. Gulf-coast storms threaten to damage U.S. energy infrastructure, pushing up fuel prices for households and businesses nationally. Every penny increase in gasoline reduces consumer spending nationally by $1 billion over the course of a year, estimates Ryan Sweet, economist at Moody’s Analytics. East Coast storms don’t bear the same risk.

That all leaves an encouraging prognosis for Florence’s economic impact. There is energy infrastructure in Florence’s path, he said, including an oil refinery and liquid natural gas terminal in Savannah, Ga., up to 12 nuclear power plants, and natural-gas storage in Savannah, Charleston, S.C., and Wilmington, N.C. Still, he said, “I don’t think this hurricane’s impact on U.S. energy prices nationally will be as significant as Harvey was.”

Economic might is also less concentrated in Florence’s path. Charleston was the 73rd-largest metropolitan economy by gross domestic product in 2016, Myrtle Beach was 144th and Wilmington was 162nd.

In all, Florence’s projected path through North Carolina, South Carolina and parts of Virginia and Georgia could impact 5% to 10% of the U.S. population, said Mr. Sweet.

Though the imprints of hurricanes on the broader economy are rarely significant, these events can cause mayhem in economic statistics, making it harder for policy makers to read them. U.S. purchases of cars grew at a 16.6% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter last year in part because households were replacing vehicles lost in storms, and then dropped at a 12.7% annual rate in the first quarter. That led to a surge in measures of overall economic output and then a slowdown.

At the Fed’s late-January policy meeting, nearly five months after Harvey, policy makers were still trying to sort through the statistical noise. “It was noted that spending on durable goods to replace those damaged during the hurricanes in September may have provided a temporary boost to consumer spending,” minutes of the Fed’s meeting said.

That means that while the storm itself might not upend a long-running expansion, economists could be talking about Florence for months to come.

A woman trapped in a trailer, and another stuck in an attic. Thirty people at a hospital needing transport to a shelter; a dozen or so at a church.

A crew from the Army National Guard’s 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team—their camouflage uniforms already drenched from a night and day of rescues—loaded into a pair of massive tactical trucks outside the city’s main fire station and rolled out Friday evening.

At the nearby CarolinaEast Medical Center, they were all business as they helped more than a dozen residents up a ladder into one truck’s cloth-covered back.

“What’s your name?” Sgt. Alex Park asked as people filed past, some wrapped in garbage bags and blankets against the driving rain. “Name, sir?”

“One, two, three,” Sgt. Nicholas Muhar told a little girl as she was swung by another guardsman into his grasp.

Florence, downgraded to a tropical storm on Friday, inundated New Bern as the storm swept ashore Friday morning, bringing storm surges nearly 11 feet high. Its 90 mph winds ripped shingles from houses, and toppled trees and power lines, leaving the city’s 22,000 municipal electricity customers powerless.

Amid the chaos, rescuers worked almost nonstop. Help came from agencies near and far, including Georgia, Missouri, New York and Texas.

After dropping a large group of people at a shelter, the crew from the National Guard’s 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team, known as Old Hickory, went back to the hospital for more, including two men who said they had to swim from their flooded homes.

The team was working on maybe four hours of sleep and a snack here and there, Sgt. Muhar said. By early Friday evening, they had already rescued nearly 150 people. Some of the swift-boat guys, he added, had roughly double that tally.

“We’ve just been running and running and running,” said Sgt. Muhar, who took a pragmatic view of the missions. “It’s just: next thing, next thing, next thing. Just do it. Get it done.”

The next thing, it turned out, was a rescue of another tactical vehicle mired in chest-deep floodwaters in a residential neighborhood next to Jack Smith Creek, just blocks from the Neuse River.

“Back in the truck!” someone yelled, as the team prepared to head out just after 8 p.m.

As the vehicle entered the rising floodwaters, Sgt. Muhar cautioned:

“Hey guys, it’s gonna get real deep out here.”

The truck plowed along slowly, its headlights often the only illumination as the team passed houses with water lapping at the bottom of their windowsills. As they came upon on the mired truck, tilted sideways into the water, several of the team hopped out to guide their own vehicle into towing range. Headlamps and glow sticks attached to their hard hats pinpointed their positions as the team worked to winch the stranded truck out of trouble.

“Alright, he’s out,” someone called, as they righted the vehicle and began walking it toward drier ground.

Back at the main fire station a short time later, the men conferred with local emergency responders about their availability for night duty, their faces drawn with fatigue, their uniforms sopping wet.

But one piece of information had Sgt. Muhar smiling.

“You guys got a shower? You got a dryer?” he asked, getting a nod from one of the New Bern responders. “Yes! I’m happy!”

FEMA Administrator Brock Long is the target of an internal investigation looking into frequent travel between the nation’s capital and his home in Hickory, N.C., according to people briefed on the probe. The investigation included surveilling Mr. Long as he was driven 400 miles each way on his commute, the people said.

Investigators have told administration officials that Mr. Long, while under surveillance, often left agency headquarters on Thursdays and traveled home with a caravan of federal workers, who stayed in nearby hotels for the long weekend, the people said. He has spent about 150 days in North Carolina since he took over the job last year, which included weekends and time-off, the people said.

Mr. Long declined, through a spokeswoman, to comment on Friday. He has previously denied any wrongdoing and he didn’t attend a pair of FEMA news conferences Friday afternoon about the storm.

The White House has begun discussing potential replacements for Mr. Long, a senior White House official said.

At a media briefing on Thursday, Mr. Long said he “would never intentionally run a program incorrectly” and pledged to cooperate with the investigation, and that he and the agency were “100% focused” on the approaching storm. “That’s exactly where our attention needs to be from the standpoint of the life safety mission,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security inspector general is also reviewing communications between Mr. Long and a FEMA contractor that appear to include discussions about future employment, said one of the people briefed on the investigation. Investigators are also looking into an accident involving an SUV, owned by the federal government and used to transport the director, that wasn’t property reported, the person said.

Mr. Long was informed last fall by DHS attorneys and the inspector general that his trips home violated the law, the people said. The inspector general’s office has told administration officials that they tailed Mr. Long’s caravan to determine whether he was using federal resources to return home despite the warnings, the person briefed on the investigation said.

The inspector general’s final report is expected in the coming days, but preliminary findings have been shared with DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, administration officials said. The existence of the investigation was first reported by Politico on Thursday.

Ms. Nielsen brought details of the preliminary findings to Mr. Long and urged him to resign if the allegations were accurate, one administration official said. Another official familiar with the situation disputed that the secretary made that suggestion to Mr. Long.

A DHS spokesman declined to address the allegations, referring questions to the inspector general’s office. The inspector general’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment.

“At this time, we are fully focused on preparing for, responding to, and recovering from Hurricane Florence and the storms in the Pacific,” DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton said in a statement. “The secretary is confident in the leadership at FEMA and their proven disaster management ability.”

Senior White House officials discussed replacing Mr. Long in the past several days, according to one person familiar with the matter. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly ultimately decided to leave Mr. Long in place until the final report was available, the person said. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.

President Trump has been meeting with Mr. Long regularly in recent days as Hurricane Florence prompted flooding and heavy rains on the Southeast coast. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump praised his FEMA director as someone “who’s done so well for us” during storms that hit Texas and Florida last year.

Inside FEMA, Mr. Long is well liked. Several FEMA officials said privately that they felt conflicted about reports of his travel.

One FEMA official said Friday the administrator has national-security duties, and the use of government vehicles supports that effort and allows for him to ensure classified communication. The official also said that in previous administrations, using vehicles in a similar fashion was routine practice. Officials were working to resolve any discrepancies in the use of specialized vehicles and federal laws, the official said.

Mr. Long joined the administration when Ms. Nielsen was chief of staff at DHS and Mr. Kelly was the secretary. Previously, Mr. Long was an executive at Hagerty Consulting, an Illinois-based emergency-management consulting firm with offices in Washington. Mr. Long also ran the Alabama Emergency Management Agency and was an emergency-management official in Georgia. He also has previously worked at FEMA.

Mr. Long is the latest Trump administration official to face questions about improper use of federal resources while traveling.

Scott Pruitt, the former EPA administrator, resigned in July amid allegations of ethical lapses and improper spending, including $163,000 on first-class flights, military aircraft and charter flights. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned last September over his extensive use of private jets and military flights.

There’s an App for That,https://www.wsj.com/articles/stranded-in-a-hurricane-theres-an-app-for-that-1536963753,https://images.wsj.net/im-26546/social,business,2018-09-16 14:23:31.214622,"Carolina residents in the path of Florence have turned to technology and social media to stay connected—and even call for help.

Zello Inc.’s mobile app, which lets people use their phones like walkie-talkies, shot to the No. 1 spot in Apple Inc.’s app store in recent days. The app became popular last year during Hurricanes Harvey and Irma when volunteer rescue teams used it to field distress calls.

Many of those same volunteers, known as the Cajun Navy, along with those from the Carolinas, are using the app to communicate with people in harm’s way.

Zello lets people use their phone like a push-to-talk walkie-talkie to speak with other users directly. Users can also subscribe to public channels—kind of like a chat room but for voice—where groups of people can talk. The Cajun Navy, for example, has a channel that allows people to make distress calls.

“The Zello app has been a lord and savior,” said Donald Lewis, a 33-year-old restaurant manager and volunteer from Wilmington, N.C. “We’ve been able to rescue multiple people and multiple animals.”

The volunteers have been taking requests for help through Zello and by phone, Mr. Lewis said. He said he went out on a call on Thursday night to help a man who was injured by a tree that fell through the roof of his house, knocking him out of his bed. On Friday morning, he took an elderly woman in need of oxygen to the hospital and later rescued a dog and kitten, he said.

Zello CEO Bill Moore said daily use of the app has surged by a factor of 20 in the Carolinas in recent days. The app, which was released in 2012, was also popular in Egypt, Ukraine and Venezuela during times of crisis, he said.

“It worked especially well for Harvey and Irma,” Mr. Moore said. “At that point Zello was known as a hub for emergency communication.”

Some Carolina residents have been using Zello to stay in touch with neighbors who hunkered down during the storm and others who left town.

Rhonda Knopf, 45 years old, from Wilmington, said she and neighbors have been using Zello throughout the storm to exchange the latest information on what was happening in the community, such as the location of downed trees and when the power went out.

“A lot of the people in the neighborhood have gone to Florida, Atlanta, Charlotte and Tennessee,” Ms. Knopf said. “We’ve been able to communicate with them and let them know what’s going on in Wilmington.”

Zello requires a Wi-Fi or a cellphone signal, so users can’t count on it if those services go out. But Ms. Knopf said she hasn’t lost cell service during the storm.

Rob Johnson, 40, from New Bern, N.C., has been using Zello to keep in touch with his neighbors and trade messages with people who need help or are having medical issues. He also praised volunteers in the area using it to field distress calls.

“You have some amazing people on there,” Mr. Johnson said. “They are working their butts off.”

Social-media sites like Facebook have also come in handy. On a break at New Bern’s Fire Department headquarters Friday afternoon, Sgt. Kodi McKinney with the Army National Guard was trying to pull up Facebook to see if any locals were requesting assistance.

“We had a woman that was trapped in a trailer and that’s how we got it, through Facebook,” he said of the rescue request. He estimated that his team has conducted around 75 rescues since Thursday night.

Florence continued to drench the Carolinas on Saturday as it lumbered across the region, claiming at least six lives and stranding hundreds of people in floodwaters.

The storm moved at a 3-mile-an-hour crawl over eastern South Carolina on Saturday, producing severe flooding, according to the National Hurricane Center. It is forecast to soak the Carolinas throughout the weekend, dumping as much as 40 inches of rain along the coast south of Cape Hatteras. The deluge triggered “catastrophic flash flooding” and significant river flooding, the hurricane center said.

Authorities are worried about flooding, both from rainfall and the storm surge. Some of the highest waters could come around the Pamlico Sound, in North Carolina’s Outer Banks, and the rivers that empty there.

A preliminary report from Swansboro, N.C., showed that more than 30 inches of rain had fallen so far, according to the NHC. That breaks the tropical cyclone rainfall record of 24.06 inches for North Carolina, which was set during Hurricane Floyd in 1999, it added.

“Do not focus on the wind category,” the National Hurricane Center tweeted Thursday. “Life-threatening storm surge flooding, catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding are still expected.”

As it barreled toward the East Coast, Hurricane Florence was driving fierce winds, tides and rain made more powerful by the consequences of long-term climate change and the natural fickleness of the weather, researchers said.

A unique—and potentially deadly—combination of weather patterns and coastal geography was adding to the uncertainty about where exactly the storm will make landfall, how its intensity might change once it arrived and where it would go inland.

Hurricanes that menace the Carolinas usually follow a similar pattern: first moving toward Caribbean islands and then heading north off the east coast of Florida and Georgia, often weakening as they pull in dry continental air.

Not Florence, which barreled across open ocean straight to the Southeast U.S.

North and South Carolina have been subject to some of the most damaging hurricanes to hit the U.S. since the 1950s.

Many of those—including Agnes, Fran and Floyd—followed the more south-to-north track. Hurricane Hugo, which followed a similar route as Florence, caused damages estimated at $8 billion in 1989.

“The rainfall is epic, and will continue to be,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper at a news conference Saturday morning. “We face walls of water, at our coast, along our rivers, across farmland, in our cities and in our towns.”

Mr. Cooper said dangers from flooding were increasing, with some rivers not expected to crest until early next week. “The water is rising fast everywhere, even in places that don’t typically flood,” he said. “Many people who think that the storm has missed them have yet to see its threat.”","pa pa wva wva va va atlantic ocean tenn tenn nc

The storm side-swiped the semiautonomous region of Hong Kong en route to China’s Guangdong province, where it made landfall Sunday evening with winds still roaring at 100mph.

The biggest storm of the year has been downgraded from a “super” to a “severe” typhoon, but it is still considered a “high threat,” and Hong Kong maintained its highest storm warning of Level 10 through Sunday afternoon as winds of up to 117 miles per hour rattled the city’s skyline. Thirty-four people were injured with no declared fatalities as of noon local time, Bloomberg reports.

On Saturday, the toll was far worse: Mangkhut tore across the Cagayan Valley of the Philippines’ Luzon island, a storm-prone agricultural region that produces mostly rice and corn, with winds and rain equivalent to a Category 5 Atlantic hurricane. While the impact took some edge off the storm, Mangkhut mustered more strength as it churned across the South China Sea.

An estimated 270,000 people were affected by the storm in the Philippines, with 150,000 people displaced, according to government statistics. The country was battered by sustained winds that reached 96 mph, with gusts of up to 118 mph, according to the Associated Press. At least 28 people were reportedly killed, mostly by landslides and collapsed buildings.

The storm made its closest brush with Hong Kong in the early afternoon, side-swiping the densely populated city on its way to China’s Guangdong province. The semiautonomous region braced for “fierce winds” and “intense” downpours as the storm moved west-northwest at roughly 8 miles per hour, according to the Hong Kong Observatory.

Rainfall is expected to exceed 2 inches per hour and storm surges of up to 11.5 feet may reach the city’s central Victoria Harbor waterfront. Hong Kong Security Minister John Lee Ka-chiu said city authorities should “prepare for the worst.”

“Because Mangkhut will bring winds and rains of extraordinary speeds, scope and severity, our preparation and response efforts will be greater than in the past,” Ka-chiu said, according to the Associated Press.

Residents have been advised not to go outside and many have prepared to shelter until the storm passes, reinforcing windows with tape and emptying grocery store shelves of all but a few non-essential items. Streets were empty Sunday as howling winds brought heaping rain against the city’s shuttered buildings.

More than 500 flights have been canceled affecting some 96,000 passengers, according to the South China Morning Post. Ferry services and most bus lines were also suspended, Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK reports.

More than 700 people sought relief in government storm shelters, according to RTHK, but many others in flood-prone coastal areas like Tai-O fishing village resolved to ride out the storm, fortifying their homes with flood barriers and hoping for minimal impact.

“My mum used to live on a boat,” one resident told the Post. “She knows if we will need to evacuate.”

The village on Hong Kong’s Lantau Island experienced catastrophic flooding during last year’s Typhoon Hato, which caused up to HK$8 million ($1 million) in damage. The nearby gambling enclave of Macau suffered extensive damage and at least nine deaths.

Taiwan was spared the brunt of the storm as Mangkhut tracked southwest, but its weather bureau said the island’s southernmost Pingtung county was soaked by more than three feet of rain. One woman is reportedly missing after being swept out to sea in Taiwan’s northeastern Yilan county.

Mangkhut made landfall again near the Chinese port city of Yangjiang shortly after 5:00p.m. local time Sunday evening, according to AP. Nearly half a million people have been evacuated from seven cities in Guangdong province, AP reports, while China’s National Meteorological Center issued a red alert hours before the storm is expected to collide with the mainland.","victoria harbor waterfront hong kong

Juan David Ortiz, 35, an intel supervisor for the Border Patrol, was charged with four counts of murder and aggravated assault and unlawful restraint, Webb County District Attorney Isidro Alaniz said in a tweet.

Ortiz was arrested after the fifth woman managed to flee. State troopers found Ortiz hiding in a truck in a hotel parking lot in Laredo at around 2 a.m. Saturday. The border city is about 145 miles (235 kilometers) southwest of San Antonio.

“We do consider this to be a serial killer,” Alaniz said.

Alaniz said that after the suspect picked up the fifth woman she quickly realized that she was in danger.

“When she tried to escape from him at a gas station that’s when she ran into a (state) trooper,” Alaniz said.

He said that authorities believe Ortiz had killed all four women since Sept. 3. The names of the victims were not immediately released. Alaniz said two of them were U.S. citizens but the nationalities of the other two were not yet known. All of them were working as prostitutes and one was a transgender woman, he said.

“The manner in which they were killed is similar in all the cases from the evidence,” said Alaniz.

He declined to discuss the evidence or say how the women were killed.

Alaniz said investigators are still trying to determine a motive for the killings. Authorities said they believe Ortiz acted alone.

“It’s interesting that he would be observing and watching as law enforcement was looking for the killer, that he would be reporting to work every day like normal,” Alaniz said.

Ortiz was a 10-year veteran of the Border Patrol. U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a statement saying that it was fully cooperating with the investigation.

“Our sincerest condolences go out to the victims’ family and friends. While it is CBP policy to not comment on the details of an ongoing investigation, criminal action by our employees is not, and will not be tolerated,” the agency said.

The Texas Department of Public Safety, whose Texas Rangers are investigating, did not return several messages seeking comment.","texas department of public safety whose texas rangers

Preliminary reports from the National Weather Service say that as of noon on Saturday, over 30 inches of rain has fallen in Swansboro, N.C. Florence’s 30 inches of rainfall has broken the statewide rainfall record set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 of 24.06 inches.

Florence made landfall on the North Carolina coast Friday morning with wind speeds of 195 mph. As of Saturday morning, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) downgraded Florence to a tropical storm with maximum wind speeds of 45 mph and said heavy rains and catastrophic flooding will continue across portions of North and South Carolina.

NHC said wind speeds are expected to continue to slow down during the weekend but rainfall will increase in certain areas. The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings all across the Carolinas, including Moore County and Lee County. NWS warns residents living in areas with flash flood warnings to avoid roads.

“Turn around,” the advisory said. “Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become unstable and unsafe. Flash flooding is extremely dangerous. If you are experiencing flooding or live in a flood prone area, move to higher ground.”

According to a 2014 study from the American Meteorological Society, storm surge and rain are the cause of 76% of direct deaths from hurricanes. The study found that from 1963 to 2012 90% of deaths occurred in water related incidents, mostly drowning.","american meteorological society

Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand in Cleveland, Obama said the consequences of sitting on the sidelines during November’s midterm elections “are far more dangerous” than in the past.

Without mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama said, “This is not normal what we’re seeing. It is radical.” He said a continuation of Republican control in Washington would threaten Medicaid, affordable health care, even democracy.

“On November 6th, we have a chance to restore some sanity to our politics,” Obama said. “We can flip the balance of power back to the American people. Because you are the only check on bad policy, you are the only real check on abuses of power. It’s you and your vote.”

Obama was in closely divided Ohio to campaign for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray, running mate Betty Sutton, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and the party’s statewide slate. Cordray, who was Obama’s appointee to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is locked in a tight contest for governor against Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine. Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich is term-limited.

Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, was in the state Thursday to raise money for DeWine and Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, who is seeking to unseat Brown in the Senate.

In Cleveland, Cordray pledged to the crowd that he and his party would fight for decency, tolerance, inclusion and respectfulness if elected, declaring, “Change is coming.”

Obama drew a contrast between Cordray’s polite — some say boring — style and the president’s. He said many Ohio farmers “have money in their pockets” because of Cordray’s work at the consumer bureau.

“He didn’t try to take credit for it. He didn’t tweet about it. He just did it,” Obama said. “And if you elect him your governor, he will keep working like that — on your behalf.”

Obama said this fall’s elections are more important than any he can remember. “Each time we move in the direction of greater freedoms and greater prosperity for all people, the status quo pushes back. The powerful and the privileged oftentimes want to keep us divided, work to keep us angry and cynical, because that helps them hold onto their power and privilege.”

Republicans rejected Democrats’ arguments.

“2016 is over, but President Obama continues to dismiss the millions of voters across Ohio who rejected a continuation of his policies in favor of President Trump’s plan for historic tax cuts, new jobs and soaring economic growth,” said Mandi Merritt, Ohio spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. “Richard Cordray, Obama’s former regulator-in-chief, would just be more of the same of the outdated Obama-era policies that hurt Ohio families.”","republican national committee “richard cordray

Fire departments responded Thursday to about 150 emergency calls that included 60 to 80 structure fires in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, where thousands of residents were forced to evacuate. And at least one Lawrence resident, 18-year-old Leonel Rondon, was killed because of a home explosion.

“From a public safety perspective, this incident is stabilizing,” Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said at a press conference Friday morning. “At this point, all fires from yesterday afternoon and last night have been extinguished and are out. And there have been no new gas-related fires since yesterday evening and night.”

Columbia Gas said Friday morning that its crews were working to visit the 8,600 affected customers to shut off every gas meter and conduct a safety inspection, asking residents not to re-enter their houses until accompanied by a Columbia representative. But as of Friday at 3 p.m., Columbia Gas had shut off service to 3,230 customers so far.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera slammed Columbia Gas at a press conference Friday afternoon, accusing the company of failing to develop a coherent response plan or provide clear answers about what happened. “Since yesterday, when we first got word of this incident, the least informed and the last to act has been Columbia Gas,” Rivera said, calling on the company to hold a public meeting by 4 p.m. Friday. “They’re hiding from the problem.”

At a press conference later that afternoon Steve Bryant, president of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, defended the company’s response to the explosions, while acknowledging that it had yet to shut off service to more than than half of the affected customers. He said he expected to have reached all 8,600 customers by Saturday or Sunday, at which time residents would be able to return home.

“We’ve advanced this as rapidly as it could possibly be advanced. I don’t think that anybody else managing this would have been any further down the road than we are at the moment,” Bryant said. “We are sorry. We’re sorry and deeply concerned about the inconvenience. This is the sort of thing that a gas distribution company hopes never happens.”

Baker said Friday that the state was continuing to bring in hundreds of natural gas technicians to check each building in the affected neighborhoods before restoring power. “We ask for continued patience as this important work is done,” Baker tweeted. “Once utilities secure the affected areas, we will work with the federal government to investigate how this occurred and hold people accountable for their actions.”

Here’s what we know so far:

What happened?

Firefighters responded to 60 to 80 structure fires caused by gas explosions in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover on Thursday, officials said.

Emergency officials said Friday that an investigation by state and federal agencies, including the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), into the gas explosions was ongoing.

“Our mission is to find out what happened, so that we can learn from it and keep it from happening it again,” NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said at a press conference Friday. “We’re not there to point fingers, to lay blame, to assign fault. We are here to conduct a safety investigation.”

Sumwalt said the NTSB would be investigating the design of the gas pipeline system and any pipeline maintenance that was in progress, as well as its integrity management system.

The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency blamed over-pressurized gas lines for starting the fires, but said Friday morning that there was not yet any information about what caused the over-pressurization.

At a press conference Friday afternoon, Bryant, the president of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, directed reporters to the NTSB, deferring questions about the cause and whether the explosions could have been prevented.

Video footage from the scene showed firefighters working to put out the massive infernos, which appeared to fully engulf many of the homes.

Lawrence police Chief Roy Vasque told local newspaper The Eagle-Tribune that he had “never seen anything like this.” Andover Fire Chief Michael Mansfield told reporters the explosions “looked like Armageddon,” according to the Associated Press.

Was anyone injured in the house explosions near Boston?

At least 25 people, including a firefighter, were injured by the fires, the Associated Press reported.

Leonel Rondon, an 18-year-old Lawrence resident, was sitting in a car with friends when a nearby house exploded, and the chimney fell on his car, the Boston Globe reported, citing a spokesperson for Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett’s office. Rondon had been sitting in the car with three people, one of whom injured her legs and remains hospitalized, the Globe reported.

Rondon, who had just earned his driver’s license and had a job interview coming up on Sunday, was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

One person in critical condition was transported to a Boston trauma center. And more than a dozen victims were also treated at Lawrence General Hospital for minor injuries, as well as “smoke inhalation and blast trauma,” the hospital said in a tweet Thursday night.","national transportation safety board ntsb

It’s usually just enough to cover an electric bill or a car payment. This financial juggling is now a part of her everyday life—something she never expected almost two decades ago when she earned a master’s degree in secondary education and became a high school history teacher. Brown often works from 5 a.m. to 4 p.m. at her school in Versailles, Ky., then goes to a second job manning the metal detectors and wrangling rowdy guests at Lexington’s Rupp Arena to supplement her $55,000 annual salary. With her husband, she also runs a historical tour company for extra money.

“I truly love teaching,” says the 52-year-old. “But we are not paid for the work that we do.”

That has become the rallying cry of many of America’s public-school teachers, who have staged walkouts and marches on six state capitols this year. From Arizona to Oklahoma, in states blue, red and purple, teachers have risen up to demand increases in salaries, benefits and funding for public education. Their outrage has struck a chord, reviving a national debate over the role and value of teachers and the future of public education.

For many teachers, this year’s uprising is decades in the making. The country’s roughly 3.2 million full-time public-school teachers (kindergarten through high school) are experiencing some of the worst wage stagnation of any profession, earning less on average, in inflation-­adjusted dollars, than they did in 1990, according to Department of Education (DOE) data.

Meanwhile, the pay gap between teachers and other comparably educated professionals is now the largest on record. In 1994, public-school teachers in the U.S. earned 1.8% less per week than comparable workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a left-leaning think tank. By last year, they made 18.7% less. The situation is particularly grim in states such as Oklahoma, where teachers’ inflation-adjusted salaries actually decreased by about $8,000 in the last decade, to an average of $45,245 in 2016, according to DOE data. In Arizona, teachers’ average inflation-adjusted annual wages are down $5,000.

The decline in education funding is not limited to salaries. Twenty-nine states were still spending less per student in 2015, adjusted for inflation, than they did before the Great Recession, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, leaving many public schools dilapidated, overcrowded and reliant on outdated textbooks and threadbare supplies.

To many teachers, these trends are a result of a decades-long and bipartisan war on public education, born of frustration with teachers’ unions, a desire to standardize curricula and a professed commitment to fiscal austerity. This has led to a widespread expansion of charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated, and actions such as a move in the Wisconsin legislature in 2011 to strip teachers’ pensions and roll back collective bargaining rights. This year, Colorado lawmakers voted to raise teachers’ retirement age and cut benefits.

As states tightened the reins on teacher benefits, many also enacted new benchmarks for student achievement, with corresponding standardized tests, curricula changes and evaluations of teacher performance. The loss of control over their classrooms combined with the direct hit to their pocketbooks was too much for many teachers to bear.

‘I love teaching. But we are not paid for the work that we do.’

The wave began in West Virginia, where in February and March some 20,000 teachers walked out across the state. Educators there—who made an average of $45,701 in 2016, according to the DOE­—refused to enter their classrooms until the state met their demands to fully fund insurance benefits and increase salaries. Instead, they marched on the capitol, passed out bag lunches for low-income students who normally rely on free school meals and watched as public support flooded their way. After nine school days, lawmakers caved and approved a 5% wage increase. Weeks later, the specter of a similar strike led Oklahoma lawmakers to pass the state’s first major tax increase in nearly 30 years to fund raises for teachers who still walked out for more funding. Teachers in Kentucky and Arizona—both GOP-leaning states—followed their lead.

But teachers faced opposition at times from state and federal leaders. In April, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos criticized striking teachers, suggesting they were failing to serve their students and urging them to “keep adult disagreements” out of the classroom.

And when school was out for the summer, the teachers’ momentum was blunted. In June, the Supreme Court ruled that public­-sector unions can’t mandate fees from nonmembers—a decision that experts estimate could cost influential teachers’ unions money and clout. And in August, the Arizona supreme court blocked a ballot initiative that would have added $690 million annually to state education funding.

Teachers are out to regain the upper hand. Some have already gone on strike in Washington State, and others are threatening to do so in Los Angeles and Virginia. And they promise to turn out in force for November’s midterm elections, where hundreds of teachers are running for office on platforms that promise more support for public schools. They have also sought to remind the public that they are on the front lines of America’s frayed social safety net, dealing with children affected by the opioid crisis, living in poverty and fearful of the next school shooting.

Recent polling suggests teachers have the public on their side. Nearly 60% of people in a Ipsos/USA Today survey released Sept. 12 think teachers are underpaid, while a majority of both Republicans and Democrats believe they have the right to strike.

“We have to organize even harder and even broader,” says Los Angeles teacher Rosa Jimenez. “People are fired up.”

When Elaine Hutchison’s mother started teaching in Oklahoma in 1970, she made about $7,000 a year. In 2018 dollars, that’s roughly $45,000—nearly the same salary Hutchison, Oklahoma’s 2013 Teacher of the Year, now makes after a quarter-century on the job. Hutchison, 48, is a fourth-generation educator whose daughter also plans to become a teacher. She says she never got into teaching for the money, but, “I do want to be paid what I’m worth.”

Since the first U.S. public-school system was established in Massachusetts in 1647, many localities have struggled to pay teachers and searched for people willing to do the job for less. In the mid-1800s, California superintendent of public instruction John Swett lamented that the work of teachers was not “as well-paid as the brain labor of the lawyer, the physician, the clergyman, the editor.”

“They ought not to be expected to break mental bread to the children of others and feed their own with stones,” Swett wrote in 1865, foreshadowing arguments still made by teachers today.

‘We have to organize even harder and even broader.’

– Rosa Jimenez, California

Teaching has long been dominated by women, and experts say the roots of its relatively low pay lie in sexism. “The ‘hidden subsidy of public education’ is the fact that teachers for many years were necessarily working at suppressed wage levels because they really had no options other than teaching,” says Susan Moore Johnson, a professor of education at Harvard and an expert in teacher policy.

In 1960, teaching was more lucrative than other comparable careers for women, according to the EPI, but that was because of limited opportunity, not high pay. As women were admitted to other professions in wider numbers, choosing teaching carried a cost. For example registered nurses—another career historically dominated by women—make far more than teachers today, earning an average annual wage of $73,550 in 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nursing shortages in some parts of the U.S. have led to signing bonuses, free housing, tuition reimbursement and other perks, while teacher shortages have contributed to some states increasing class sizes, shortening school weeks and enacting emergency certification for people who aren’t trained as educators.

Nationwide, the estimated average public-school teacher’s salary is now $58,950, according to the National Center for Education Statistics—a respectable income in many locales, but actual wages vary widely by state, and often do not track with costs of living. When compared to professions with similar education levels, teacher pay tends to pale. In 2016, for instance, the average teacher’s starting salary was $38,617—20% lower than that of other professions requiring a college degree.

The public response to the teachers’ protests shows signs of a shift in the perception of the profession. Even in conservative states, many voters backed tax increases to support public education, and called on lawmakers to stop cutting school budgets. State funding for public schools fell off a cliff 10 years ago, when recession-­wracked states slashed education budgets and cut taxes. The uprising in West Virginia seemed to mark a turning point in public support for refilling the coffers.

But like most stories, the fight over teacher pay has many shades of gray. Generous retirement and health-benefits packages negotiated by teachers’ unions in flusher times are a drain on many states. Those who believe most teachers are fairly paid point to those benefits, along with their summer break, to make their case.

Teachers, however, say those apparent perks often disappear upon inspection. Many regularly work over the summer, planning curricula, taking continuing education and professional development courses, and running summer programs at their schools, making it a year-round job. Indeed, teachers—about 40% of whom are not covered by Social Security because of states’ reliance on pension plans—must stay in the same state to collect their pensions. Studies have shown that the majority of new teachers don’t stay in the same district long enough to qualify for pensions. Even for those who do stand to gain, it can be hard to find reassurance in distant retirement benefits when salaries haven’t kept pace with the cost of living.

“Utility companies do not care that you had a great day with one of your students. They don’t care that you’re coaching the soccer team. They want you to pay for the services that they provide you,” says NaShonda Cooke, a teacher and single mother of two in Raleigh, N.C. “I can’t tell you how many letters I got this summer that said final notice.” Cooke, who makes about $69,000, often skips doctor’s appointments to save the co-pay and worries about paying for her eldest daughter’s college education. “It’s not about wanting a pay raise or extra income,” she says. “It’s just about wanting a livable wage.”

Stagnant wages are one reason teachers believe school districts across the country are facing hiring crises. This year in Oklahoma, a record number of teachers were given emergency teaching certifications, despite no traditional training. In Arizona, school districts began recruiting overseas to fill their shortfall. Last year, U.S. public schools hired 2,800 foreign teachers on special visas, up from 1,500 in 2012, according to federal data.

‘I can’t tell you how many letters I got … that said “final notice.”’

-NaShonda Cooke, North Carolina

The pipeline, meanwhile, is drying up. Between 2008 and 2016, the number of new educators completing preparatory programs fell by 23%, according to the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. And once ­teachers make it to the classroom, attrition is high: at least 17% leave the profession within the first five years, a 2015 study found.

Hutchison says her daughter has plans to continue the family teaching tradition, but it’s becoming a harder path for a middle-­class kid. Hutchison’s sibling—an attorney, engineer and physical therapist—all earned graduate degrees, but now she makes half of what they do. “My younger brother who’s an engineer—his bonus is more than my salary,” she says.

As the new school year gets under way, many are picking up where the spring protests left off. In L.A., teachers voted in August to authorize a strike if negotiations continue to stall over issues including teacher pay and class sizes. In Washington, teachers in several districts are already on strike, calling for pay raises to come out of newly allocated education funding. In Virginia, teachers are floating the possibility of a statewide walkout.

Brown, the Kentucky teacher, says the fight needs to happen now or never. If budget cuts and school privatization efforts continue, she warns, teaching will cease to be a viable career for educated, engaged and ambitious people. She talks about what she does not as a job but as a calling. “I’m not necessarily a religious person, but I do believe I was put here to be a teacher,” she says. “I just want to be able to financially do that.”

But to Brown, it’s not only about what she and her fellow teachers are worth, because they’re not in the classroom alone. If the public is on their side, they say, it’s ultimately because of the kids.

Spiegel Online and Die Zeit said the report they obtained — commissioned by the German Bishops Conference and researched by three universities — concludes that more than half of the victims were 13 or younger and most were boys. Every sixth case involved rape and at least 1,670 clergy were involved, both weeklies reported. Die Zeit wrote that 969 abuse victims were altar boys.

The report also says that the actual number of victims was likely much higher, according to the research by experts from the Universities of Giessen, Heidelberg and Mannheim.

The German Bishops Conference said in a written response a few hours later that it regretted the leaking of the report, but that the study confirms “the extent of the sexual abuse” that took place.

“It is depressing and shameful for us,” Bishop Stephan Ackermann said. He didn’t further elaborate on the findings of the report, but said the Catholic group would present the study as initially planned on Sept. 25 together with the authors.

Die Zeit wrote that researchers weren’t allowed to look at the original church files but had to provide questionnaires to the dioceses, which then provided the information.

In their conclusions, the researchers write that there was evidence that some files were manipulated or destroyed, many cases were not brought to justice, and that sometimes abuse suspects — primarily priests — were simply moved to other dioceses without the congregations being informed about their past.

The Catholic Church has been struggling with sex abuse by its clergy for a long time.

In 2010, the German church was roiled by a sex abuse scandal triggered by the head of a Jesuit school in Berlin who went public about decades-long sexual abuse of high school students by clergy. Following that, a whole wave of victims who were sexually abused by clergy spoke out across the country.

An investigation in the United States last month found rampant sexual abuse of more than 1,000 children by about 300 Catholic priests in Pennsylvania.

Earlier this week, the Vatican said it is preparing the “necessary clarifications” about accusations that top Vatican officials including Pope Francis covered up the sexual misconduct of a now-disgraced American ex-cardinal.

Also on Wednesday, the Vatican said it’s summoning the presidents of every bishops conference around the world for a February summit to discuss preventing clergy sex abuse and protecting children.","american excardinal

President Donald Trump approved disaster declaration for Onslow and seven other North Carolina counties on Saturday morning, which includes grant money for temporary housing and repairs and other aid for homeowners or business owners.

The leading edge of the storm tore through North Carolina Friday, leaving at least seven people dead and a million without power. Two of the people killed were a mother and infant when a tree fell on their car. North Carolina just broke its record rainfall set in Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and local emergency responders are waiting to see how high the waters rise.

In New Bern, about 28 miles north of Jacksonville, about 100 people are still waiting to be rescued from flood waters, according to CNN.

Though Florence lost its hurricane status, meteorologists warn that makes it no less dangerous, especially given its slow crawl across the Carolinas and relentless rains.

Nobody knows that better than the residents of Lumberton, a small town in the coastal plains region not far from South Carolina that's still reeling from the devastation wrought by flash flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016.

Many families who lost their homes during Matthew are struggling to keep up with the financial burden posed by weathering multiple events like this.

“The bottom line is that poor people recover differently than rich people do”

Adrienne Kennedy, an environmental advocate, told VICE News that she’d been going door to door, speaking with residents ahead of Florence.

“By yesterday we had gone to more than 300 homes. Most of the people said they just couldn’t go because they’re still recovering from Matthew and don’t have the means,” Kennedy said. “The bottom line is that poor people recover differently than rich people do.”

If and how families evacuate is drawn starkly along socio-economic lines. While wealthier families were able to stock up with gas, generators and fuel, and had enough space to accommodate friends fleeing coastal regions, poorer families sought out shelters or piled together in small homes.

One family who lost everything in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 told VICE News they're still struggling to recover. Their floors are only partially redone, and they’ve turned part of their house into a storage place because they couldn’t afford to repair it to the point where it was livable again.

FEMA helped them buy a new AC unit, but they got no help with other repairs from them. A local church helped them pay for roof repairs. They have home insurance, but it doesn’t cover water damage. Flood insurance is too expensive.

This family lost their cars during Matthew because they could not afford to fill their tanks with gas. This year, they decided to fill one car with gas in case of emergency. Their other car is nearly empty.

Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, has promised to tell investigators everything he knows about what really went down during the 2016 campaign.

He may know a lot.

Manafort spent six months atop the Trump campaign at a time when Russia was allegedly trying to tip the election in Trump’s favor. And Manafort had arrived in Trumpland with a vast network of contacts with ties to the Kremlin. Right before signing up with Trump in spring 2016, Manafort had just wrapped up a decade working closely with powerful Ukrainian and Russian tycoons broadly aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Read: Paul Manafort has agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller

On Friday, Manafort pleaded guilty to reduced charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller’s team, and signed a sweeping deal pledging effectively limitless cooperation.

“This is the most dramatic moment in the investigation thus far,” Seth Waxman, a former federal prosecutor, told VICE News. “Mueller’s team put a lot of resources into going after Paul Manafort. He’s a key individual in the investigation.”

Mueller, who is probing whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Russian efforts to impact the 2016 election, will have a lot ask Manafort about.

Here are some of the areas Manafort can be most helpful in clearing up.

TRUMP TOWER MEETING

In June 2016, at the height of the campaign, Manafort huddled with a small group of top Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower across the table from a lawyer from Moscow named Natalia Veselnitskaya. She’d scored the meeting under the promise of bringing dirt on Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton.

When the meeting came to light months later, Trump’s circle claimed the whole thing had been a big waste of time, and that nothing of substance had been discussed.

But the Trump team’s version of events has been a moving target. Don Jr. initially released a statement saying the group discussed the adoption of Russian children. Later, Trump himself admitted the meeting was aimed at obtaining dirt about his opponent.

Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has insisted Trump didn’t know about the meeting at the time, even though it was attended by Manafort, Don Jr., and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Manafort is now in a position to shed light on that mysterious gathering, and potentially explain just what exactly was discussed in Trump Tower on that summer day. He may even be able to provide details regarding how much Trump himself really knew about the whole thing.

THE ALLEGED SPY

During his years working for former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Manafort’s right-hand man was a translator named Konstantin Kilimnik.

And Kilimnik, according to Mueller’s team, had ties to Russian intelligence that remained active during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.

Kilimnik has strenuously denied that claim, but he has also gone quiet in recent months as the investigation has heated up. This summer, he was indicted in the Mueller probe himself, alongside Manafort, over allegations of witness tampering in Manafort’s case.

Read: Exclusive: First photos emerge of shadowy Manafort aide tied to Russian intelligence

Kilimnik kept in touch with Manafort during the campaign, and traveled to the U.S. to meet with Manafort at least twice. He was also in communication with Manafort’s deputy on the Trump campaign, Rick Gates, even after Manafort was forced out in August 2016, according to documents released in the Mueller probe.

Manafort will now be obliged to answer questions about all of his communications with Kilimnik during the campaign, and about his knowledge of Kilimnik’s background — including any links to Russian intelligence.

THE OLIGARCH

During the campaign, Manafort told Kilimnik to offer up “private briefings” to a Russian oligarch seen as very close to the Kremlin named Oleg Deripaska, according to email records published by The Washington Post and The Atlantic.

Deripaska has repeatedly denied receiving that offer, let alone the briefings.

But within hours of a subsequent meeting between Manafort and Kilimnik in Manhattan in early August 2016, Deripaska’s private jet flew in from Moscow and spent just a few hours on the tarmac in nearby Newark, New Jersey. Then it took off and returned to Moscow.

Deripaska's spokesperson told VICE News that the jet was carrying “Mr. Deripaska’s family only,” and repeated that the Russian businessman had no interactions with Manafort during this time period.

“Mr. Deripaska had no communications, meetings, briefings, or other interaction with Mr. Manafort during, after, or in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election,” the spokesperson told VICE News at the time.

Read: Paul Manafort, a Russian jet and a secret meeting during the 2016 campaign

A month after that jet staged the brief landing in Newark, FBI agents showed up at one of Deripaska’s residences in New York and tried to get him to become an informant, The New York Times reported earlier this month. Investigators pressed Deripaska about whether Manafort had been a link to the Kremlin while working for the Trump campaign, according to the Times.

In April, Deripaska was slapped with sanctions by the U.S. for what the Treasury Department described as broad punishment for Russia’s “worldwide malign activity,” including, among other actions, “attempting to subvert Western democracies.”

Manafort had a previous business relationship with Deripaska that had gone sour, and he was being pursued by Deripaska’s lawyers for millions.

Manafort will now have to tell Mueller’s investigators all about his relationship with the Russian oligarch, and whether their communications during the campaign were more substantial than has been previously acknowledged.

Instead, it’s because hackers figured out how to steal a Tesla Model S by cloning its key fob. WIRED’s resident car-hacking reporter Andy Greenberg broke that news, and explains why the attack might also work on cars from McLaren and Karma.

Lily Hay Newman has the behind-the-scenes story on how hackers got past British Airways defenses in August, plus an alarming report about how a decade-old technique can break the encryption of just about any computer. Yikes.

Former US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter wrote an op-ed in WIRED Friday arguing that big tech and the government have to find a way to work together or everyone will be screwed. And Trump introduced a new executive order aimed at election interference, but we explain why it’s more a bandaid than a cure.

Plenty of other things happened in the security world this week, too. As always, we’ve rounded up all the news we didn’t break or cover in depth this week. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.

Data tracking is creepy. But data tracking children? Much worse. This week, New Mexico's attorney general filed a lawsuit against Tiny Lab, an app developer behind games like Fun Kid Racing, as well as advertising companies including Google and Twitter, alleging that they violated children’s privacy laws by tracking and sharing data for users under the age of 13. When New York Times reporters looked at other apps aimed at young kids on both Google Android and Apple iOS, they found more examples that potentially violate privacy laws by sending children's data to tracking companies. All of this might not surprise you. As the Times notes, it's also in line with academic research that found thousands of Android games and apps for kids shared their data with outside companies in possible violation of the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act.

A bipartisan group of senators sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a letter this week asking him why on earth the State Department hasn’t instituted basic cybersecurity best practices. According to CNET, the senators are concerned that a recent inspection found only 11 percent of the department's required devices have multi-factor authentication enabled. Which is crazy. Nation state hackers all over the world would love to get access to accounts and devices at State. The least American leaders could do to protect the country from prying eyes is follow some rudimentary security tips.

A proposed law in the European Union would require social media platforms and tech companies to remove terror propaganda from their sites within one hour of it being reported to them. If they failed to do so, the companies would face fines up to 4 percent of their worldwide revenue, according to the Wall Street Journal. That would be, uh, a lot: for Alphabet, $4.43 billion; Facebook, $1.63 billion. EU member states still need to sign off, as does the parliament. In the meantime, social networks like Facebook and YouTube are working to improve their moderation systems. Last May, Facebook reported that in Q1 of 2018, nearly 100 percent of the terror-related content it removed had been flagged by the company before users reported it.

Last month, the Associated Press reported that Google was still tracking you even after you turned off location tracking in Google Maps or on your Android device. (We explained how to go about actually turning it off.) People were outraged and felt misled. Now the Arizona attorney general is investigating the matter, according to the Washington Post.

The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Thursday that the UK’s mass surveillance practices violated human rights law. Those practices came to light in 2013, when Edward Snowden revealed that intelligence agencies in the UK were collecting social media, messages, and phone calls, including people not under suspicion for any crimes. The court found that the program violated the right to privacy, according to Gizmodo, due to ""insufficient oversight.""

It’s the car capital of the United States. It’s famous for its curtains of smog, and for stealing a bunch of water once.

But the city is in the midst of a metamorphosis. With fewer, yet stronger storms on the horizon, it’s begun an ambitious plan to cut its reliance on imported water in half by 2025. And it’s emerging as a leader in the frantic international quest to curb emissions—in 2016 alone, it slashed emissions by 11 percent, the equivalent of taking more than 700,000 cars off the road.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

This week, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti joined other leaders, along with activists and business leaders, at the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco. The mission? Stop climate change before it destroys the planet, and our species along with it. Garcetti sat down with WIRED for two interviews, which we have combined and condensed, to talk about how to turn LA into a greentech testbed, why cities have to compete in order to save the world, and what the city can learn from its infamous water wars.

Matt Simon: In what way are cities uniquely positioned to be leaders on climate change?

Eric Garcetti: There's never been more people living in cities, and many of them control directly the most important national assets, like ports and airports and utilities. We have a culture of trying new things, whereas in Washington and other national capitals it's like, Oh make sure it's perfect before it comes to us and then we'll scale it up. Cities are those laboratories of democracy that states used to be. In a city like LA, we're trying to get to this idea of a city as a platform.

MS: So what is LA doing about emissions? It's known as a place of cars, of course, is that part of it? Is it renewable energy?

EG: In Los Angeles, we can't afford not to do all of the above, from energy generation to our building codes to transportation including personal transportation, our mass transit, and our goods movement from the port and our logistical network. We're the number one solar city in America—we've made a pledge to go to 100 percent renewable power, we're reducing our water imports, which consumes a lot of energy. We're cleaning up the port of LA, which is now the greenest port in the world, and made a pledge to go to zero emissions by 2035.

In 2016, the last year we measured, we were down 11 percent, which is the equivalent of 737,000 cars off the road. And by the way, that same year unemployment went down 14 percent. So this whole myth that you can't do that and expand the economy, we're laying to rest, I hope.

MS: People throw their arms up about that—you can't do renewable energy, it'll kill jobs.

EG: We generated 30,000 new green jobs since I've been mayor, so in five years. To put that in perspective, there's 50,000 coal jobs left in America. So this town that’s just 1 percent, roughly, of the US population has created the equivalent of 60 percent of the remaining coal jobs left in America. Appalachia should be doing that, areas that have been hard hit by a recession and not recovered. These are generally good middle class jobs too, not just minimum wage.

MS: There's this interesting dynamic between cities working on this problem that is at once competitive, but also collaborative.

EG: When Shenzhen says, I've got 100 percent already of our bus fleet electrified and all of our taxis, that's good competition for LA to try to catch. And it's collaborative in the sense that when people back in LA say there's no way we can electrify our buses by 2030, I can point to the fact that Shenzhen in China just did it and it took them two and a half, three years. It begins to change people's attitudes.

MS: How much are you enlisting the populace in this? Is it about changing behavior on a wide scale?

EG: It's everything from 25,000 car chargers by 2025, to the work that we're doing to make sure people reduce their water consumption, because we have to use a lot of electricity to bring that water to them. Recycling is now 75 percent. The goal for all megacities is to get to 70 percent, we're already at 75 percent. And that's human behavior of sorting, recycling and demanding. So the most important work is actually in-house, in your own place of work, in your own habits. And then secondarily in what you demand from your elected representatives.

MS: You mentioned water, and I think this is a really key component, especially for LA.

EG: We need to build cities that can survive what is happening, and what will continue to happen even if we can reverse this. Which is there will still be decades of hotter days, extreme weather, and social and health disruptions.

William Mulholland, the great engineer who built out our water system, as told in Chinatown and other movies—I say this is kind of our second Mulholland moment to reengineer a system that instead of stealing other people’s water, we'll recycle, reuse, reduce our water consumption. The fact that my residents stepped up and reduced, in a year, 20 percent of their water use shows we can absolutely do this without feeling it.

MS: Say a city is looking to get into this sort of thing, to clean themselves up, what one piece of advice would you give them?

EG: I'd say go big and be personal. Stretch farther than you think you can reach. And boil it down in human terms. Don't talk about tons of carbon or millions of vehicles. Talk about people's health and sickness and firefighters who are dying on the line with historic fires caused by drought. This isn't about environmentalists who are hobbyists in a little peripheral policy area. This is about everybody's health and their lives. People are dying and those who aren't dying are all suffering under the weight of what's happening.

But autonomous vehicle promoters are undeterred. AI entrepreneur Andrew Ng contends that self-driving cars will be safe for pedestrians when walkers and cyclists conform to their limitations. “What we tell people is, ‘Please be lawful and please be considerate,’” he told Bloomberg.

WIRED OPINION ABOUT Peter Norton is an associate professor in the Department of Engineering and Society at the University of Virginia. He is the author of Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City.

Has Mr Ng ever walked for as much as an hour in a city? If so, he should realize that consideration of pedestrians' needs—and motorists' compliance with the few laws that protect pedestrians—are so deficient that any pedestrian who values their time (as drivers do) must improvise. And in fact, such improvisation can even make pedestrians' journeys safer.

To be fair, Mr. Ng's mistake is a common one. From a driver's point of view, pedestrians' behavior may appear erratic, lawless, and even suicidal. The solution, then, is to train pedestrians to do better, or to restrict them. In actuality, most pedestrians are much smarter than the dumb systems that are intended to control them—far smarter than signals, and even smarter than self-driving cars. A pedestrian who is on the right side of the street and wants to turn left at the next intersection may cross early, at mid-block. What may appear to some as selfish and dangerous rule-breaking may actually be safer and less disruptive to vehicular traffic. In one study of pedestrians aged 65 or older, for example, researchers found that the risk of a pedestrian-motor vehicle collision was 2.1-fold greater at sites with marked crosswalks, particularly those with no traffic signal or stop sign.

In the 1970s, research teams led by William H. Whyte filmed pedestrians on busy sidewalks as they walked around New York City. Walkers filtered past each other with extraordinary efficiency, coming within inches of each other but almost never touching. Such performance requires human intelligence. No one would propose putting pedestrians on autonomous Segways as a way to keep them from colliding with each other. Either traffic would slow almost to a stop, or collisions would increase.

Autonomous vehicles are frequently touted as safer and more efficient alternatives to conventional cars. But if safety and efficiency are indeed primary values, then cities should not deter walking by making it harder, but invite more walking by making it easier. This would entail, among many other things, urging drivers to be more lawful and considerate about pedestrians.

Indeed, the success of self-driving cars depends upon a rise in walking as a practical means of getting around. AVs cannot deliver on their own promises of safety and efficiency if they deter walking. Safety matters because we care about human health. Sedentary living is already inducing health conditions such as heart disease, obesity, and diabetes; public health can only worsen if an autonomous future compels people to ride in cars for every mobility need. And self-driving cars will not be more efficient if we negate their per-mile efficiency benefits by increasing the total miles each person spends in the car.

Smart traffic signals can increase streets' vehicle capacity by shepherding cars safely through intersections without compelling them to stop. But we don't yet know how they'd work for cyclists and pedestrians, those who make the most efficient use of street space, use the least energy, and cause the least danger to others. Either they will have to be equipped with devices that incorporate them into signal systems, or smart signal systems will have to get much better at detecting and tracking them. The social and technical complications of either alternative are substantial.

In the meantime, we have access to innumerable low-tech possibilities. Traffic calming—design features that slow vehicles down—can make select streets much safer for everyone. Planners in the Netherlands, for example, apply humans' smartness, instead of trying to suppress it, by designating certain streets ""bicycle streets""; though drivers can still use them as ""guests,"" they must defer to cyclists. By conventional U.S. standards, this method is considered dangerous because it depends too much on human judgment. But the traffic safety record in the Netherlands should compel us to reconsider. In 2013, there were 3.4 road traffic deaths per 100,000 people in the Netherlands; the figure for the U.S. was 10.6. Extravagant promises about the driverless future too often distract us from implementing effective, inexpensive, low-tech improvements today.

To succeed on their own terms, AV developers will have to do much better by pedestrians. Bloomberg reports that AV developers are looking into ""distinctive sounds—much like the beeping noise large vehicles make when reversing—to help ensure safe interactions between humans and autonomous vehicles."" This technique, in the form of the klaxon or car horn, is well over a century old. Honking was then attacked as a public health menace. Today, such noises can only make the walking environment less inviting, relative to the quiet, climate-controlled interior of a vehicle. For pedestrians who can't afford this alternative, walking will be less pleasant than ever.

Too often we hear extravagant promises for self-driving cars, or warnings that ""the AV future is coming; we have to get ready."" But the saw does not use the carpenter; the carpenter uses the saw. AVs are a tool. We humans have to decide if and how we want to use them. Despite the public relations, AVs will not, on their own, deliver safety or efficiency. We have to put them to work for the purposes of our choosing.

Construction swept through Tokyo as the city prepared to host its first Olympic Games. The Tōkaidō Shinkansen, the original bullet train, sped along the southern coast of Honshu. More cars filled the roads. The only thing not moving, it seemed, were people’s legs.

Prosperity fostered convenience, which encouraged inactivity—or so a doctor reportedly told the founder of Yamasa Tokei Keiki. In response, the company released the world’s first commercial pedometer, the manpo-kei. Kei means “meter,” and manpo, “10,000 steps.”

In East Asia, 10,000 had long been shorthand for plenty, or even infinite vastness, but affixed to a fitness gadget the number solidified. Once a medical researcher endorsed 10,000 steps as the threshold for being an “active” adult, manpo crossed from idiom to science and, in the process, became the best kind of goal: exact, plausible, and resettable. Didn’t get to 10,000? Tomorrow is another day. A wave of walking clubs overtook Japan.

Fitbit sold 21.4 million devices in 2015, the year it went public, and 22.3 million in 2016. Then smartwatches happened.

Americans, wedded to their own conveniences, were slow to catch up. Sure, running took root as a pastime in the ’70s, and an ’80s fervor for “mall walking” led to hordes of retirees Rockporting their way through suburban gallerias. But quantified stepping didn’t come to US shores until 2008, courtesy of entrepreneurs James Park and Eric Friedman. “I had been working like crazy at startups over the last three years and really let myself go in terms of fitness,” Park said at the time.

Not long after, he and Friedman released the Fitbit Tracker. It looked like a clothespin had mated with a stapler: a tiny matte-black pincer with an even tinier lowercase fitbit printed in light gray, a handy reminder when you inevitably found it in the dryer. (Googling “fitbit laundry” pulls up nearly 15 million results.) A single button cycled through the display so you could see your march toward that magical 10,000, rendered as a blue flower. “Keep moving to keep the flower growing,” read the user manual. A botanical Tamagotchi, feeding off your efforts.

There were numbers too—and oh, the numbers. They were our eyes turned inward, the power to see what our bodies had done and were doing. Metabolic rhythms, miraculous alchemies, made quantifiable for the first time outside our medical charts. We became mech pilots, armed with a brand-new instrument panel to steer our clumsy selves through the world. When you logged in to check your mech’s maintenance records—How many calories has it burned this week? How many times does it wake up on an average night?—you saw those of your fellow pilots as well.

I remember the game. Not only did I have manpo to keep pace with, but mankind itself. The college buddy whose new role as father was snaring him 4,000 steps before the workday started. The colleague who walked to work while I took the bus like a sucker. Hell, I once strapped my tracker around my ankle for a four-hour bike ride, spinning up a European vacation’s worth of footfalls. The prize was an anguished email from a rival wondering how I’d juiced my total.

As Fitbit introduced new products, the deceptions diversified. One step-fluffer taped his tracker to an electric saw blade and left it on overnight. Others gave their Fitbits to their dogs. Compared to them, my favorite hack—brushing my teeth like a coke-addled drum major—seemed downright Calvinist.

By 2014, Fitbit had a 67 percent share of the activity-tracking marketplace. It sold 21.4 million devices in 2015, the year it went public, and 22.3 million in 2016. Then smartwatches happened. If you were a serious athlete, you were more likely to upgrade to a serious device, with structured workouts and advanced metrics. If you weren’t, something like an Apple Watch just looked a lot cooler and worked with the rest of your app-driven life. By 2017, Fitbit's stock had dropped by more than half. Slowly at first, and then faster, the OG fitness tracker tumbled into the gap in the middle.

It made sense. At first, being a mech was fun—the numbers, the feedback, the idea that you could use it all to make yourself healthier, better. But in the decade since the Fitbit was born, another feedback device emerged and demanded even more attention. It, too, showed you glimpses of other people’s lives, or at least the lives they wanted you to think they led. But your smartphone didn’t bother with flower power. It asked not for your effort but for your time, and there was little reward.

Spurred by sales of its own watch, Fitbit’s stock has recently twitched back to life. Meanwhile, more and more people are taking steps to distance themselves from their technological dependencies. These aren’t literal steps. But they might be the healthiest steps of all.

Yes, this storm is big, but to give you an idea of just how large, consider: The ISS orbits 254 miles above Earth, and astronauts still had to deploy a wide angle lens to capture the entirety of the storm. The eye of the storm is calm, but the arms of Florence stretch around, looking almost like a white galaxy transplanted into home planet’s atmosphere.

There is a lot going on in this photo of black holes colliding, so let’s break it down. This dazzling image of galaxy AM 0644-741 is a combination of data sets from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory (seen here in the purples), and the Hubble Space Telescope (reds, greens, and blues). The ring around the center glows in the x-ray spectrum and is made up of either black holes or dense neutron stars—scientists can’t say for sure.

Hubble recently captured Saturn when it was closest in its orbit to Earth. This composite image shows the planet and six of its 62 moons. Look very closely and you can spot, from left to right: Dione, Enceladus, Tethys, Janus, Epimetheus, and Mimas. The gaps in the rings are beautifully defined and you can even make out the bizarre hexagon storm at the north pole.

These mesmerizing hills are called falling dunes, and they are some of the rarer sorts of features on our neighboring red planet. This false-colored image taken by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2014 is meant to bring out the dunes’ shadows and details. Falling dunes are created not so much by wind, but by smaller grain particles being carried downhill by the force of gravity.

All is quiet out there in the great expanse and especially out at galaxy NGC 4036. This galaxy is known for its hazy cloud of dust that stretches far out into space, making it appear like some galactic night-light. The bright star to the right isn’t located in the galaxy, but lives between us and NGC 4036.","hubble space telescope reds greens

And so companies like Facebook and YouTube have long relied on artificial intelligence to help surface things like spam and pornography.

Something like a white supremacist meme, though, can be more challenging for machines to flag, since the task requires processing several different visual elements at once. Automated systems need to detect and “read” the words that are overlaid on top of the photo, as well as analyze the image itself. Memes are also complicated cultural artifacts, which can be difficult to understand out of context. Despite the challenges they bring, some social platforms are already using AI to analyze memes, including Facebook, which this week shared details about how it uses a tool called Rosetta to analyze photos and videos that contain text.

Facebook says it already uses Rosetta to help automatically detect content that violates things like its hate speech policy. With help from the tool, Facebook also announced this week that it’s expanding its third-party fact checking effort to include photos and videos, not just text-based articles. Rosetta will aid in the process by automatically checking whether images and videos that contain text were previously flagged as false.

Rosetta works by combining optical character recognition (OCR) technology with other machine learning techniques to process text found in photos and videos. First, it uses OCR to identify where the text is located in a meme or video. You’ve probably used something like OCR before; it’s what allows you to quickly scan a paper form and turn it into an editable document. The automated program knows where blocks of text are located and can tell them apart from the place where you’re supposed to sign your name.

Once Rosetta knows where the words are, Facebook uses a neural network that can transcribe the text and understand its meaning. It then can feed that text through other systems, like one that checks whether the meme is about an already-debunked viral hoax.

The researchers behind Rosetta say the tool now now extracts text from every image uploaded publicly to Facebook in real time, and it can “read” text in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, German, and Arabic. (Facebook says Rosetta is not used to scan images that users share privately on their timelines or in direct messages.)

Rosetta can analyze images that include text in many forms, such as photos of protest signs, restaurant menus, storefronts, and more. Viswanath Sivakumar, a software engineer at Facebook who works on Rosetta, said in an email that the tool works well both for identifying text in a landscape, like on a street sign, and also for memes—but that the latter is more challenging. “In the context of proactively detecting hate speech and other policy-violating content, meme-style images are the more complex AI challenge,” he wrote.

Unlike humans, an AI also typically needs to see tens of thousands of examples before it can learn to complete a complicated task, says Sivakumar. But memes, even for Facebook, are not endlessly available, and gathering enough examples in different languages can also prove difficult. Finding high-quality training data is an ongoing challenge for artificial intelligence research more broadly. Data often needs to be painstakingly hand-labeled, and many databases are protected by copyright laws.

'In the context of proactively detecting hate speech and other policy-violating content, meme-style images are the more complex AI challenge.' Viswanath Sivakumar, Facebook

To train Rosetta, Facebook researchers used images posted publicly on the site that contained some form of text, along with their captions and the location from which they were posted. They also created a program to generate additional examples, inspired by a method devised by a team of Oxford University researchers in 2016. That means the entire process is automated to some extent: One program automatically spits out the memes, and then another tries to analyze them.

Different languages are challenging for Facebook’s AI team in other ways. For example, the researchers had to find a workaround to make Rosetta work with languages like Arabic, which are read from right to left, the opposite of other languages like English. Rosetta “reads” Arabic backwards, then after processing, Facebook reverses the characters. “This trick works surprisingly well, allowing us to have a unified model that works for both left to right and right to left languages,” the researchers wrote in their blog post.

While automated systems can be extremely useful for content moderation purposes, they’re not always foolproof. For example, WeChat—the most popular social network in China—uses two different algorithms to filter images, which a team of researchers at the Univeristy of Toronto’s Citizen Lab were able to successfully trick. The first, an OCR-based program, filters photos that contain text about prohibited topics, while the other censors images that appear similar to those on a blacklist likely created by the Chinese government.

The researchers were able to easily evade WeChat’s filters by changing an image’s properties, like the coloring or the way it was oriented. While Facebook’s Rosetta is more sophisticated, it likely isn’t perfect either; the system may be tripped up by hard-to-read text, or warped fonts. All image recognition algorithms are also still potentially susceptible to adversarial examples, slightly altered images that look the same to humans but cause an AI to go haywire.

Facebook and other platforms like Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit are under tremendous pressure in multiple countries to police certain kinds of content. On Wednesday, the European Union proposed new legislation that require social media companies to remove terrorist posts within one hour of notification, or else face fines. Rosetta, and other similarly automated tools, are what already help Facebook and other platforms abide by similar laws in places like Germany.

And they’re getting better at their jobs: Two years ago CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook’s AI systems only proactively caught around half of the content the company took down; people had to flag the rest first. Now, Facebook says that its AI tools detect nearly 100 percent of the spam it takes down, as well as 99.5 percent of terrorist content and 86 percent of graphic violence. Other platforms, like YouTube, have seen similar success using automated content detection systems.

But those promising numbers don’t mean AI systems like Rosetta are a perfect solution, especially when it comes to more nuanced forms of expression. Unlike a restaurant menu, it can be hard to parse the meaning of a meme without knowing the context of where it was posted. That's why there are whole websites dedicated to explaining them. Memes often depict inside jokes, or are highly specific to a certain online subculture. And AI still isn’t capable of understanding a meme or video in the same way that a person would. For now, Facebook will still need to to rely on human moderators to make decisions about whether a meme should be taken down.

I'm not sure I want to, either. Following the violent archaeologist on a quest to a hidden city with the lofty goal of stopping an ancient apocalypse, Shadow of the Tomb Raider is a competent, occasionally enjoyable action-adventure romp. It'd be great, if only it weren't so nasty.

Lara Croft is defined by her ability to endure pain. One of the earliest moments of the games is pure claustrophobia. Lara is wedged in a crevice deep underground, nearly crushed between two sheer rock walls as another rock pins her legs down. The camera lingers intimately as she agonizingly uses a knife to work the rock off of her lower leg, scraping off skin, groaning and squirming. The scene immediately before this, the literal first moments of the game, showcase Lara getting into a plane crash.

The new Tomb Raider series is built on the foundation of Lara's pain. In the first game, the pain was at least expressive, a crucible through which Lara Croft could go from a naive young woman into a hero, a fighter, the insatiable curious and bloodthirsty heroine of the 1990s. Back then, pain was a form of redemption for Lara, and while that isn't without its problems—why must a woman be physically injured to grow?—it was at least a meaningful idea, and Lara's mantra, a slow, breathy ""I can do this"" before confrontation, had a power to it.

That was two games ago, and yet Lara, supposedly fully developed into her heroic self a long time ago, still regularly gets stabbed, impaled, mauled, nearly drowned, and shot. Every time the player dies in this game, something awful happens to this woman. My own failures made me cringe, as I had to see some horrific punishment inflicted on her.

The problem in Shadow of the Tomb Raider is that this suffering feels without expressive purpose. It doesn't carry sufficient weight to justify itself.

Lara Croft is born to suffer, and Lara Croft is also born to dole out suffering. Violence follows her everywhere. The game begins with Lara making a terrible mistake out of greed and desperation, a mistake that kills countless people. In another early scene, a supernatural tsunami—caused by Lara's plundering—consumes an entire Mexican town. Another vignette depicts a child dying. This, the game says, is Lara's fault. Shadow of the Tomb Raider then has Lara go on a warpath of her own, murdering droves of her enemies in pursuit of redemption and knowledge, even as the game halfheartedly attempts to encourage Lara to learn to be, well, less of a tomb raider and more of a tomb visitor. Hundreds of people die in this game to teach Lara Croft a lesson in humility.

The problem in Shadow of the Tomb Raider is that this suffering feels without expressive purpose. It doesn't carry sufficient weight to justify itself. In these games, people suffer as mild, milquetoast entertainment. Crystal Dynamics, whether purposefully or by accident, have created games that feel, first and foremost, cruel. This would be less insulting if the games weren't so competently made. The combat, the sneaking, the labyrinths of puzzles that feel both sprawling and tightly focused—it all pops. There is a legitimate and powerful sense of tension here, and in a game that was framed with less brutality, a more bright and cheerful and playful sort of adventure, there would be a lot to recommend.

But over the course of three games, the tone of Tomb Raider has curdled. Lara Croft often gets compared to Indiana Jones, but disregarding their mutual tendency toward appropriation and violence instead of archaeology, the two have little in common. Lara's world is mean in its heart in a way that Indy's never was. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is a nasty game, and if this series continues, I hope it veers in a wholly different direction. I'm tired of watching Lara Croft get impaled on spikes.

A new study funded by Google.org and the US Agency for International Development asks whether the poor would benefit more if they were given cash and free to spend the money as they see fit.

A number of studies on unconditional cash transfers are underway, but the government agency’s involvement demonstrates a willingness to question whether the status quo is cost effective, says Michael Faye, cofounder and director of the US-based nonprofit GiveDirectly, which distributed the mobile cash in 248 villages in Rwanda, where the study took place.

USAID’s involvement had been kept quiet to avoid controversy over using taxpayer funds to give money to people in Africa, reports The New York Times. Daniel Handel, the USAID official who instigated the trial, got the idea after hearing about GiveDirectly on NPR while stationed in Rwanda. Handel is now a senior adviser on aid effectiveness at USAID, a job that was created for him.

Researchers had two goals: compare an established program to combat childhood malnutrition with giving people the equivalent value ($117) in cash, and compare the cash equivalent to a much larger sum, $532.1 After a year, results, released Thursday, found that neither the established program nor its cash equivalent were able to improve child health, but the large cash transfers significantly improved people’s health and financial standing.

On the surface, that’s not surprising. Of course giving people more than four times as much money gives them access to better nutrition. But the study’s coauthor, Andrew Zeitlin, a professor from Georgetown, says the idea was to provide benchmarks for future programs; it’s not unusual for nutritional aid programs to cost $500 or even $800 per recipient, he says.

The traditional malnutrition program, called Gikuriro, was funded by USAID and administered Catholic Relief Services. It combined help with water, sanitation, and hygiene with training on nutrition, some small livestock and seeds, and guidance on financial habits like saving. The study focused on households with children under the age of 5 and women of reproductive age, with an emphasis on the first 1,000 days of the child’s life.

The results indicate that Gikuriro helped recipients increase their savings and increased overall health knowledge and vaccination rates in villages, two of the program’s goals. However, neither the malnutrition program nor its cash equivalent led to a more diverse diet or improved child health, as measured by height and weight. The larger cash transfer, on the other hand, led to improvements in food diversity, a drop in child mortality, an increase in household wealth, and improvements in child health measurements, as well as improvements in village vaccination rates. USAID did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The health gains from the $532 transfers were modest, says Zeitlin, considering that the children in the study were well below the World Health Organization’s guidelines for height and weight, with evidence of chronic malnutrition. “It is an improvement for sure and one to be celebrated, and may be relatively good value for money compared to other programming in this space,” he says.

GiveDirectly says it is involved with five other studies testing how well cash transfers can achieve USAID’s goals, like youth empowerment, including experiments in Malawi, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and another study comparing cash to a youth employment project in Rwanda. Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife, Cari Tuna, have donated more than $50 million to GiveDirectly over the years through their foundation Good Ventures, $15 million of which is earmarked to support cash-transfer studies. Google.org contributed $2 million to the study released Thursday, part of $6.4 million it has donated to GiveDirectly since 2012; the funding also supported cash-transfer initiatives in Kenya and Uganda, as well as a grant to launch three studies on impact and design.

Silicon Valley philanthropists, who increasingly prefer to structure charitable donations like a business venture, have gravitated to unconditional cash programs, such as the idea of universal basic income. For them, the concept ticks all the right boxes. It’s a contrarian idea that questions conventional thinking about international aid, it has low overhead, it’s easily scalable using mobile phones, and it’s measurable.

Faye, the GiveDirectly cofounder, called the study “the first ever A/B test for USAID.” Zeitlin, the Georgetown professor and coauthor of the study, says this research aligns with Silicon Valley’s interest in disruptive ideas because it questions the effectiveness of traditional aid programs.

A recent cash-transfer study showed early gains disappearing over time. Initially, a program in Uganda raised hopes after young adults who received cash were earning 38 percent more than a control group after four years. But after nine years, the control group was earning just as much as the beneficiaries who received cash, according to a new paper released in September.

Still, tracking the way beneficiaries spend the cash gives researchers a window into what recipients actually need, value, and believe is in their best interest—insights that could add nuance to future aid programs. For instance, the study found that cash recipients chose to pay down debt rather than increasing savings, which may make more sense if they are dealing with high interest rates. “That is a great example of a donor preference that is probably not what beneficiaries would choose,” Faye says.
